http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0393v1,Standards for Graph Algorithm Primitives,"  It is our view that the state of the art in constructing a large collection
of graph algorithms in terms of linear algebraic operations is mature enough to
support the emergence of a standard set of primitive building blocks. This
paper is a position paper defining the problem and announcing our intention to
launch an open effort to define this standard.

featuring drastic optical property contrast upon solid-state phase transition,
have found widespread adoption in photonic switches and routers, reconfigurable
meta-optics, reflective display, and optical neuromorphic computers. Current
phase change materials, such as Ge-Sb-Te (GST), exhibit large contrast of both
refractive index (delta n) and optical loss (delta k), simultaneously. The
coupling of both optical properties fundamentally limits the function and
performance of many potential applications. In this article, we introduce a new
class of O-PCMs, Ge-Sb-Se-Te (GSST) which breaks this traditional coupling, as
demonstrated with an optical figure of merit improvement of more than two
orders of magnitude. The first-principle computationally optimized alloy,
Ge2Sb2Se4Te1, combines broadband low optical loss (1-18.5 micron), large
optical contrast (delta n = 2.0), and significantly improved glass forming
ability, enabling an entirely new field of infrared and thermal photonic
devices. We further leverage the material to demonstrate nonvolatile integrated
optical switches with record low loss and large contrast ratio, as well as an
electrically addressed, microsecond switched pixel level spatial light
modulator, thereby validating its promise as a platform material for scalable
nonvolatile photonics.

connectivity of different sized pores in a porous medium, and macroscopic state
descriptors ""radius-resolved saturations"" ($\psi_w(F),\psi_n(F)$) to

large accessivity ($\alpha\to1$) corresponds to more parallel arrangements, as
the classical capillary bundle model implicitly assumes. Based on these

formulae for updating $\psi_n(F)$ that naturally capture capillary pressure
hysteresis, with $\alpha$ controlling the amount of hysteresis. These concepts
may be used to interpret hysteretic data, upscale pore-scale observations, and
formulate new constitutive laws by providing a simple conceptual framework for

http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0191v1,Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution,"  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather
unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

Essential aspects to overcoming these issues are the development of nonvolatile
optical reconfiguration techniques which are compatible with on-chip
integration with different photonic platforms and do not disrupt their optical
performances. In this paper, a solution is demonstrated using an optoelectronic
framework for nonvolatile tunable photonics that employs undoped-graphene

developed to precisely interpret the switching characteristics, and to quantify
the impact of current saturation on power dissipation, thermal diffusion, and

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9501031v1,The Mass Distribution of the Lens Galaxy in MG1131+0456,"  We present the results of modeling 5, 8 and 15 GHz maps of the gravitational
lens MG1131+0456 using the LensClean algorithm. Two models for the mass
distribution in the lens were fit: a de Vaucouleurs model and a model with the
two-dimensional potential phi = b^{2-alpha}(r^2+s^2)^{alpha/2}/2alpha, both in
an external shear field. The best fit de Vaucouleurs model has an effective
radius of R_e = 0.83+-0.13 arcseconds, larger than that measured at optical
wavelengths. The best fit ``alpha model'' has alpha=0.6+-0.2 and a core radius
of s = 0.19 +- 0.07 arcseconds. An isothermal model (alpha=1) is inconsistent
with the data. The best alpha model fits the 8 GHz map significantly better
than the best de Vaucouleurs model. Although it is difficult to distinguish
visually the original image and the reconstructions, none of the models is
statistically consistent with the data. We believe the primary problem is that
an external shear is an inadequate model for the angular structure of the lens
galaxy. The finite core radius in the models is required by the structure of
the extended ring, so we confirm that the central component in the 8 GHz map is
a central, lensed image of the source rather than the lens galaxy. The model
lens positions, the position angle of the shear, and the mass interior to the
ring are determined very precisely by the lens models. The time delay between
the compact components is predicted with an uncertainty we estimate to be at
most +- 9%; the formal uncertainty is +- 4%.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03413v2,Precision measurements of A=3 nuclei in Hall B,"  We propose a high-statistics measurement of few body nuclear structure and
short range correlations in quasi-elastic scattering at 6.6 GeV from $^2$H,
$^3$He and $^3$H targets in Hall B with the CLAS12 detector.
  We will measure absolute cross sections for $(e,e'p)$ and $(e,e'pN)$
quasi-elastic reaction channels up to a missing momentum $p_{miss} \approx 1$
GeV/c over a wide range of $Q^2$ and $x_B$ and construct the isoscalar sum of
$^3$H and $^3$He. We will compare $(e,e'p)$ cross sections to nuclear theory
predictions using a wide variety of techniques and $NN$ interactions in order
to constrain the $NN$ interaction at short distances. We will measure
$(e,e'pN)$ quasi-elastic reaction cross sections and $(e,e'pN)/(e,e'p)$ ratios
to understand short range correlated (SRC) $NN$ pairs in the simplest
non-trivial system. $^3$H and $^3$He, being mirror nuclei, exploit the maximum
available isospin asymmetry. They are light enough that their ground states are
readily calculable, but they already exhibit complex nuclear behavior,
including $NN$ SRCs. We will also measure $^2$H$(e,e'p)$ in order to help
theorists constrain non-quasielastic reaction mechanisms in order to better
calculate reactions on $A=3$ nuclei. Measuring all three few body nuclei
together is critical, in order to understand and minimize different reaction
effects, such as single charge exchange final state interactions, in order to
test ground-state nuclear models.
  We will also measure the ratio of inclusive $(e,e')$ quasi-elastic cross
sections (integrated over $x_B$) from $^3$He and $^3$H in order to extract the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05737v1,Acceleration Profiles and Processing Methods for Parabolic Flight,"  Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to ""weightless""
or reduced gravity conditions experienced in space or on planetary surfaces,
e.g. the Moon or Mars. These flights facilitate fundamental research - from
materials science to space biology - and testing/validation activities that
support and complement infrequent and costly access to space. While parabolic
flights have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration profiles and
processing methods are not widely available - yet are critical for assessing
the results of these activities. Here we present a method for collecting,
analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during
a parabolic flight. We validated this method using a commercially available
accelerometer during a Boeing 727-200F flight with $20$ parabolas. All data and
analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be easily integrated with
a variety of experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer
orientation, and allows for unsupervised and repeatable classification of all
phases of flight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to
quantifying gravito-intertial accelerations (GIA), or $g$ levels. As academic,
governmental, and commercial use of space increases, data availability and
validated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and
analysis of parabolic flight experiments, and thus, facilitate future space
activities.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15172v1,"Effect of two parallel intruders on net work during granular
  penetrations","  The impact of single passive intruders into granular particles has been
studied in detail. However, the impact force produced by multiple intruders
separated at a distance from one another, and hence the effect of their
presence in close proximity to one another, is largely unexplored. Here, we use
numerical simulations and laboratory experiments to study the force response of
two parallel rods intruding vertically into granular media while varying the
gap spacing between them. We also explored the effect of variations in
friction, intruder size, and particle size on the force response. The net work
($W$) of the two rods over the depth of intrusion was measured, and the
instantaneous velocities of particles over the duration of intrusion were
calculated by simulations. We found that the work done by the intruders changes
with distance between them. We observed a peak in $W$ at a gap spacing of
$\sim$3 particle diameters, which was up to 25% greater than $W$ at large
separation (\textgreater 11 particle diameters), beyond which the net work
plateaued. This peak was likely due to less particle flow between intruders as
we found a larger number of strong forces---identified as force chains---in the
particle domain at gaps surrounding the peak force. Although higher friction
caused greater force generation during intrusion, the gap spacing between the
intruders at which the peak work was generated remained unchanged. Larger
intruder sizes resulted in greater net work with the peak in $W$ occurring at
slightly larger intruder separations. Taken together, our results show that
peak work done by two parallel intruders remained within a narrow range,
remaining robust to most other tested parameters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12767v1,Space VLBI 2020: Science and Technology Futures Conference Summary,"  The ""Space VLBI 2020: Science and Technology Futures"" meeting was the second
in The Future of High-Resolution Radio Interferometry in Space series. The
first meeting (2018 September 5--6; Noordwijk, the Netherlands) focused on the
full range of science applications possible for very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) with space-based antennas. Accordingly, the observing
frequencies (wavelengths) considered ranged from below 1~MHz (> 300 m) to above
300~GHz (< 1 mm). For this second meeting, the focus was narrowed to mission
concepts and the supporting technologies to enable the highest angular
resolution observations at frequencies of 30~GHz and higher (< 1 cm).
  This narrowing of focus was driven by both scientific and technical
considerations. First, results from the RadioAstron mission and the Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) have generated considerable excitement for studying the
inner portions of black hole (BH) accretion disks and jets and testing elements
of the General Theory of Relativity (GR). Second, the technologies and
requirements involved in space-based VLBI differ considerably between 100~MHz
and 100~GHz; a related consideration is that there are a number of existing
instruments or mission concepts for frequencies of approximately 100~MHz and
below, while it has been some time since attention has been devoted to space
VLBI at frequencies above 10~GHz.
  This conference summary attempts to capture elements of presentations and
discussions that occurred.

the relationship between the observable properties of the H$\alpha$ filaments
and the kinetic and radiative feedback from supermassive black holes in BCGs.
We find that the spatial extent and total mass of the filaments show positive
correlations with AGN feedback power and can therefore be used as probes of the
AGN activity. We also examine the relationship between the AGN feedback power
and velocity dispersion of the H$\alpha$ filaments and find that the kinetic
luminosity shows statistically significant correlation with the component of
the velocity dispersion along the jet axis but not the components perpendicular
to it.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210671v1,Electromagnetic Outflows and GRBs,"  We study the dynamics of relativistic electromagnetic explosions as a

rotating relativistic stellar-mass progenitor loses much of its spin energy in
the form of an electromagnetically-dominated outflow.
  After the flow becomes optically thin, it forms a relativistically expanding,
non-spherically symmetric magnetic bubble - a ''cold fireball''. We analyze the
structure and dynamics of such a cavity in the force-free approximation. During
relativistic expansion, most of the magnetic energy in the bubble is
concentrated in a thin shell near its surface (contact discontinuity). We
suggest that either the polar current or the shell currents become unstable to
electromagnetic instabilities at a radius $\sim10^{16}$ cm. This leads to
acceleration of pairs and causes the $\gamma$-ray emission. At a radius
$\sim10^{17}$ cm, the momentum contained in the electromagnetic shell will have
been largely transferred to the surrounding blast wave propagating into the
circumstellar medium. Particles accelerated at the fluid shock may combine with
electromagnetic field from the electromagnetic shell to produce the afterglow
emission.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13920v2,"Re-examining rates of lithium-ion battery technology improvement and
  cost decline","  Lithium-ion technologies are increasingly employed to electrify
transportation and provide stationary energy storage for electrical grids, and
as such their development has garnered much attention. However, their
deployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption will depend
on their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement.
Understanding this potential can inform critical climate change mitigation
strategies, including public policies and technology development efforts.
However, many existing models of past cost decline, which often serve as
starting points for forecasting models, rely on limited data series and
measures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize,
and combine various data series of price, market size, research and
development, and performance of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop
representative series for these measures and employ performance curve models to
estimate improvement rates. We also develop a method to incorporate additional
performance characteristics into these models, including energy density and
specific energy performance metrics. When energy density is incorporated into
the definition of service provided by a lithium-ion cell, estimated
technological improvement rates increase considerably, suggesting that
previously reported improvement rates might underestimate the rate of
lithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our estimates suggest the degree to
which lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by
performance requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also
suggest that battery technologies developed for stationary applications, where
restrictions on volume and mass are relaxed, might achieve faster cost
declines, though engineering-based mechanistic cost modeling is required to
further characterize this potential.

  of the Jodrell Bank ``Golden Lenses'' Workshop","  Gravitational lensing is now widely and successfully used to study a range of
astronomical phenomena, from individual objects, like galaxies and clusters, to
the mass distribution on various scales, to the overall geometry of the
Universe. Here we describe and assess the use of gravitational lensing as
``gold standards'' in addressing one of the fundamental problems in astronomy,
the determination of the absolute distance scale to extragalactic objects. This
is commonly parameterized by the Hubble constant, $H_0$, the current expansion
rate of the Universe. The elegance of the underlying geometrical principle of
the gravitational lensing method combined with the recent advances in
observations and modelling makes it a very promising technique for measuring
$H_0$.

of the magnetic to particle energy-densities in the inflowing region) and the
Lundquist number $S$. The inflow velocity may be relativistic (for $ S<
\sigma$) or non-relativistic (for $ S > \sigma$), while the outflowing plasma
is moving always relativisticly. For extremely magnetized plasmas with $\sigma
\geq S^2$, the inflow four-velocity becomes of the order of the \Alfven

sub-picosecond bursts and far exceeds linear theory. Forward SRS and re-scatter
of back SRS are also observed. The plasma wave frequency downshifts from the

is consistent with trapping and reduces the Landau damping. There is some
acoustic ($\omega\propto k$) activity and possibly electron acoustic scatter.
Kinetic ions do not affect SRS for early times but suppress it later on. SRS
from inhomogeneous plasmas exhibits a kinetic enhancement for long density
scale lengths. More scattering results when the pump propagates to higher as

resolution images are backpropagated to train the networks. Our proposed method
is evaluated on FERET data set and compared with state-of-the-art competing
methods. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed method
significantly improves the recognition performance especially for very low

Furthermore, it can reconstruct a high resolution image from its corresponding
low resolution probe image which is comparable with state-of-the-art
super-resolution methods in terms of visual quality.

impurities close to the core is thoroughly investigated and the dependence of
the zero-flux impurity density gradient (peaking factor) on local plasma
parameters is presented. Parameters such as ion-to-electron temperature ratio,
electron temperature gradient and main species density gradient mainly affect
the impurity peaking through their impact on mode characteristics. The poloidal
asymmetry, the safety factor and magnetic shear have the strongest effect on
impurity peaking, and it is shown that under certain scenarios where trapped
electron modes are dominant, core accumulation of high-Z impurities can be
avoided. We demonstrate that accounting for the momentum conservation property
of the impurity-impurity collision operator can be important for an accurate

desalination technologies has grown rapidly to fill the void. One such
developing technology, membrane distillation (MD), has experienced keen
academic interest and an increase in start-up businesses in the past decade. MD
has expanded into a niche of small scale thermal desalination using solar and
waste heat resources, due to its fouling resistance, scalability, and
acceptable efficiency. Recent studies indicate that MD could attain the
efficiencies of state-of-the-art mature thermal desalination technologies,
although additional engineering and scientific challenges must first be

  The aim of this research is to better understand and provide solutions for
two major challenge areas for MD: efficiency and membrane fouling. Studies on
improving MD efficiency included examining the effects of tilt angle on MD
performance using numerical simulations paired with experiments, devising a
novel MD system design for with superhydrophobic surfaces to improved
efficiencies, and an entropy-generation comparison of MD to other desalination
technologies. For fouling studies in MD, a review of MD fouling was undertaken
to synthesize conclusions from the literature and to explore gaps in the
literature. This review lead to studies of the effect of filtration and bulk
nucleation on MD fouling, a study on heterogeneous nucleation of inorganic
salts with a fouling regime map to avoid nucleation, and fouling prevention via
induced air-layers.
