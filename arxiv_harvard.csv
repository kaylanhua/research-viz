http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3674v1,The Dynamic X-ray Sky of the Local Universe,"  Over the next decade, we can expect time domain astronomy to flourish at
optical and radio wavelengths. In parallel with these efforts, a dedicated
transient ""machine"" operating at higher energies (X-ray band through soft
gamma-rays) is required to reveal the unique subset of events with variable
emission predominantly visible above 100 eV. Here we focus on the transient
phase space never yet sampled due to the lack of a sensitive, wide-field and
triggering facility dedicated exclusively to catching high energy transients
and enabling rapid coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. We first describe
the advancements in our understanding of known X-ray transients that can only
be enabled through such a facility and then focus on the classes of transients
theoretically predicted to be out of reach of current detection capabilities.
Finally there is the exciting opportunity of revealing new classes of X-ray
transients and unveiling their nature through coordinated follow-up
observations at longer wavelengths.

Using photographic plates with higher sensitivity and spatial resolution taken

http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0293v2,The Effective Field Theory of Inflation,"  We study the effective field theory of inflation, i.e. the most general
theory describing the fluctuations around a quasi de Sitter background, in the
case of single field models. The scalar mode can be eaten by the metric by
going to unitary gauge. In this gauge, the most general theory is built with
the lowest dimension operators invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms, like
g^{00} and K_{mu nu}, the extrinsic curvature of constant time surfaces. This
approach allows us to characterize all the possible high energy corrections to
simple slow-roll inflation, whose sizes are constrained by experiments. Also,
it describes in a common language all single field models, including those with
a small speed of sound and Ghost Inflation, and it makes explicit the
implications of having a quasi de Sitter background. The non-linear realization
of time diffeomorphisms forces correlation among different observables, like a
reduced speed of sound and an enhanced level of non-Gaussianity.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3482v1,Code injection attacks on harvard-architecture devices,"  Harvard architecture CPU design is common in the embedded world. Examples of
Harvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors.
Mica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets.
Stack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and then
execute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that code
injection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remote
code injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit program
vulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memory
of an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result that
presents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work only
succeeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injecting
permanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of the
target sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm that
can propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensor
botnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return oriented
programming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details and
suggest some counter-measures.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0248v1,The merger-driven evolution of warm infrared luminous galaxies,"  We present a merger-driven evolutionary model for the production of luminous
(LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with warm IR colours. Our
results show that simulations of gas--rich major mergers including star
formation, black hole growth, and feedback can produce warm (U)LIRGs. We also
find that while the warm evolutionary phase is associated with increased AGN
activity, star formation alone may be sufficient to produce warm IR colours.
However, the transition can be suppressed entirely - even when there is a
significant AGN contribution - when we assume a single-phase ISM, which
maximizes the attenuation. Finally, our evolutionary models are consistent with
the 25-to-60 micron flux density ratio vs. L_HX/L_IR relation for local LIRGs
and ULIRGs, and predict the observed scatter in IR color at fixed L_HX/L_IR.
Therefore, our models suggest a cautionary note in the interpretation of warm
IR colours: while associated with periods of active black hole growth, they are
probably produced by a complex mix of star formation and AGN activity
intermediate between the cold star formation dominated phase and the birth of a
bright, unobscured quasar.

ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) in the Extended Growth Strip (EGS).
These objects were initially selected on the basis of their observed mid--IR
colours (0.0 < [3.6]-[4.5] < 0.4 and -0.7 < [3.6]-[8.0] < 0.5) to lie at high
redshift 1.5 < z < 3, and subsequent 20-38 micron mid-IR spectroscopy confirms
that they lie in a narrow redshift window centered on z=2. We detect 9/12 of
the objects in our sample at high significance (>3 sigma) with a mean
1200\micron flux of <F_1200> = 1.6+/-0.1 mJy. Our millimetre photometry,
combined with existing far-IR photometry from the Far-IR Deep Extragalactic
Legacy (FIDEL) Survey and accurate spectroscopic redshifts, places constraints
both sides of the thermal dust peak. This allows us to estimate the dust
properties, including the far--IR luminosity, dust temperature, and dust mass.
We find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ULIRGs,
and local systems, but has a different dust selection function than
submillimeter-selected galaxies. Finally, we use existing 20cm radio continuum
imaging to test the far-IR/radio correlation at high redshift. We find that our
sample is consistent with the local relation, implying little evolution.
Furthermore, this suggests that our sample selection method is efficient at
identifying ultraluminous, starburst--dominated systems within a very narrow

implications for their interaction history with the Milky Way (MW) and with
each other. The Clouds are likely on their first passage about the MW and the
SMC's orbit about the LMC is better described as quasi-periodic rather than
circular. Binary L/SMC orbits that satisfy observational constraints on their
mutual interaction history (e.g. the formation of the Magellanic Bridge during
a collision between the Clouds ~300 Myr ago) can be located within 1 sigma of
the mean PMs. However, these binary orbits are not co-located with the
Magellanic Stream (MS) when projected on the plane of the sky and the
line-of-sight velocity gradient along the LMC's orbit is significantly steeper
than that along the MS. These combined results ultimately rule out a purely
tidal origin for the MS: tides are ineffective without multiple pericentric
passages and can neither decrease the velocity gradient nor explain the offset
stream in a polar orbit configuration. Alternatively, ram pressure stripping of
an extended gaseous disk may naturally explain the deviation. The offset also
suggests that observations of the little-explored region between RA 21h and 23h

origin. We investigate the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in a small
region of a disk, which we model as a linear shear flow with Coriolis force,
between two parallel walls. Although there are no exponentially growing
eigenmodes in this system, because of the non-normal nature of the modes, it is
possible to have a large transient growth in the energy of certain
perturbations. For a constant angular momentum disk, the energy grows by more
than a factor of 1000 for a Reynolds number of only 1000, and so turbulence is
easily excited. For a Keplerian disk, the growth is more modest, and energy
growth by a factor of 1000 requires a Reynolds number of nearly a million.
Accretion disks have even larger Reynolds numbers than this. Therefore,
transient growth of perturbations could seed turbulence in such disks.

Effective Theory (HQET). One formulation of HQET was mostly developed at
Harvard and involves the use of the equation of motion to eliminate the small
components of the heavy quark field. The second formulation, developed in
Mainz, involves a series of Foldy-Wouthuysen-type field transformations which
diagonalizes the heavy quark Lagrangian. Starting at O($1/m_Q^2$) the two
formulations are different in that their effective Lagrangians, their effective
currents, and their fields differ. However, when these three differences are
properly taken into account, the two alternative formulations lead to identical
S-matrix elements. This is demonstrated in an explicit example at O($1/m_Q^2$).
We point to an essential difficulty of the Harvard HQET in that the Harvard
effective fields are not properly normalized starting at order $O(1/m_Q^2)$.

All CP violation arises from the vev of a CP-odd scalar field localized in the

In particular, for sub-critical inflaton speeds all distribution moments become

retaining a finite probability for finite values. Our analysis represents the
exact quantum treatment of the system at lowest order in the slow-roll

http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2662v1,On the stabilization of ion sputtered surfaces,"  The classical theory of ion beam sputtering predicts the instability of a
flat surface to uniform ion irradiation at any incidence angle. We relax the
assumption of the classical theory that the average surface erosion rate is
determined by a Gaussian response function representing the effect of the
collision cascade and consider the surface dynamics for other
physically-motivated response functions. We show that although instability of
flat surfaces at any beam angle results from all Gaussian and a wide class of
non-Gaussian erosive response functions, there exist classes of modifications
to the response that can have a dramatic effect. In contrast to the classical
theory, these types of response render the flat surface linearly stable, while
imperceptibly modifying the predicted sputter yield vs. incidence angle. We
discuss the possibility that such corrections underlie recent reports of a
``window of stability'' of ion-bombarded surfaces at a range of beam angles for
certain ion and surface types, and describe some characteristic aspects of
pattern evolution near the transition from unstable to stable dynamics. We
point out that careful analysis of the transition regime may provide valuable
tests for the consistency of any theory of pattern formation on ion sputtered
surfaces.

  SNR G1.9+0.3","  Type Ia supernovae, with their remarkably homogeneous light curves and
spectra, have been used as standardizable candles to measure the accelerating
expansion of the Universe. Yet, their progenitors remain elusive. Common
explanations invoke a degenerate star (white dwarf) which explodes upon
reaching close to the Chandrasekhar limit, by either steadily accreting mass
from a companion star or violently merging with another degenerate star. We
show that circumstellar interaction in young Galactic supernova remnants can be
used to distinguish between these single and double degenerate progenitor
scenarios. Here we propose a new diagnostic, the Surface Brightness Index,
which can be computed from theory and compared with Chandra and VLA
observations. We use this method to demonstrate that a double degenerate
progenitor can explain the decades-long flux rise and size increase of the
youngest known Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3. We disfavor a single degenerate scenario.
We attribute the observed properties to the interaction between a steep ejecta
profile and a constant density environment. We suggest using the upgraded VLA
to detect circumstellar interaction in the remnants of historical Type Ia
supernovae in the Local Group of galaxies. This may settle the long-standing
debate over their progenitors.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2399v2,(No) Eternal Inflation and Precision Higgs Physics,"  Even if nothing but a light Higgs is observed at the LHC, suggesting that the
Standard Model is unmodified up to scales far above the weak scale, Higgs
physics can yield surprises of fundamental significance for cosmology. As has
long been known, the Standard Model vacuum may be metastable for low enough
Higgs mass, but a specific value of the decay rate holds special significance:
for a very narrow window of parameters, our Universe has not yet decayed but
the current inflationary period can not be future eternal. Determining whether
we are in this window requires exquisite but achievable experimental precision,
with a measurement of the Higgs mass to 0.1 GeV at the LHC, the top mass to 60
MeV at a linear collider, as well as an improved determination of alpha_s by an
order of magnitude on the lattice. If the parameters are observed to lie in
this special range, particle physics will establish that the future of our
Universe is a global big crunch, without harboring pockets of eternal
inflation, strongly suggesting that eternal inflation is censored by the
fundamental theory. This conclusion could be drawn even more sharply if
metastability with the appropriate decay rate is found in the MSSM, where the
physics governing the instability can be directly probed at the TeV scale.

galaxy NGC 1365, we report here on the spectral and timing behaviour of two
ultraluminous X-ray sources, which had previously reached isotropic X-ray
luminosities L_X ~ 4 x 10^{40} erg/s (0.3-10 keV band). In 2007, they were in a
lower state (L_X ~ 5 x 10^{39} erg/s, and L_X ~ 1.5 x 10^{39} erg/s for X1 and
X2, respectively). Their X-ray spectra were dominated by power-laws with photon
indices Gamma ~ 1.8 and Gamma ~ 1.2, respectively. Thus, their spectra were
similar to those at their outburst peaks. Both sources have been seen to vary
by a factor of 20 in luminosity over the years, but their spectra are always
dominated by a hard power-law; unlike most stellar-mass BHs, they have never
been found in a canonical high/soft state dominated by a standard disk. The
lack of a canonical high/soft state seems to be a common feature of ULXs. We
speculate that the different kind of donor star and/or a persistently
super-Eddington accretion rate during their outbursts may prevent accretion
flows in ULXs from settling into steady standard disks.

generate the microwave haze seen at WMAP frequencies. In addition, the implied

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3020v2,The Kennicutt-Schmidt Star Formation Relation at z~2,"  Recent observations of excited CO emission lines from z~2 disc galaxies have
shed light on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at high-z via observed SFR-CO
(J=2-1) and (J=3-2) relations. Here, we describe a novel methodology for
utilising these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying
Schmidt (SFR-rho^N) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the
potential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily
star-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO
states than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-CO^alpha
index, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N.
Utilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line
radiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2
disc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed
SFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in
relatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,
resulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines. This means that an observed
(e.g.) SFR-CO (J=3-2) relation does not map linearly to SFR-H2 relation. We
utilise our model results to provide a mapping from alpha to N for the range of
Schmidt indices N=1-2. By comparing to recent observational surveys, we find
that the observed SFR-CO (J=2-1) and SFR-CO (J=3-2) relations suggest that an
underlying SFR rho^1.5 relation describes z~2 disc galaxies.

stream has been freely expanding away due to the tidal disruption of the
globular cluster. This timescale, in turn, places a lower limit on the age of
the cluster. The age can be deduced from astrometry using a modest number of
stars, with the error on this estimate depending on the proximity of the stream

  Implications for the Magnetic Field Topology","  We present multi-epoch radio and optical observations of the M7 dwarf 2MASS
J13142039+1320011. We detect a ~1 mJy source at 1.43, 4.86, 8.46 and 22.5 GHz,
making it the most luminous radio emission over the widest frequency range
detected from an ultracool dwarf to date. A 10 hr VLA observation reveals that
the radio emission varies sinusoidally with a period of 3.89+/-0.05 hr, and an
amplitude of ~30% at 4.86 GHz and ~20% at 8.46 GHz. The periodicity is also
seen in circular polarization, where at 4.86 GHz the polarization reverses
helicity from left- to right-handed in phase with the total intensity. An
archival detection in the FIRST survey indicates that the radio emission has
been stable for at least a decade. We also detect periodic photometric
variability in several optical filters with a period of 3.79 hr, and measure a
rotation velocity of vsini=45+/-5 km/s, in good agreement with the radio and
optical periods. The period and rotation velocity allow us to place a lower
limit on the radius of the source of >0.12 R_sun, about 30% larger than
theoretical expectations. The properties of the radio emission can be explained
with a simple model of a magnetic dipole mis-aligned relative to the stellar
rotation axis, with the sinusoidal variations and helicity reversal due to the
rotation of the magnetic poles relative to our line of sight. The long-term
stability of the radio emission indicates that the magnetic field (and hence
the dynamo) is stable on a much longer timescale than the convective turn-over
time of ~0.2 yr. If the radio emission is due to the electron cyclotron maser
process, the inferred magnetic field strength reaches at least 8 kG.

characterized by a roughness exponent approximately equal to 0.5, could be
caused by the generation, during local instabilities by depinning, of
diffusively broadened corrugation waves, which have recently been observed to
propagate elastically along moving crack fronts. We find that the theory agrees
plausibly with the orders of magnitude observed. Various consequences and
limitations, as well as alternative explanations, are discussed. We argue that
another mechanism, possibly related to damage cavity coalescence, is needed to
account for the observed large scale roughness of cracks that is characterized
by a roughness exponent approximately equal to 0.8

local spin is coupled to independent bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.
Applying a second order expansion in the anomalous dimension of the Bose field
we analyze the various non-trivial fixed points of this model. We show that
anisotropy in the couplings is relevant at the SU(2) invariant non Fermi liquid
fixed points studied earlier and thus the quantum phase transition is usually
governed by XY or Ising-type fixed points. We furthermore derive an exact
result that relates the anomalous exponent of the Bose field to that of the
susceptibility at any finite coupling fixed point. Implications on the
dynamical mean field approach to locally quantum critical phase transitions are
also discussed.

features of the distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore

a physically reasonable scenario in which, as in experiments, the polymer's
speed depends sensitively on its chemical composition, and even on its
orientation in the channel. Finally, we point out that the experimental
distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore is much broader

the laborious nature of making measurements one molecule at a time. We have
solved these issues with a new approach: massively parallel single-molecule

novel instrument that we call the Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), in which
objects in an orbiting sample are subjected to a calibration-free,

observed. We demonstrate high-throughput single-molecule force spectroscopy
with this technique by performing thousands of rupture experiments in parallel,
characterizing force-dependent unbinding kinetics of an antibody-antigen pair
in minutes rather than days. Additionally, we verify the force accuracy of the
instrument by measuring the well-established DNA overstretching transition at
66 $\pm$ 3 pN. With significant benefits in efficiency, cost, simplicity, and
versatility, ""single-molecule centrifugation"" has the potential to
revolutionize single-molecule experimentation, and open access to a wider range

characterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectral
energy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the

significant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07359v1,"Function-on-Function Regression for the Identification of Epigenetic
  Regions Exhibiting Windows of Susceptibility to Environmental Exposures","  The ability to identify time periods when individuals are most susceptible to
exposures, as well as the biological mechanisms through which these exposures
act, is of great public health interest. Growing evidence supports an
association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and epigenetic marks,
such as DNA methylation, but the timing and gene-specific effects of these
epigenetic changes are not well understood. Here, we present the first study
that aims to identify prenatal windows of susceptibility to air pollution
exposures in cord blood DNA methylation. In particular, we propose a
function-on-function regression model that leverages data from nearby DNA
methylation probes to identify epigenetic regions that exhibit windows of
susceptibility to ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 microns
(PM$_{2.5}$). By incorporating the covariance structure among both the
multivariate DNA methylation outcome and the time-varying exposure under study,
this framework yields greater power to detect windows of susceptibility and
greater control of false discoveries than methods that model probes
independently. We compare our method to a distributed lag model approach that
models DNA methylation in a probe-by-probe manner, both in simulation and by
application to motivating data from the Project Viva birth cohort. In two
epigenetic regions selected based on prior studies of air pollution effects on
epigenome-wide methylation, we identify windows of susceptibility to PM$_{2.5}$
exposure near the beginning and middle of the third trimester of pregnancy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5425v2,The impact of feedback on cosmological gas accretion,"  We investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time in
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations is modified by a comprehensive physical
model for baryonic feedback processes. To do so, we compare two simulations --
with and without feedback -- both evolved with the moving mesh code AREPO. The
feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation
project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback
from supermassive blackholes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material
contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the
intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as
well as the net, inflow of this ""smooth mode"" gas at all redshifts, regardless
of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the
temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z=2.
However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir
decreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the rates
of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this
boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total
accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of
two across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold
temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z<1. (d) The
amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy --
the ""halo transit time"" -- increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of
~2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible
implications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01614v1,"Efficacy of early stellar feedback in low gas surface density
  environments","  We present a suite of high resolution radiation hydrodynamic simulations of a
small patch ($1 \ {\rm kpc}^2$) of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) performed
with Arepo-RT, with the aim to quantify the efficacy of various feedback
processes like supernovae explosions (SNe), photoheating and radiation pressure
in low gas surface density galaxies ($\Sigma_{\rm gas} \simeq 10 \ {\rm
M}_\odot \ {\rm pc}^{-2}$). We show that radiation fields decrease the star
formation rate and therefore the total stellar mass formed by a factor of $\sim
2$. This increases the gas depletion timescale and brings the simulated
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation closer to the observational estimates. Radiation
feedback coupled with SNe is more efficient at driving outflows with the mass
and energy loading increasing by a factor of $\sim 10$. This increase is mainly
driven by the additional entrainment of medium density ($10^{-2} \leq n< 1 \
{\rm cm}^{-3}$), warm ($300 \ {\rm K}\leq T<8000 \ {\rm K}$) material.
Therefore including radiation fields tends to launch colder, denser and higher
mass and energy loaded outflows. This is because photoheating of the high
density gas around a newly formed star over-pressurises the region, causing it
to expand. This reduces the ambient density in which the SNe explode by a
factor of $10-100$ which in turn increases their momentum output by a factor of
$\sim 1.5-2.5$. Finally, we note that in these low gas surface density
environments, radiation fields primarily impact the ISM via photoheating and
radiation pressure has only a minimal role in regulating star formation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06167v3,Simulating the effect of photoheating feedback during reionization,"  We present self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic simulations of hydrogen
reionization performed with Arepo-RT complemented by a state-of-the-art galaxy
formation model. We examine how photoheating feedback, due to reionization,
shapes the galaxies properties. Our fiducial model completes reionization by
$z\approx6$ and matches observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the CMB electron
scattering optical depth, the high-redshift UV luminosity function, and stellar
mass function. Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star
formation rates by more than $50\%$ only in halos less massive than
$\sim10^{8.4}\ M_\odot$ ($\sim10^{8.8}\ M_\odot$) at $z=6$ $(z=5)$, suggesting
inefficient photoheating feedback from photons within galaxies. The use of a
uniform UV background that heats up the gas at $z\approx10.7$ generates an
earlier onset of suppression of star formation compared to our fiducial model.
This discrepancy can be mitigated by adopting a UV background model with a more
realistic reionization history. In the absence of stellar feedback,
photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than $\sim10^9\
M_\odot$ at $z\gtrsim5$, implying that photoheating feedback is sub-dominant in
regulating star formation. In addition, stellar feedback, implemented as a
non-local galactic wind scheme in the simulations, weakens the strength of
photoheating feedback by reducing the amount of stellar sources. Most
importantly, photoheating does not leave observable imprints in the UV
luminosity function, stellar mass function, or the cosmic star formation rate
density. The feasibility of using these observables to detect imprints of
reionization therefore requires further investigation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05379v1,Tuning the Exo-Space Weather Radio for Stellar Coronal Mass Ejections,"  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on stars other than the Sun have proven very
difficult to detect. One promising pathway lies in the detection of type II
radio bursts. Their appearance and distinctive properties are associated with
the development of an outward propagating CME-driven shock. However, dedicated
radio searches have not been able to identify these transient features in other
stars. Large Alfv\'en speeds and the magnetic suppression of CMEs in active
stars have been proposed to render stellar eruptions ""radio-quiet"". Employing
3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study here the distribution of the
coronal Alfv\'en speed, focusing on two cases representative of a young
Sun-like star and a mid-activity M-dwarf (Proxima Centauri). These results are
compared with a standard solar simulation and used to characterize the
shock-prone regions in the stellar corona and wind. Furthermore, using a
flux-rope eruption model, we drive realistic CME events within our M-dwarf
simulation. We consider eruptions with different energies to probe the regimes
of weak and partial CME magnetic confinement. While these CMEs are able to
generate shocks in the corona, those are pushed much farther out compared to
their solar counterparts. This drastically reduces the resulting type II radio
burst frequencies down to the ionospheric cutoff, which impedes their detection
with ground-based instrumentation.

sometimes decay into a charged (or neutral) scalar along with an

for the leptophobic gauge bosons at hadron colliders and provide an interesting

27 mag AB) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete HST CANDELS WFC3/IR
GOODS-N imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that are
known, just ~500 Myr after the Big Bang. Two similarly bright sources are also
detected in a systematic re-analysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four
galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deep
Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore,
the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at
3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a
slope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at
high redshift. The abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that the
luminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in L_* at z>~8
with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.
Despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formation
rate density for galaxies with SFR >0.7 M_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitude
increase in only 170 Myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previous
results. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,

and reveals the presence of a soft component below 2-3 keV. When combined with
non simultaneous RXTE/HEXTE data, we show that the ASCA spectrum can be
adequately fitted by a Comptonization model for which the electron temperature
is ~30 keV, the optical depth is ~3 for a spherical scattering cloud. The soft
component carries off about 13%, and 35% of the 0.1-200 keV luminosity for a

the accretion disk, whereas the hard Comptonized component is generated in a

soft spectrum, whereas for the lower luminosity state (down to ~5 10^36 ergs/s)
the spectrum is significantly harder. Using the high time resolution data

High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) in the persistent X-ray

structure in the N-S direction, which is less well determined than in the E-W

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405266v2,Direct Detection of Dark Matter with Space-based Laser Interferometers,"  Dark matter pervades the Solar System, free-streaming at the halo's local
Galactic orbital velocity and density. As these objects pass through the Solar
system, they perturb gravitationally, and thus very weakly, all nearby inertial
masses. Making use of this, we propose an approach to the direct detection of
dark matter at previously inaccessible intermediate masses (1e14 -- 1e20 gm).
Such mass scales are relevant for example for dark matter made of primordial
black holes or clumped matter in a sequestered sector. If such dark matter
exists it will be unambiguously detectable through its inelastic gravitational
interaction with the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
experiment. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by studying the dark
matter signal in numerical simulations of the LISA data stream. A more
conservative approach -- to detect dark matter in the differential acceleration
power spectrum -- significantly underestimates the expected rates for LISA.
Interestingly, while the space-density of 1e15 gm DM objects would be
comparable to the space-density of asteroids of similar masses, such ``light
matter'' contaminants are readily detectable in reflected Solar light, allowing
for the elimination of the major background.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507524v2,Characteristic Scales During Reionization,"  One of the key observables of the reionization era is the distribution of
neutral and ionized gas. Recently, Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, & Hernquist
developed a simple analytic model to describe the growth of HII regions during
this era. Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions
behind this model and generalise it in several important ways. The model
predicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size R_c
that ranges from R_c~1 Mpc in the early phases to R_c>10 Mpc in the late
phases. We show that R_c is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies
driving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental
property of the first galaxies. The variance around R_c, on the other hand, is
determined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that
increasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts R_c to
significantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations.
These differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21 cm surveys
(increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of two on
large scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background. Finally, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the
galaxy population only broaden the bubble size distribution significantly if
massive galaxies are responsible for most of the ionizing photons. We argue
that the key results of this model are robust to many of our uncertainties
about the reionization process.

graphitic structures and inversions of ab initio cohesive energy curves. The
interaction model includes two-body and three-body terms which depend on the

formulation is able to capture successfully: (i) the energetics and elastic
properties of the ground state diamond lattice; (ii) the covalent
re-hybridization of undercoordinated atoms; (iii) and a smooth transition to
metallic bonding for overcoordinated atoms. Because the essential features of
chemical bonding in the bulk are built into the functional form, this model
promises to be useful for describing interatomic forces in silicon bulk phases
and defects. Although this functional form is remarkably realistic by usual
standards, it contains a small number of fitting parameters and requires
computational effort comparable to the most efficient existing models. In a
companion paper, a complete parameterization of the model is given, and
excellent performance for condensed phases and bulk defects is demonstrated.

one-dimensional (1d) periodic potential as, for example, realized in recent
experiments on 2d colloids subjected to two interfering laser beams. The
topology of the phase diagram is found to depend primarily on two factors: the
relative orientation of the 2d crystal and the periodic potential troughs,
which select a set of Bragg planes running parallel to the troughs, and the
commensurability ratio p= a'/d of the spacing a' between these Bragg planes to
the period d of the periodic potential. The complexity of the phase diagram
increases with the magnitude of the commensurabilty ratio p. Rich phase
diagram, with ``modulated liquid'', ``floating'' and ``locked floating'' solid
and smectic phases are found. Phase transitions between these phases fall into
two broad universality classes, roughening and melting, driven by the
proliferation of discommensuration walls and dislocations, respectively. We
discuss correlation functions and the static structure factor in these phases
and make detailed predictions of the universal features close to the phase
boundaries. We predict that for charged systems with highly screened
short-range interactions these melting transitions are generically reentrant as
a function of the strength of the periodic potential, prediction that is in
accord with recent 2d colloid experiments. Implications of our results for
future experiments are also discussed.

scattering (DS) measurements from the surface of liquid Indium close to its

surface. We present a model to describe DS that takes into account the surface
structure factor, thermally excited capillary waves and the experimental
resolution. The experimentally determined DS follows this model with no
adjustable parameters, allowing the surface structure factor to be deconvolved
from the thermally excited height fluctuations. The resulting local electron
density profile displays exponentially decaying surface induced layering
similar to that previously reported for Ga and Hg. We compare the details of
the local electron density profiles of liquid In, which is a nearly free
electron metal, and liquid Ga, which is considerably more covalent and shows
directional bonding in the melt. The oscillatory density profiles have
comparable amplitudes in both metals, but surface layering decays over a length

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0607270v1,"Coevolutionary dynamics in large, but finite populations","  Coevolving and competing species or game-theoretic strategies exhibit rich
and complex dynamics for which a general theoretical framework based on finite
populations is still lacking. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in
the form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent
selection with two strategies in finite populations based on microscopic
processes [A.Traulsen, J.C. Claussen, and C.Hauert, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 238701
(2005)]. Here we generalize this approach in a twofold way: First, we extend
the framework to an arbitrary number of strategies and second, we allow for
mutations in the evolutionary process. The deterministic limit of infinite
population size of the frequency dependent Moran process yields the adjusted
replicator-mutator equation, which describes the combined effect of selection
and mutation. For finite populations, we provide an extension taking random
drift into account. In the limit of neutral selection, i.e. whenever the
process is determined by random drift and mutations, the stationary strategy
distribution is derived. This distribution forms the background for the
coevolutionary process. In particular, a critical mutation rate $u_c$ is
obtained separating two scenarios: above $u_c$ the population predominantly
consists of a mixture of strategies whereas below $u_c$ the population tends to
be in homogenous states. For one of the fundamental problems in evolutionary
biology, the evolution of cooperation under Darwinian selection, we demonstrate
that the analytical framework provides excellent approximations to individual
based simulations even for rather small population sizes. This approach
complements simulation results and provides a deeper, systematic understanding
of coevolutionary dynamics.

http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0411039v1,Emergence of Complex Dynamics in a Simple Model of Signaling Networks,"  A variety of physical, social and biological systems generate complex
fluctuations with correlations across multiple time scales. In physiologic
systems, these long-range correlations are altered with disease and aging. Such
correlated fluctuations in living systems have been attributed to the
interaction of multiple control systems; however, the mechanisms underlying
this behavior remain unknown. Here, we show that a number of distinct classes
of dynamical behaviors, including correlated fluctuations characterized by
$1/f$-scaling of their power spectra, can emerge in networks of simple
signaling units. We find that under general conditions, complex dynamics can be
generated by systems fulfilling two requirements: i) a ``small-world'' topology
and ii) the presence of noise. Our findings support two notable conclusions:
first, complex physiologic-like signals can be modeled with a minimal set of
components; and second, systems fulfilling conditions (i) and (ii) are robust
to some degree of degradation, i.e., they will still be able to generate
$1/f$-dynamics.

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311092v3,Stationary pulses of light in an atomic medium,"  Physical processes that could facilitate coherent control of light
propagation are now actively explored. In addition to fundamental interest,
these efforts are stimulated by possibilities to develop, for example, a
quantum memory for photonic states. At the same time, controlled localization
and storage of photonic pulses may allow novel approaches to manipulate light
via enhanced nonlinear optical processes. Recently, Electromagnetically Induced
Transparency (EIT) was used to reduce the group velocity of propagating light
pulses and to reversibly map propagating light pulses into stationary spin
excitations in atomic media. Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a
novel technique in which light propagating in a medium of Rb atoms is converted
into an excitation with localized, stationary electromagnetic energy, which can
be held and released after a controllable interval. Our method creates pulses
of light with stationary envelopes bound to an atomic spin coherence, raising

  Lyman Break Galaxy at z = 4.42","  We present the rest-frame ultraviolet through near infrared spectral energy
distribution for an interacting Lyman break galaxy at a redshift z=4.42, the
highest redshift merging system known with clearly resolved tidal features. The
two objects in this system - HDF-G4 and its previously unidentified companion -
are both B_{435} band dropouts, have similar V_{606}-i_{775} and
i_{775}-z_{850} colors, and are separated by 1"", which at z=4.42 corresponds to
7 kpc projected nuclear separation; all indicative of an interacting system.
Fits to stellar population models indicate a stellar mass of M_\star =
2.6\times 10^{10} M_\odot, age of \tau_\star = 720 My, and exponential star
formation history with an e-folding time \tau_0 = 440 My. Using these derived
stellar populations as constraints, we model the HDF-G4 system using
hydrodynamical simulations, and find that it will likely evolve into a quasar
by z\sim3.5, and a quiescent, compact spheroid by z\sim 2.5 similar to those
observed at z > 2. And, the existence of such an object supports galaxy
formation models in which major mergers drive the high redshift buildup of
spheroids and black holes.

  Strong Lenses","  Spectroscopic galaxy-galaxy lens searches are presently the most prolific
method of identifying strong lens systems in large data sets. We study the
probabilities associated with these lens searches, namely the probability of
identifying a candidate with rogue [OII] emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum,
and the probability that the candidate will show features of strong lensing in
follow-up photometric observations. We include selection effects unique to
spectroscopic data, and apply them to the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey (Bolton
et al. 2006). The most significant selection effect is the finite size of the
spectroscopic fiber which selects against large separation lenses and results
in a non-monotonic dependence of the rogue line probability on velocity
dispersion. For example, with the 3 arcsec diameter SDSS fiber and 2 arcsec
FWHM seeing, we find that the probability that a given LRG has a rogue [OII]
line in its spectrum decreases with velocity dispersion from 150 km/s to 300
km/s and then increases up to 400 km/s for a given source size. The total
probability for observing a rogue line in a single survey spectrum is
~0.9-3.0%, and the total lensing rate is ~0.5-1.3%. The range is due to
uncertainties in the physical size of [OII] emission regions, and in the
evolution of the [OII] luminosity function. Our estimates are a factor of ~5
higher than the results of the SLACS survey, a discrepancy which we attribute
to the SLACS requirement that multiple rogue lines be observed simultaneously.

low mass X-ray binary 4U 2129+47 (V1727 Cyg) shows a spectrum consistent with a
late F-type subgiant and no radial velocity variations on the 5.24 hour binary
period. This could imply that V1727 Cyg is a chance line of sight interloper.
Radial velocity measurements, however, showed evidence for a longer term ~40
km/s shift, which suggested that 4U 2129+47 could be a hierarchical triple
system, with the F-type star in a wide orbit about the inner low mass X-ray
binary. Aims. In order to confirm the long-term radial velocity shift reported
in Garcia et al. (1989) and its amplitude, we obtained spectroscopic
observations of V1727 Cyg during 1996 and 1998 with the William Herschel
Telescope using the ISIS spectrograph. Methods. We determined radial velocities
from the ISIS spectra by means of the cross-correlation technique with a
template spectrum. Results. The resulting radial velocities show variations
with a maximum amplitude of ~40 km/s, confirming previous results and

http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1040v1,Constraining Spinning Dust Parameters with the WMAP Five-Year Data,"  We characterize spinning dust emission in the warm ionized medium by
comparing templates of Galactic dust and Halpha with the 5-year maps from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. The Halpha-correlated microwave emission
deviates from the thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free) spectrum expected for
ionized gas, exhibiting an additional broad bump peaked at ~40 GHz which
provides ~20% of the peak intensity. We confirm that the bump is consistent
with a modified Draine & Lazarian (1998) spinning dust model, though the peak
frequency of the emission is somewhat lower than the 50 GHz previously claimed.
This frequency shift results from systematic errors in the large-scale modes of
the 3-year WMAP data which have been corrected in the 5-year data release. We
show that the bump is not the result of errors in the Halpha template by
analyzing regions of high free-free intensity, where the WMAP K-band map may be
used as the free-free template. We rule out a pure free-free spectrum for the
Halpha-correlated emission at high confidence: ~27sigma for the nearly full-sky
fit, even after marginalizing over the CMB cross-correlation bias. We also
extend the previous analysis by searching the parameter space of the Draine &
Lazarian model but letting the amplitude float. The best fit for reasonable
values of the characteristic electric dipole moment and density requires an
amplitude factor of ~0.3. This suggests that small PAHs in the warm ionized
medium are depleted by a factor of ~3.

the astronomical plate archives at Harvard College Observatory and Sonneberg
Observatory. We found that an eruption of V2487 Oph (Nova Oph 1998) occurred on
1900 June 20. V2487 Oph was previously classified as a classical nova, which we
identified as a probable recurrent nova based on its large expansion velocities
and the presence of high excitation lines in the outburst spectrum. The event
was recorded on Harvard plate AM 505, at a B magnitude of 10.27 +/- 0.11, which
is near peak. The outburst can only be seen on one plate, but the image has a
characteristic dumbbell shape (caused by a double exposure) that is identical
to the other star images on the plate, and thus is not a plate defect. We
conclude that this is in fact a previously-undiscovered nova outburst of V2487
Oph, confirming our prediction that it is a recurrent nova. We also examine the
discovery efficiency for eruptions of the system and conclude that a
randomly-timed outburst has, on average, a 30% chance of being discovered in
the past century. Using this, we deduce a recurrence time for V2487 Oph of
approximately 18 years, which implies that the next eruption is expected around
2016.

binary 2MASS J13153094-2649513AB made with the Australian Telescope Compact
Array. Observations at 5.5 GHz reveal an unresolved source with a continuum
flux of 370+/-50 microJy, corresponding to a radio luminosity of L_rad = nuL_nu

made at 9.0 GHz to a 5 sigma limit of 290 microJy, consistent with a power law
spectrum S_nu ~ nu^-a with a > 0.5. The emission is quiescent, with no evidence
of variability or bursts over 3 hr of observation, and no measurable
polarization (V/I < 34%). 2MASS J1315-2649AB is one of the most radio-luminous
ultracool dwarfs detected in quiescent emission to date, comparable in strength
to other cool sources detected in outburst. Its detection indicates no decline
in radio flux through the mid-L dwarfs. It is unique among L dwarfs in having
strong and persistent Halpha and radio emission, indicating the coexistence of
a cool, neutral photosphere (low electron density) and a highly active
chromosphere (high electron density and active heating). These traits, coupled
with the system's mature age and substellar secondary, makes 2MASS J1315-2649AB
an important test for proposed radio emission mechanisms in ultracool dwarfs.

J2030.5+4751 (SAO 49725), the latter two objects being similar to gamma Cas.
The star associated with Cyg X-1 does not show evidence for variability with an
amplitude higher than 0.3 magnitude over a hundred years. We found significant
variability of one magnitude with timescales of more than 10 years for SAO
49725, as well as a possible period of 500-600 days and an amplitude of 0.05
magnitude that might be the orbital, or super-orbital period of the system. The
data is insufficient to conclude for HD 161103 but suggests a similar long-term
variability. We thus observe an additional characteristic of gamma Cas-like
objects: their long-term variability. This variability seems to be due to the
slow evolution of a decretion disk around the Be star, but may be triggered by
the presence of a compact object in the system, possibly a white dwarf. This
characteristic could be used to identify further similar objects otherwise
difficult to detect.

orthogonality between the Lorentz force and $\mathbf{B}$. The possibility of
performing CT on a moving mesh provides several advantages over static mesh
methods due to the quasi-Lagrangian nature of the former (i.e., the mesh
generating points move with the flow), such as making the simulation
automatically adaptive and significantly reducing advection errors. Our method
preserves magnetic fields and fluid quantities in pure advection exactly.

0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,
KIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because
nearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is
unprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve
provides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light
curve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and
the day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for
unique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects
are very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not
appear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must
be some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of
dust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7
times as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the

  Mechanism","  Recent X-ray observations of merger shocks in galaxy clusters have shown that
the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons hotter than the
electrons. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study
the physics of electron irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number
shocks, for a representative case with sonic Mach number of 3 and plasma beta
of 16. We find that two basic ingredients are needed for electron entropy
production: (i) an electron temperature anisotropy, induced by field
amplification coupled to adiabatic invariance; and (ii) a mechanism to break
the electron adiabatic invariance itself. In shocks, field amplification occurs
at two major sites: at the shock ramp, where density compression leads to an
increase of the frozen-in field; and farther downstream, where the shock-driven
proton temperature anisotropy generates strong proton cyclotron and mirror
modes. The electron temperature anisotropy induced by field amplification
exceeds the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of
whistler waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for
efficient entropy production. We find that the electron heating efficiency
displays only a weak dependence on mass ratio (less than 30 percent drop, as we
increase the mass ratio from 49 up to 1600). We develop an analytical model of
electron irreversible heating and show that it is in excellent agreement with

kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows.
Various extensions to time series data are discussed. The approach is

learning (ML) systems can fail because of adversarial attacks on the algorithms
and data; this number balloons if we were to incorporate papers covering
non-adversarial failure modes. The spate of papers has made it difficult for ML
practitioners, let alone engineers, lawyers, and policymakers, to keep up with
the attacks against and defenses of ML systems. However, as these systems
become more pervasive, the need to understand how they fail, whether by the
hand of an adversary or due to the inherent design of a system, will only
become more pressing. In order to equip software developers, security incident
responders, lawyers, and policy makers with a common vernacular to talk about
this problem, we developed a framework to classify failures into ""Intentional
failures"" where the failure is caused by an active adversary attempting to
subvert the system to attain her goals; and ""Unintentional failures"" where the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12314v1,(Simulating) Coronal Mass Ejections in Active Stars,"  The stellar magnetic field completely dominates the environment around
late-type stars. It is responsible for driving the coronal high-energy
radiation (e.g. EUV/X-rays), the development of stellar winds, and the
generation transient events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
While progress has been made for the first two processes, our understanding of
the eruptive behavior in late-type stars is still very limited. One example of
this is the fact that despite the frequent and highly energetic flaring
observed in active stars, direct evidence for stellar CMEs is almost
non-existent. Here we discuss realistic 3D simulations of stellar CMEs,
analyzing their resulting properties in contrast with solar eruptions, and use
them to provide a common framework to interpret the available stellar
observations. Additionally, we present results from the first 3D CME
simulations in M-dwarf stars, with emphasis on possible observable signatures
imprinted in the stellar corona.

COVID-19 outbreak on female and male academics' research productivity in social
science. The lockdown has caused substantial disruptions to academic
activities, requiring people to work from home. How this disruption affects
productivity and the related gender equity is an important operations and
societal question. We collect data from the largest open-access preprint
repository for social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines
produced by 76,832 authors across 25 countries over a span of two years. We use
a difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock.
Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United
States, although the total research productivity increased by 35%, female
academics' productivity dropped by 13.9% relative to that of male academics. We
also show that several disciplines drive such gender inequality. Finally, we
find that this intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for academics in
top-ranked universities, and the effect exists in six other countries. Our work
points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding
that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It
also helps organizations realize the potential unintended consequences that can
arise from telecommuting.

  Lacertae: future eclipses","  Eclipses in the 14.4-day period double-lined binary SS Lac were observed
photographically and visually early in the 20th century, but stopped some 50 or
60 years ago. This has been explained by the presence of a distant third star
in the system, which has now been detected spectroscopically with a period of
679 days. The plane of the orbit of the binary is changing relative to the line
of sight in response to perturbations from this third object. A recent analysis
by Milone et al. (M00) of all photometric material available for the system,
including a re-measurement of original Harvard plates, has confirmed earlier
reports of changes in the depth of the eclipses as a function of time, which
are due to the third star. In this paper we discuss our detailed analysis of
the eclipse amplitude measurements, and extract from them information on the
change in the inclination angle of the binary over the last century. Our use of
a much improved ephemeris for the system by Torres & Stefanik was found to be
crucial, and prompted us to re-determine all the amplitudes from the historical
data at our disposal, including the Harvard material used by M00.
Systematically lower measurements on the branches of the minima were properly
accounted for, and we made use of both a linear approximation to the time
variation of the inclination angle and a more realistic model based on the
theory of three-body interactions (""regression of the nodes"" effect). The nodal

each lasting about 100 yr. The non-eclipsing status of the system is expected

  young star clusters in NGC 7252","  We have extended the study of the young star clusters observed in the merger
remnant galaxy NGC 7252 by obtaining K band photometry for these clusters. Our
K band data significantly complement the optical photometry and spectroscopy in
the literature: K band data are fundamental to study the Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) population of these clusters, since the AGB phase transition
(occuring between the age of 200 Myr and 1 Gyr) causes abrupt changes in the
near-infrared luminosity of the clusters while producing only small changes in
the optical. Therefore, the e.g. V-K colour is ideal to study this evolutionary
phase of stellar populations. For the present analysis we present models for
Simple Stellar Populations which include the contribution of the AGB stellar
phase, calibrated with the young and intermediate age star clusters of the
Magellanic Clouds. The comparison with the colour distribution of the NGC 7252
star clusters shows that they are indeed intermediate age clusters undergoing
the AGB phase transition. The AGB phase transition is observed for the first
time outside the Local Group. Most of the studied clusters span the very narrow
age range 300-500 Myr, and likely have metallicities 0.5-1 Z_{\odot}. A very
important exception is the cluster W32, which has already completed its AGB
epoch, its colours being consistent with an age of 1-2 Gyr. This impacts on the
duration of the merger-induced starburst. The strengths of the magnesium and
iron lines in the spectrum of the best observed cluster W3, and in the spectrum
of the diffuse central light of NGC 7252, do not show an overabundance in

keV) survey each 95min orbit. With a sensitivity (5sigma, 1yr) of ~0.05mCrab
(10-150 keV), it will extend the ROSAT soft x-ray (0.5-2.5keV) and proposed
ROSITA medium x-ray (2-10 keV) surveys into the hard x-ray band and enable
identification and study of sources ~10-20X fainter than with the ~15-100keV
survey planned for the upcoming Swift mission. At ~100-600 keV, the ~1mCrab
sensitivity is 300X that achieved in the only previous (HEAO-A4, non-imaging)
all-sky survey. EXIST will address a broad range of key science objectives:
from obscured AGN and surveys for black holes on all scales, which constrain
the accretion history of the universe, to the highest sensitivity and
resolution studies of gamma-ray bursts it will conduct as the Next Generation

enclosed the detectors in the same 40deg field-of-view collimator (comprisinga

  Globular Clusters","  Quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs) containing neutron stars have been
identified in several globular clusters using Chandra or XMM X-ray
observations, using their soft thermal spectra. We report a complete census of
the qLMXB population in these clusters, identifying three additional probable
qLMXBs in NGC 6440. We conduct several analyses of the qLMXB population, and
compare it with the harder, primarily CV, population of low-luminosity X-ray
sources with 10^31<L_X<10^32.5 ergs/s. The radial distribution of our qLMXB
sample suggests an average system mass of 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2} Msun, consistent
with a neutron star and low-mass companion. Spectral analysis reveals that no
globular cluster qLMXBs, other than the transient in NGC 6440, require an
additional hard power-law component as often observed in field qLMXBs. We
identify an empirical lower luminosity limit of 10^32 ergs/s among globular
cluster qLMXBs. The bolometric luminosity range of qLMXBs implies (in the deep
crustal heating model of Brown and collaborators) low time-averaged mass
transfer rates, below the disk stability criterion. The X-ray luminosity
functions of the CV populations alone in NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc are shown to
differ. The distribution of qLMXBs among globular clusters is consistent with
their dynamical formation by either tidal capture or exchange encounters,
allowing us to estimate that seven times more qLMXBs than bright LMXBs reside
in globular clusters. The distribution of harder sources (primarily CVs) has a
weaker dependence upon density than that of the qLMXBs. Finally, we discuss
possible effects of core collapse and globular cluster destruction upon X-ray
source populations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408413v2,Towards a More Standardized Candle Using GRB Energetics and Spectra,"  The use of GRB energetics for cosmography has long been advanced as a means
to probe out to high redshifts, to the epoch of deceleration. However, the
prompt energy release in GRBs, even when corrected for jetting geometry, is far
from being a standard candle. We explore the cosmographic potential of a GRB
standard candle based on the newly-discovered relation by Ghirlanda et al.
between the apparent geometry-corrected energies (E_gamma) and the peak of the
prompt burst spectrum (E_p). We present an explicit, self-consistent formalism
for correcting GRB energies with a thorough accounting for observational
uncertainties. In contrast to other work, we demonstrate that the current
sample of 19 GRBs is not yet cosmographically competitive with results from
other studies (e.g., SNe Ia). Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a
significant correlation across a range of cosmologies, the goodness of fit of
the data to a power law, depends strongly on input assumptions -- especially
the unknown density of the circumburst medium. Independent of assumptions, with
very few low-z bursts, the current sample is most sensitive to Omega_M but
essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda. The proper use of the relation clearly
brings GRBs an impressive step closer toward a standardizable candle, but until
the physical origin of the E_p-E_gamma relation is understood, calibrated with
a training set of low redshift bursts, and the major potential systematic
uncertainties and selection effects are addressed, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography (abridged).

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502559v2,Present and Future Prospects for GRB Standard Candles,"  Following our previous work, we conclude that a GRB standard candle
constructed from the Ghirlanda et al. power-law relation between the
geometry-corrected energy (E_gamma) and the peak of the rest-frame prompt burst
spectrum (E_p) is not yet cosmographically useful, despite holding some
potential advantages over SNe Ia. This is due largely to the small sample of
\~20 GRBs with the required measured redshifts, jet-breaks, and peak energies,
and to the strong sensitivity of the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to input
assumptions. The most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to the
generally unknown density (and density profile), of the circumburst medium.
Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a highly significant correlation over many
cosmologies, until the sample expands to include many low-z events, it will be
most sensitive to Omega_M but essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda and w,
with some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z GRB data alone. The relation
clearly represents a significant improvement in the search for an empirical GRB
standard candle, but is further hindered by an unknown physical basis for the
relation, the lack of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in a
cosmology-independent way, and several major potential systematic uncertainties
and selection effects. Until these concerns are addressed, a larger sample is
acquired, and attempts are made to marginalize or perform Monte Carlo
simulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography and especially the attempts to
combine GRBs with SNe Ia.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507266v2,The Effects of Reionization on Lyman-alpha Galaxy Surveys,"  Searches for Lyman-alpha emission lines are among the most effective ways to
identify high-redshift galaxies. They are particularly interesting because they
probe not only the galaxies themselves but also the ionization state of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). The observed line strengths depend on the amount by
which each photon is able to redshift away from line center before encountering
neutral gas and hence on the size distribution of HII regions surrounding the
sources. Here, we use an analytic model of that size distribution to study the
effects of reionization on the luminosity function of Lyman-alpha emitters and
their observed spatial distribution. Our model includes the clustering of
high-redshift galaxies and thus contains ionized bubbles much larger than those
expected around isolated galaxies. As a result, Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies
remain visible earlier in reionization: we expect the number counts to decline
by only a factor ~2 (or 10) when the mean ionized fraction falls to x_i~0.75
(or 0.5) in the simplest model. Moreover, the absorption is not uniform across
the sky: galaxies remain visible only if they sit inside large bubbles, which
become increasingly rare as x_i decreases. Thus, the size distribution also
affects the apparent clustering of Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. On large
scales, it traces that of the large bubbles, which in our model are more biased
than the galaxies. On small scales, the clustering increases rapidly as x_i
decreases because large HII regions surround strong galaxy overdensities, so a
survey automatically selects only those galaxies with neighbours. The
transition between these two regimes occurs at the characteristic bubble size.
Hence, large Lyman-alpha galaxy surveys have the potential to measure directly
the size distribution of HII regions during reionization.

past several years, and we have already shown that the observed properties of
Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z=3 can be explained well by the massive
galaxies in the simulations. Here we extend our study to z=6 and show that we
obtain good agreement for the LBGs at the bright-end of the luminosity function
(LF). Our simulations also suggest that the cosmic star formation rate density
has a peak at z= 5-6, and that the current LBG surveys at z=6 are missing a
significant number of faint galaxies that are dimmer than the current magnitude
limit. Together, our results suggest that the universe could be reionized at
z=6 by the Pop II stars in ordinary galaxies. We also estimate the LF of
Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z=6 by relating the star formation rate in the
simulation to the Ly-alpha luminosity. We find that the simulated LAE LFs agree
with the observed data provided that the net escape fraction of Ly-alpha photon
is f_{Ly-alpha} <= 0.1. We investigate two possible scenarios for this effect:
(1) all sources in the simulation are uniformly dimmer by a factor of 10
through attenuation, and (2) one out of ten LAEs randomly lights up at a given
moment. We show that the correlation strength of the LAE spatial distribution

dominated by the more numerous small events. The exponent of a power law
distribution can be determined with good accuracy by rank-ordering statistics
from the observation of only a few tens of the largest events. Using analytical
results and synthetic tests, we quantify the systematic and the random errors.
  We also study the case of a distribution defined by two branches, each having
a power law distribution, one defined for the largest events and the other for
smaller events, with application to the World-Wide (Harvard) and Southern
California earthquake catalogs. In the case of the Harvard moment catalog, we
make more precise earlier claims of the existence of a transition of the
earthquake magnitude distribution between small and large earthquakes; the
$b$-values are $b_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$ for large shallow earthquakes and $b_1 =
1.00 \pm 0.02$ for smaller shallow earthquakes. However, the cross-over
magnitude between the two distributions is ill-defined. The data available at
present do not provide a strong constraint on the cross-over which has a $50\%$
probability of being between magnitudes $7.1$ and $7.6$ for shallow
earthquakes; this interval may be too conservatively estimated. Thus, any
influence of a universal geometry of rupture on the distribution of earthquakes
world-wide is ill-defined at best. We caution that there is no direct evidence
to confirm the hypothesis that the large-moment branch is indeed a power law.
In fact, a gamma distribution fits the entire suite of earthquake moments from
the smallest to the largest satisfactorily. There is no evidence that the

distribution of earthquake magnitudes: the quantile QT(q) of a high probability
level q for the T-maxima, and the probability of exceedence for a high
threshold magnitude. We obtained the following sample estimates for the global
Harvard catalog: QT(q=0.98)=8.6 +- 0.2 and a probability for the T-maxima to
exceed magnitude 8 equal to 0.13-0.20. The comparison between our estimates for
the two periods 1977-2004 and 1977-2006, where the later period includes the
great Sumatra earthquake, 24.12.2004, mW=9.0, confirms the instability of the
estimation of the parameter Mmax and the stability of the two other estimates.

supernova remnants: SNR 1E102.2-7219 (E0102) in the SMC, Cas A and G11.2-0.3 in

of dust features which include 21 micron-peak dust and featureless dust in Cas
A and 18-micron peak dust in E0102 and N132D. The 18 micron-peak feature is
fitted by a mix of MgSiO$_3$ and solid Si dust grains, while the 21-micron peak
dust is by a mix of silicates and FeO; we also explore dust fitting using
Continuous Distribution of Ellipsoid grain models. We report detection of CO
fundamental band from Cas A in near-infrared. We review dust features observed
and identified in other SNRs. The dust emission is spatially correlated with
the ejecta emission, showing dust is formed in SN ejecta. The spectra of E0102
show rich gas lines from ejecta including strong ejecta lines of Ne and O,
including two [Ne III] lines and two [Ne V] lines which allow us to diagnostic
density and temperature of the ejecta and measure the ejecta masses. E0102 and
N132D show weak or lacking Ar, Si, and Fe ejecta, whereas the young Galactic
SNR Cas A show strong Ar, Si, and S and weak Fe. We discuss compositions and
masses of dust and association with those of ejecta and finally, dust
contribution from SNe to early Universe.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0966v2,"Simulations of Magnetized Disks Around Black Holes: Effects of Black
  Hole Spin, Disk Thickness, and Magnetic Field Geometry","  The standard general relativistic model of a razor-thin accretion disk around
a black hole, developed by Novikov & Thorne (NT) in 1973, assumes the shear
stress vanishes at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and
that, outside the ISCO, the shear stress is produced by an effective turbulent
viscosity. However, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it is
uncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the ISCO, and the
magnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may contain
large-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity.
We describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spin
parameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the NT model.
Our fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity)
poloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order to
match the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane. For a thin disk
with an aspect ratio |h/r| ~ 0.07 around a non-spinning black hole, we find a
decrease in the accreted specific angular momentum of 2.9% relative to the NT
model and an excess luminosity from inside the ISCO of 3.5%. The deviations in
the case of spinning black holes are of the same order. In addition, the
deviations decrease with decreasing |h/r|. We therefore conclude that
magnetized thin accretion disks in x-ray binaries in the thermal/high-soft
spectral state ought to be well-described by the NT model, especially at
luminosities below 30% of Eddington where we expect a very small disk thickness
|h/r| <~ 0.05. We also discuss how the stress and the luminosity inside the
ISCO depend on the assumed initial magnetic field geometry. (abridged)

  Comparison","  We study the rotational properties of magnetized and self-gravitating
molecular cloud cores formed in 2 very high resolution 3D molecular cloud
simulations.The simulations have been performed using the code RAMSES at an
effective resolution of 4096^3.One simulation represents a mildly
magnetically-supercritical cloud and the other a strongly
magnetically-supercritical cloud.A noticeable difference between the 2
simulations is the core formation efficiency (CFE) of the high density cores.In
the strongly supercritical simulations the CFE is ~33 % per free-fall time of
the cloud tff,cl, whereas in the mildly supercritical simulations this value
goes down to ~6%/tff,cl. A comparison of the intrinsic specific angular
momentum j3D distributions of the cores with the distribitions of j2D derived
using synthetic 2D velocity maps of the cores,shows that the synthetic
observations tend to overestimate the true value of j by a factor of ~10.The
origin of this discrepancy lies in the fact that contrary to the intrinsic
determination which sums up the individual gas parcels contributions to j, the
determination of j using the observational procedure which is based on a
measurement on the global velocity gradient under the hypothesis of uniform
rotation smoothes out the complex fluctuations present in the 3D velocity
field. Our results provide a natural explanation for the discrepancy by a
factor ~10 observed between the intrinsic 3D distributions of j and the
corresponding distributions derived in real observations.We suggest that
measurements of j which are based on the measurement of the observed global
velocity gradients may need to be reduced by a factor of ~10 in order to derive
a more accurate estimate of j in the cores.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1385v1,The Spitzer High Redshift Radio Galaxy Survey,"  We present results from a comprehensive imaging survey of 70 radio galaxies
at redshifts 1<z<5.2 using all three cameras onboard the Spitzer Space
Telescope. The resulting spectral energy distributions unambiguously show a
stellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with the
active nucleus in 59. Using a new restframe S_3um/S_1.6um versus S_um/S_3um
criterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from the
stellar population can be measured. For these radio galaxies, the median
stellar mass is high, 2x10^11 M_sun, and remarkably constant within the range
1<z<3. At z>3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease in
stellar mass. This suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk of
their stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition of
stellar and AGN emission is needed.
  The restframe 500 MHz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated with
stellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dust
luminosity. This suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range of
Eddington ratios. We also present new Very Large Array 4.86 and 8.46 GHz
imaging of 14 radio galaxies and find that radio core dominance --- an
indicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dust
luminosity. While all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2
AGNs, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependent
models if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type
2 to unobscured type 1 AGNs rather than a clear dichotomy. Finally, four radio
galaxies have nearby (<6"") companions whose mid-IR colors are suggestive of
their being AGNs. This may indicate an association between radio galaxy
activity and major mergers.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0415v1,The Radio Activity-Rotation Relation of Ultracool Dwarfs,"  [Abridged] We present a new radio survey of about 100 late-M and L dwarfs
undertaken with the VLA. The sample was chosen to explore the role of rotation
in the radio activity of ultracool dwarfs. Combining the new sample with
results from our previous studies and from the literature, we compile the
largest sample to date of ultracool dwarfs with radio observations and measured
rotation velocities (167 objects). In the spectral type range M0-M6 we find a
radio activity-rotation relation, with saturation at log(L_rad/L_bol) 10^(-7.5)
above vsini~5 km/s, similar to the relation in H-alpha and X-rays. However, at
spectral types >M7 the ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity increases
regardless of rotation velocity, and the scatter in radio luminosity increases.
In particular, while the most rapid rotators (vsini>20 km/s) exhibit
""super-saturation"" in X-rays and H-alpha, this effect is not seen in the radio.
We also find that ultracool dwarfs with vsini>20 km/s have a higher radio
detection fraction by about a factor of 3 compared to objects with vsini<10
km/s. When measured in terms of the Rossby number (Ro), the radio
activity-rotation relation follows a single trend and with no apparent
saturation from G to L dwarfs and down to Ro~10^-3; in X-rays and H-alpha there
is clear saturation at Ro<0.1, with super-saturation beyond M7. A similar trend
is observed for the radio surface flux (L_rad/R^2) as a function of Ro. The
continued role of rotation in the overall level of radio activity and in the
fraction of active sources, and the single trend of L_rad/L_bol and L_rad/R^2
as a function of Ro from G to L dwarfs indicates that rotation effects are
important in regulating the topology or strength of magnetic fields in at least
some fully-convective dwarfs. The fact that not all rapid rotators are detected
in the radio provides additional support to the idea of dual dynamo states.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3086v2,"The Origins of AGN Obscuration: The 'Torus' as a Dynamical, Unstable
  Driver of Accretion","  Multi-scale simulations have made it possible to follow gas inflows onto
massive black holes (BHs) from galactic scales to the accretion disk. When
sufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities
generically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided
stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel
rapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'
invoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has
characteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the
torus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are
substantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the
vertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and
warps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly
attributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:
misalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and
turbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN
luminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations
of gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities
in AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent. We argue that it is not
possible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (N_H)
distribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping on
small scales the predicted N_H distribution is in good agreement with
observations from 10^20-27 cm^-2. We examine how N_H scales with galaxy and AGN
properties, and find that AGN feedback may be necessary to explain some trends
with luminosity and/or redshift. The torus is not merely a bystander or passive
fuel source for accretion, but is itself the mechanism driving accretion.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1236v3,Why Are AGN and Host Galaxies Misaligned?,"  It is well-established observationally that the characteristic angular
momentum axis on small scales around AGN, traced by radio jets and the putative
torus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum axis of the
host galaxy. In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in
high-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and
inflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy
mergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can
sometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly
off-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth
and trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,
self-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in
the potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip
or re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the
presence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host
galaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be
an indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this
conclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean
that even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to
maximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and
inefficient jet formation. Even more random orientations are possible if there
is further, un-resolved clumpiness in the gas, and more ordered accretion may
occur if the inflow is slower and not self-gravitating.

of clustered star formation. Masers, shock heated $\rm{NH_3}$ gas, and outflows
indicate intense ongoing star formation in some cores while no such signatures

to characterize the galactic and local environments of short GRBs as a powerful
constraint on the nature of their progenitors. Using the HST data for 10 short
GRB hosts we determine the host morphological properties, measure precise
physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the galaxy centers, and study
the locations of short GRBs relative to their host light distributions. We find
that most short GRB hosts have exponential disk profiles, characteristic of
late-type galaxies, but with a median size that is twice as large as that of
long GRB hosts, commensurate with their higher luminosities. The observed
distribution of projected physical offsets, supplemented by ground-based
measurements, has a median of ~5 kpc, about 5 times larger than for long GRBs,
and in good agreement with predicted offset distributions for NS-NS binary
mergers. For the short GRB population as a whole we find the following robust
constraints: (i) >25% have projected offsets of <10 kpc; and (ii) >5% have
projected offsets of >20 kpc. We find no clear systematic trends for the offset
distribution of short GRBs with and without extended soft emission. While the
physical offsets are larger than for long GRBs, the distribution of
host-normalized offsets is nearly identical due to the larger size of short GRB
hosts. Finally, unlike long GRBs, which are concentrated in the brightest
regions of their host galaxies, short GRBs appear to under-represent the light
distribution of their hosts; this is true even in comparison to core-collapse
and Type Ia supernovae. Based on these results, we conclude that short GRBs are
consistent with a progenitor population of NS-NS binaries.

discovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster Abell 773,
which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z=5.2429.
This source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered by
Herschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mJy at 500\micron)
and its high redshift. The dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not the
cluster itself. The source has a far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of L_FIR= 1.1

at IRAM and the CO(2-1) at the EVLA. All lines decompose into a wide and strong

http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5520v2,Using Colors to Improve Photometric Metallicity Estimates for Galaxies,"  There is a well known correlation between the mass and metallicity of
star-forming galaxies. Because mass is correlated with luminosity, this
relation is often exploited, when spectroscopy is not available, to estimate
galaxy metallicities based on single band photometry. However, we show that
galaxy color is typically more effective than luminosity as a predictor of
metallicity. This is a consequence of the correlation between color and the
galaxy mass-to-light ratio and the recently discovered correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and residuals from the mass-metallicity relation. Using
Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy of 180,000 nearby galaxies, we derive
""LZC relations,"" empirical relations between metallicity (in seven common
strong line diagnostics), luminosity, and color (in ten filter pairs and four
methods of photometry). We show that these relations allow photometric
metallicity estimates, based on luminosity and a single optical color, that are
50% more precise than those made based on luminosity alone; galaxy metallicity
can be estimated to within 0.05 - 0.1 dex of the spectroscopically-derived
value depending on the metallicity diagnostic used. Including color information
in metallicity estimates also reduces systematic biases for populations skewed
toward high or low SFR environments, as we illustrate using the host galaxy of
the supernova SN 2010ay. This new tool will lend more statistical power to
studies of galaxy populations, such as supernova and gamma-ray burst (GRB) host

of the accreting transient black hole GRS 1739-278 during a very faint low hard
state at ~0.02% of the Eddington luminosity (for a distance of 8.5 kpc and a
mass of 10 M_sun ). The broad-band X-ray spectrum between 0.5-60 keV can be
well-described by a power law continuum with an exponential cutoff. The
continuum is unusually hard for such a low luminosity, with a photon index of
Gamma = 1.39 +/- 0.04. We find evidence for an additional reflection component
from an optically thick accretion disk at the 98% likelihood level. The
reflection fraction is low with R_refl = 0.043(+0.033,-0.023). In combination
with measurements of the spin and inclination parameters made with NuSTAR
during a brighter hard state by Miller and co-workers, we seek to constrain the
accretion disk geometry. Depending on the assumed emissivity profile of the
accretion disk, we find a truncation radius of 15-35 Rg (5-12 R_ISCO ) at the
90% confidence limit. These values depend strongly on the assumptions and we
discuss possible systematic uncertainties.

  for Energetics and Rates","  We present broad-band observations of the afterglow and environment of the
short GRB 111020A. An extensive X-ray light curve from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton
and Chandra, spanning ~100 seconds to 10 days after the burst, reveals a
significant break at t~2 days with pre- and post-break decline rates of
alphaX,1 ~ -0.78 and alphaX,2<-1.7, respectively. Interpreted as a jet break,
we infer a collimated outflow with an opening angle of ~3-8 degrees. The
resulting beaming-corrected gamma-ray (10-1000 keV band) and blastwave kinetic
energies are (2-3)e48 erg and (0.3-2)e49 erg, respectively, with the range
depending on the unknown redshift of the burst. We report a radio afterglow
limit of <39 microJy (3-sigma) from EVLA observations which, along with our
finding that vc<vX, constrains the circumburst density to n~0.01-0.1 cm^(-3).
Optical observations provide an afterglow limit of i>24.4 mag at 18 hours after
the burst, and reveal a potential host galaxy with i~24.3 mag. The
sub-arcsecond localization from Chandra provides a precise offset of
0.80""+/-0.11"" (1-sigma) from this galaxy corresponding to an offset of 5-7 kpc
for z=0.5-1.5. We find a high excess neutral Hydrogen column density of

fraction of short GRBs are collimated which may lead to a true event rate of
>100-1000 Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1), in good agreement with the NS-NS merger rate of
~200-3000 Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1). This consistency is promising for coincident short

  J1047539+212423 Measured From Periodic Radio Bursts","  Periodic radio bursts from very low mass stars and brown dwarfs
simultaneously probe their magnetic and rotational properties. The brown dwarf
2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5)
detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the
Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar
to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse
periodicity; previous VLA observations detected quiescent emission a factor of
~100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we
present 14 hours of Very Large Array observations of this object that reveal a
series of pulses at ~6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the
pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared
to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of ~1.77 hr and identify it
with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in
a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10
GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2M 1047+21 reaches
at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly-rotating
radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those
of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields
and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this
kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and
magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both
theories and observational data are currently scarce.

  Optical Searches for Gravitational Wave Counterparts","  The first direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the ground-based
interferometers is expected to occur within the next few years. These
interferometers will detect the mergers of compact object binaries composed of
neutron stars and/or black holes to a fiducial distance of ~200 Mpc and a
localization region of ~100 sq. deg. To maximize the science gains from such GW
detections it is essential to identify electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The
most promising such counterpart is optical/IR emission powered by the
radioactive decay of r-process elements synthesized in the neutron-rich merger
ejecta - a ""kilonova"". Here we present detailed simulated observations that
encompass a range of strategies for kilonova searches during GW follow-up. We
assess both the detectability of kilonovae and our ability to distinguish them
from a wide range of contaminating transients. We find that if pre-existing
template images for the localization region are available, then nightly
observations to a depth of i=24 mag and z=23 mag are required to achieve a 95%
detection rate; observations that commence within 12 hours of trigger will also
capture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta
properties. We also find that kilonovae can be robustly separated from other
types of transients utilizing cuts on color (i-z > 0 mag) and rise time (< 4
days). In the absence of a pre-existing template the observations must reach ~1
mag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate, but robust rejection of
contaminants can still be achieved. Motivated by the results of our simulations
we discuss the expected performance of current and future wide-field telescopes
in achieving these observational goals, and find that prior to LSST the Dark
Energy Camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope and Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru
8-m telescope offer the best kilonova discovery potential.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03239v1,"Electron Heating in Low Mach Number Perpendicular shocks. II. Dependence
  on the Pre-Shock Conditions","  Recent X-ray observations of merger shocks in galaxy clusters have shown that
the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons being hotter than
the electrons. In this work, the second of a series, we investigate by means of
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations the efficiency of electron
irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number shocks. We consider
values of plasma beta (ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures) in the range
$4\lesssim \beta_{p0}\lesssim 32$ and sonic Mach number (ratio of shock speed
to pre-shock sound speed) in the range $2\lesssim M_{s}\lesssim 5$, as
appropriate for galaxy cluster shocks. As shown in Paper I, magnetic field
amplification - induced by shock compression of the pre-shock field, or by
strong proton cyclotron and mirror modes accompanying the relaxation of proton
temperature anisotropy - can drive the electron temperature anisotropy beyond
the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of whistler
waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for efficient
entropy production. We find that the post-shock electron temperature $T_{e2}$
exceeds the adiabatic expectation $T_{e2,\rm ad}$ by an amount
$(T_{e2}-T_{e2,\rm ad})/T_{e0}\simeq 0.044 \,M_s (M_s-1)$ (here, $T_{e0}$ is
the pre-shock temperature), which depends only weakly on the plasma beta, over
the range $4\lesssim \beta_{p0}\lesssim 32$ which we have explored, and on the
proton-to-electron mass ratio (the coefficient of $\simeq 0.044$ is measured
for our fiducial $m_i/m_e=49$, and we estimate that it will decrease to $\simeq
0.03$ for the realistic mass ratio). Our results have important implications
for current and future observations of galaxy cluster shocks in the radio band
(synchrotron emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) and at X-ray frequencies.

  Simulations","  We utilise a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of
galaxy formation to investigate the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV)
slope, beta, and the ratio of the infrared luminosity to UV luminosity (IRX) in
the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies. We employ dust radiative
transfer calculations in which the SEDs of the stars in galaxies propagate
through the dusty interstellar medium. Our main goals are to understand the
origin of, and scatter in the IRX-beta relation; to assess the efficacy of
simplified stellar population synthesis screen models in capturing the
essential physics in the IRX-beta relation; and to understand systematic
deviations from the canonical local IRX-beta relations in particular
populations of high-redshift galaxies. Our main results follow. Galaxies that
have young stellar populations with relatively cospatial UV and IR emitting
regions and a Milky Way-like extinction curve fall on or near the standard
Meurer relation. This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models.
Scatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older
stellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local
starbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex
geometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue
UV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction
curves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV
extinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive
a fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the
canonical local relation. Finally, we use these results to develop an
understanding for the location of two particularly enigmatic populations of
galaxies in the IRX-beta plane: z~2-4 dusty star forming galaxies, and z>5 star
forming galaxies.

  matter?","  Social media data provides propitious opportunities for public health
research. However, studies suggest that disparities may exist in the
representation of certain populations (e.g., people of lower socioeconomic
status). To quantify and address these disparities in population
representation, we need demographic information, which is usually missing from
most social media platforms. Here, we propose an ensemble approach for
inferring demographics from social media data.
  Several methods have been proposed for inferring demographic attributes such
as, age, gender and race/ethnicity. However, most of these methods require
large volumes of data, which makes their application to large scale studies
challenging. We develop a scalable approach that relies only on user names to
predict gender. We develop three separate classifiers trained on data
containing the gender labels of 7,953 Twitter users from Kaggle.com. Next, we
combine predictions from the individual classifiers using a stacked
generalization technique and apply the ensemble classifier to a dataset of
36,085 geotagged foodborne illness related tweets from the United States.
  Our ensemble approach achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
of 0.828, 0.851, 0.852 and 0.837, respectively, higher than the individual
machine learning approaches. The ensemble classifier also covers any user with
an alphanumeric name, while the data matching approach, which achieves an
accuracy of 0.917, only covers 67% of users. Application of our method to
reports of foodborne illness in the United States highlights disparities in
tweeting by gender and shows that counties with a high volume of
foodborne-illness related tweets are heavily overrepresented by female Twitter
users.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06905v1,A Theory for the Variation of Dust Attenuation Laws in Galaxies,"  In this paper, we provide a physical model for the origin of variations in
the shapes and bump strengths of dust attenuation laws in galaxies by combining
a large suite of cosmological ""zoom-in"" galaxy formation simulations with 3D
Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer calculations. We model galaxies over 3
orders of magnitude in stellar mass, ranging from Milky Way like systems
through massive galaxies at high-redshift. Critically, for these calculations
we employ a constant underlying dust extinction law in all cases, and examine
how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impact the resultant
attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant
dust extinction curve, we find dramatic variations in the derived attenuation
laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the
complexities of star-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young
stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old
stars steepen curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we
find dramatic variation in the 2175 Angstrom ultraviolet (UV) bump strength,
including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These bump strengths are
primarily influenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model,
with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken
together, these results lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation
curve slope and 2175 Angstrom bump strength. Finally, we apply these results to
a 25 Mpc/h box cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in order to model the
expected dispersion in attenuation laws at integer redshifts from z=0-6. A
significant dispersion is expected at low redshifts, and decreases toward z=6.
We provide tabulated results for the best fit median attenuation curve at all
redshifts.

  Essential and Efficient","  We present simulated observations to assess the ability of LSST and the WFD
survey to detect and characterize kilonovae - the optical emission associated
with binary neutron star (and possibly black hole - neutron star) mergers. We
expand on previous studies in several critical ways by exploring a range of
kilonova models and several choices of cadence, as well as by evaluating the
information content of the resulting light curves. We find that, depending on
the precise choice of cadence, the WFD survey will achieve an average kilonova
detection efficiency of $\approx 1.6-2.5\%$ and detect only $\approx 3-6$
kilonovae per year. The detected kilonovae will be within the detection volume
of Advanced LIGO/Virgo (ALV). By refitting the best resulting LSST light curves
with the same model used to generate them we find the model parameters are
generally weakly constrained, and are accurate to at best a factor of $2-3$.
Motivated by the finding that the WFD will yield a small number of kilonova
detections, with poor light curves and marginal information content, and that
the detections are in any case inside the ALV volume, we argue that
target-of-opportunity follow-up of gravitational wave triggers is a much more
effective approach for kilonova studies. We outline the qualitative foundation
for such a program with the goal of minimizing the impact on LSST operations.
We argue that observations in the $gz$-bands with a total time investment per
event of $\approx 1.5$ hour per 10 deg$^2$ of search area is sufficient to
rapidly detect and identify kilonovae with $\gtrsim 90\%$ efficiency. For an
estimated event rate of $\sim20$ per year visible to LSST, this accounts for
$\sim1.5\%$ of the total survey time. In this regime, LSST has the potential to
be a powerful tool for kilonovae discovery, with detected events handed off to
other narrow-field facilities for further monitoring.

has been used to simulate the wind from Barnard's Star and to estimate the
conditions at the location of its recently discovered planetary companion. Such
models require knowledge of the stellar surface magnetic field that is
currently unknown for Barnard's Star. We circumvent this by considering the
observed field distributions of three different stars that constitute
admissible magnetic proxies of this object. Under these considerations,
Barnard's Star b experiences less intense wind pressure than the much more
close-in planet Proxima~b and the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system. The milder
wind conditions are more a result of its much greater orbital distance rather
than in differences in the surface magnetic field strengths of the host stars.
The dynamic pressure experienced by the planet is comparable to present-day
Earth values, but it can undergo variations by factors of several during
current sheet crossings in each orbit. The magnetospause standoff distance
would be $\sim$\,$20 - 40$\,\% smaller than that of the Earth for an equivalent

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) taking place in realistic magnetic field
configurations of moderately active M-dwarf stars. Our analysis indicates that
a clear, novel, and observable, coronal response is generated due to the
collapse of the eruption and its eventual release into the stellar wind.
Escaping CME events, weakly suppressed by the large-scale field, induce a
flare-like signature in the emission from coronal material at different
temperatures due to compression and associated heating. Such flare-like
profiles display a distinctive temporal evolution in their Doppler shift signal
(from red to blue), as the eruption first collapses towards the star and then
perturbs the ambient magnetized plasma on its way outwards. For stellar fields
providing partial confinement, CME fragmentation takes place, leading to rise
and fall flow patterns which resemble the solar coronal rain cycle. In strongly
suppressed events, the response is better described as a gradual brightening,
in which the failed CME is deposited in the form of a coronal rain cloud
leading to a much slower rise in the ambient high-energy flux by relatively
small factors ($\sim2-3$). In all the considered cases (escaping/confined) a
fractional decrease in the emission from mid-range coronal temperature plasma
occurs, similar to the coronal dimming events observed on the Sun. Detection of
the observational signatures of these CME-induced features requires a sensitive

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07266v1,An Earth-like stellar wind environment for Proxima Centauri c,"  A new planet has been recently discovered around Proxima Centauri. With an
orbital separation of $\sim$$1.44$ au and a minimum mass of about $7$
$M_{\oplus}$, Proxima c is a prime direct imaging target for atmospheric
characterization. The latter can only be performed with a good understanding of
the space environment of the planet, as multiple processes can have profound
effects on the atmospheric structure and evolution. Here, we take one step in
this direction by generating physically-realistic numerical simulations of
Proxima's stellar wind, coupled to a magnetosphere and ionosphere model around
Proxima c. We evaluate their expected variation due to the magnetic cycle of
the host star, as well as for plausible inclination angles for the exoplanet
orbit. Our results indicate stellar wind dynamic pressures comparable to
present-day Earth, with a slight increase (by a factor of 2) during high
activity periods of the star. A relatively weak interplanetary magnetic field
at the distance of Proxima c leads to negligible stellar wind Joule heating of
the upper atmosphere (about $10\%$ of the solar wind contribution on Earth) for
an Earth-like planetary magnetic field ($0.3$ G). Finally, we provide an
assessment of the likely extreme conditions experienced by the exoplanet
candidate Proxima d, tentatively located at $0.029$ au with a minimum mass of
$0.29$ $M_{\oplus}$.

advection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small
or very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the
temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is
quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular
velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long
before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is
positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing
outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will
tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated
accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars
and the widespread occurrence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.

calibrated based on the observed C/H ratio in the intergalactic medium at z=3,
assuming a Scalo mass function for the stars. The associated dust absorbs
starlight energy and emits it at longer wavelengths. For a uniform mix of
metals and dust with the intergalactic gas, we find that the dust distorts the
microwave background spectrum by a y-parameter in the range
(0.02-2)x10^{-5}(M_d/0.3M_sun), where M_d is the average mass of dust produced
per supernova. The opacity of intergalactic dust to infrared sources at
redshifts z>10 is significant, tau=(0.1-1)x(M_d/0.3M_sun), and could be
detected with the Next Generation Space Telescope. Although dust suppresses the
Ly-alpha emission from early sources, the redshifts of star clusters at z=10-35
can be easily inferred from the Lyman-limit break in their infrared spectrum
between 1-3.5 micron.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9705067v1,Are Particles in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flows Thermal?,"  We investigate the form of the momentum distribution function for protons and
electrons in an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We show that for all
accretion rates, Coulomb collisions are too inefficient to thermalize the
protons. The proton distribution function is therefore determined by the
viscous heating mechanism, which is unknown. The electrons, however, can
exchange energy quite efficiently through Coulomb collisions and the emission
and absorption of synchrotron photons. We find that for accretion rates greater
than \sim 10^{-3} of the Eddington accretion rate, the electrons have a thermal
distribution throughout the accretion flow. For lower accretion rates, the
electron distribution function is determined by the electron's source of
heating, which is primarily adiabatic compression. Using the principle of
adiabatic invariance, we show that an adiabatically compressed collisionless
gas maintains a thermal distribution until the particle energies become
relativistic. We derive a new, non-thermal, distribution function which arises
for relativistic energies and provide analytic formulae for the synchrotron
radiation from this distribution. Finally, we discuss its implications for the
emission spectra from ADAFs.

occupy a region comparable to the virial radius of the cluster, then 1% of

counteracted by dust obscuration, since the line-of-sight to the QSO passes
close to the center of the galactic disk. The dust in the lens is likely to be
correlated with neutral hydrogen, which in turn should leave a Lyman-alpha
absorption signature on the QSO spectrum. We use the estimated dust-to-gas
ratio of the Milky-Way galaxy as a mean and allow a spread in its values to
calculate the effects of dust on lensing by low redshift spiral galaxies. Using
a no-evolution model for spirals at z<1 we find (in Lambda=0 cosmologies) that
the magnification bias due to lensing is stronger than dust obscuration for QSO
samples with a magnitude limit B<16. The density parameter of neutral hydrogen,
Omega_HI, is overestimated in such samples and is underestimated for fainter
QSOs.

This increases the significance of the difference between the quiescent

difference provides direct evidence for the existence of event horizons in the
BHXN: they have larger luminosity swings because the quiescent mass transfer
energy is being hidden behind the event horizon.

faster than light. After a day, the ring radius is comparable to the Einstein
radius of a solar mass lens at a cosmological distance. Thus, microlensing by
an intervening star can modify significantly the lightcurve and polarization
signal from a GRB afterglow. We show that the achromatic amplification signal
of the afterglow flux can be used to determine the impact parameter and
expansion rate of the source in units of the Einstein radius of the lens, and
probe the superluminal nature of the expansion. If the synchrotron emission
from the afterglow photosphere originates from a set of coherent magnetic field
patches, microlensing would induce polarization variability due to the
transient magnification of the patches behind the lens. The microlensing
interpretation of the flux and polarization data can be confirmed by a parallax
experiment which would probe the amplification peak at different times. The
fraction of microlensed afterglows can be used to calibrate the density

that the energy cascades almost entirely perpendicular to the local magnetic
field. As a result, the cyclotron resonance is unimportant in dissipating the
turbulent energy. Motivated by the GS cascade, we calculate the linear
collisionless dissipation of Alfven waves with frequencies much less than the
proton cyclotron frequency, but with perpendicular wavelengths of order the
Larmor radius of thermal protons. In plasmas appropriate to hot accretion flows
(proton temperature much greater than electron temperature) the dissipated
Alfven wave energy primarily heats the protons. For a plasma with $\beta \lsim
5$, however, where $\beta$ is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic
pressure, the MHD assumptions utilized in the GS analysis break down before
most of the energy in Alfven waves is dissipated; how the cascade then proceeds
is unclear. Hot accretion flows, such as advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs), are expected to contain significant levels of MHD turbulence. This
work suggests that, for $\beta \gsim 5$, the Alfvenic component of such
turbulence primarily heats the protons. Significant proton heating is required
for the viability of ADAF models. We contrast our results on particle heating
in ADAFs with recent work by Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace (1997).

close to reionization, 1<[(1+z_s)/(1+z_{reion})]<(32/27), the Gunn-Peterson
trough splits into disjoint Lyman-alpha, beta, and possibly higher Lyman series
troughs, with some transmitted flux in between these troughs. We show that
although the transmitted flux is suppressed considerably by the dense
Lyman-alpha forest after reionization, it is still detectable for sufficiently
bright sources and can be used to infer the reionization redshift. The Next
Generation Space Telescope will reach the spectroscopic sensitivity required
for the detection of such sources.

uncertainty in the gamma-ray beaming angle, theta, leaves the total energy
release (proportional to theta^2) and the event rate per galaxy (proportional
to 1/theta^2) unknown to within orders of magnitude. Since the delayed radio
emission of GRB sources originates from a mildly relativistic shock and
receives only weak relativistic beaming, the rate of radio-selected transients
with no GRB counterpart can be used to set an upper limit on 1/theta^2. We find
that a VLA survey with a sensitivity of 0.1 mJy at 10 GHz could identify more
than 2e4/(theta/10degrees)^2 radio afterglows across the sky if each source is
sampled at least twice over a period of one month or longer. From the total
number of >0.1 mJy sources observed at 8.44 GHz and the fraction of fading
sources at 1.44 GHz, we get the crude limit, theta>6 degrees.

is tangled and roughly isotropic, flux freezing is insufficient to maintain the
field in equipartition with the gas. In this case, we expect a fraction of the
energy generated by shear in the flow to be used to build up the magnetic field
strength as the gas flows in; the remaining energy heats the particles. We
argue that strictly equipartition magnetic fields are incompatible with a
priori reasonable levels of particle heating; instead, the plasma $\beta$ in
ADAFs (defined to be the gas pressure divided by magnetic/turbulent pressure)
is likely to be $\gsim 5$; correspondingly, the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is
likely to be $\lsim 0.2$

current observations of soft X-ray transients and Sgr A* suggest that at least
$\sim 10 %$ of the mass originating at large radii must reach the central
object. For large $\delta \sim 0.3$, however, models with significantly more
mass loss are in agreement with the observations. We also discuss constraints
on advection-dominated accretion flow models imposed by recent radio
observations of NGC 4649 and other nearby elliptical galaxies. We conclude by
highlighting future observations which may clarify the importance of mass loss

bright, dusty, starburst galaxies would preferentially eject a dust component
with a shallower opacity curve (hence less reddening) and a higher opacity/mass
than the observed galactic dust which is left behind. Such dust could cause the
falloff in flux at high-z without violating constraints on reddening or
metallicity. The specific model presented is of needle-like dust, which is
expected from the theory of crystal growth and has been detected in samples of
interstellar dust. Carbon needles with conservative properties can supply the
necessary opacity, and would very likely be ejected from galaxies as required.
The model is not subject to the arguments given in the literature against grey
dust, but may be constrained by future data from supernova searches done at
higher redshift, in clusters, or over a larger frequency range.

calculate the dynamics of accreting matter in the combined gravitational
potential of a host galaxy and a central black hole assuming a steady state,
spherically symmetric flow (i.e., no angular momentum). The global dynamics
depends primarily on the accretion rate. For large accretion rates, no simple,
smooth transition between a cooling flow and an accretion flow is possible; the
gas cools towards zero temperature just inside its sonic radius, which lies
well outside the region where the gravitational influence of the central black
hole is important. For accretion rates below a critical value, however, the
accreting gas evolves smoothly from a radiatively driven cooling flow at large
radii to a nearly adiabatic (Bondi) flow at small radii. We argue that this is
the relevant parameter regime for most observed cooling flows. The transition
from the cooling flow to the accretion flow should be observable in M87 with

amplitude of flux fluctuations in the lightcurve of afterglows due to
inhomogeneities in the surrounding medium. Such inhomogeneities are an
inevitable consequence of interstellar turbulence, but could also be generated
by variability and anisotropy in a precursor wind from the GRB progenitor.
Detection of their properties could provide important clues about the
environments of GRB sources. We apply our calculations to GRB990510, where an
rms scatter of 2% was observed for the optical flux fluctuations on the 0.1--2
hour timescale during the first day of the afterglow, consistent with it being
entirely due to photometric noise (Stanek et al. 1999). The resulting upper
limits on the density fluctuations on scales of 20-200 AU around the source of

energy available for particle acceleration in a corona. The connection between
energy and magnetic helicity arises because the generation of large scale field
is linked to a generation of large scale magnetic helicity. In a steady state,
the relative magnetic helicity associated with the large scale field can
escape, accompanied by an equal and opposite small scale contribution from the
field, since the total magnetic helicity in large magnetic Reynolds number
flows is conserved. From the helicity flow, a lower limit on the magnetic
energy deposited in the corona can be estimated. Steady coronal activity and
the dissipation of magnetic energy is therefore a signature of an internal
dynamo. Our theoretical estimate of the power delivered by a mean field dynamo
is consistent with that inferred from observations to be delivered to the solar

  Medium","  The universe is filled with a diffuse and isotropic extragalactic background

the unsolved puzzles in cosmology. Less than a quarter of the gamma-ray flux

constitute a truly diffuse background whose origin has hitherto been
mysterious. Here we show that the shock waves induced by gravity during the

population of highly-relativistic electrons with a maximum Lorentz factor above
10^7. These electrons scatter a small fraction of the microwave background
photons in the present-day universe up to gamma-ray energies, thereby providing
the gamma-ray background. The predicted diffuse flux agrees with the observed
background over more than four decades in photon energy, and implies a mean
cosmological density of baryons which is consistent with Big-Bang

cosmologies, the smallest nonlinear objects are the numerous small halos that
condense with virial temperatures below 10,000 K. Such ``minihalos'' are not
yet resolved in large-scale three-dimensional cosmological simulations. Here we
employ a semi-analytic method, combined with three-dimensional simulations of
individual minihalos, to examine their importance during cosmological

potentially play an important role as sinks of ionizing radiation. If
reionization occurs at sufficiently high redshifts (z_r > 20), the
intergalactic medium is heated to 10,000 K and most minihalos never form. On
the other hand, if z_r < 20, a significant fraction (>10 percent) of all
baryons have already collapsed into minihalos, and are subsequently removed
from the halos by photoevaporation as the ionizing background flux builds up.
We show that this process can require a significant budget of ionizing photons;
exceeding the production by a straightforward extrapolation back in time of
known quasar and galaxy populations by a factor of up to 10 and 3,

derive the highest plausible redshift for quasars which are not lensed or

strong and could suppress the thermal instability. We analyze the role of
thermal conduction in both the hot settling flow and the SLE solution. In the

via free streaming of electrons along tangled magnetic field lines. We find
that conduction is strong enough to make the flow marginally stable. In

Spitzer-type transport. In this case, conduction is weaker, and we find that
the SLE solution is thermally unstable even in the presence of conduction.

expanding magnetized bubble in the IGM. We model the expansion of the remnant
quasar bubbles and calculate their distribution as a function magnetic field
strength at different redshifts. We find that by a redshift z ~ 3, about 5-80%
of the IGM volume is filled by magnetic fields with an energy density > 10% of
the mean thermal energy density of a photo-ionized IGM (at ~ 10^4 K). As
massive galaxies and X-ray clusters condense out of the magnetized IGM, the
adiabatic compression of the magnetic field could result in the fields observed
in these systems without a need for further dynamo amplification.

and star forming regions. The OB stars both photo--ionize molecular gas as well
as sweep up and compress interstellar gas through winds, ionization fronts, and
supernovae. In this contribution, we examine the effect massive stars have on
the formation of young stellar clusters. We first discuss the processes by
which OB stars destroy cluster--forming molecular cores, and hence terminate
star formation. We overview observational evidence that OB stars forming in
young stellar clusters destroy their parental cores on a timescale of 0.1 Myr,
and we discuss some of the implications of this result. We then summarize
extensive observations of the NGC 281 molecular cloud complex, and present
evidence that two types of triggered star formation are occurring in this
complex. Our goal is to underscore the impact massive stars have on cluster
formation over distances ranging from 0.1 pc to 300 pc.

available software package called CMBfit, useful for anyone wishing to measure
cosmological parameters by combining WMAP with other observations. The method
takes advantage of the underlying physics by transforming into a set of
parameters where the WMAP likelihood surface is accurately fit by the
exponential of a quartic or sextic polynomial. Building on previous physics
based approximations by Hu et.al., Kosowsky et.al. and Chu et.al., it combines
their speed with precision cosmology grade accuracy. A Fortran code for
computing the WMAP likelihood for a given set of parameters is provided,
pre-calibrated against CMBfast, accurate to Delta lnL ~ 0.05 over the entire
2sigma region of the parameter space for 6 parameter ``vanilla'' Lambda CDM
models. We also provide 7-parameter fits including spatial curvature,
gravitational waves and a running spectral index.

fluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size
distribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of

the neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from
the HII regions that should be observable with the next generation of
low-frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission
from the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions
beyond the power spectrum and show that our model of reionization qualitatively
changes the distribution of neutral gas in the IGM.

elliptical galaxies, in agreement with earlier work. However, if the progenitor
disks are gas-dominated, new types of outcomes are possible. In fact, we show
that a prominent disk may survive in certain cases. To illustrate this
scenario, we analyze an extreme example with progenitor galaxies consisting of
dark matter halos, pure gas disks, and no bulges, as might be appropriate for
mergers at high redshifts. While rapid star formation triggered by tidal
torques during the merger forms a central, rotating bulge in the remnant, not
all the gas is consumed in the burst. The remaining gas cools very quickly and
settles into an extended star-forming disk, yielding an object similar to a
spiral galaxy, and not an early type galaxy. This is contrary to the usual view
that major mergers invariably destroy disks. The morphological evolution of
galaxies can therefore be more complicated than often assumed, and in
particular, theoretical constraints based on the fragility of spiral disks need
to be reevaluated.

introduces a spread to the reionization times of different regions with the

the shape of the power spectrum of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts in a way

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0511242v2,Three-Body Kick to a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy During a Merger,"  The quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc away from a
galaxy that was likely disturbed by a recent merger. The lack of a massive
spheroid of stars around the quasar raised the unlikely suggestion that it may
have formed in a dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
consequence of a dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it interacted with a
binary black hole system during a galaxy merger event. The typical stalling
radius for a ~10^9 solar mass binary provides a kick of order the escape
velocity of the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with the observed
low relative velocity between the quasar and the merger-remnant galaxy. The gas
carried with the black hole throughout the three-body interaction fuels the
quasar for the duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
recoil could not have produced the required kick.

these low-mass galaxies do not necessarily contain classical bulges, Barth,

masses obey the same relation as more massive systems. In order to characterize
the properties of the dwarf hosts without the glare of the active nucleus, we
have compiled a complementary sample of narrow-line active galaxies with
low-mass hosts. The host galaxy properties, both their structures and stellar
populations, are consistent with the general properties of low-mass, blue
galaxies from Sloan. The black holes in these galaxies are probably radiating
close to their Eddington limits, suggesting we may have found Type 2 analogues
of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.

Given the very low quiescent luminosity of Sgr A* in the near infrared, the
existence of a hard surface, even in the limit in which the radius approaches
the horizon, places severe constraints upon the steady mass accretion rate in
the source, requiring dM/dt < 10^-12 M_sun/yr. This limit is well below the
minimum accretion rate needed to power the observed submillimeter luminosity of
Sgr A*. We thus argue that Sgr A* does not have a surface, i.e., it must have
an event horizon. The argument could be made more restrictive by an order of
magnitude with microarcsecond resolution imaging, e.g., with submillimeter
VLBI.

Over a Hubble time, thermal evaporation could drain up to a tenth of the
cluster gas at its virial temperature. The evaporated fraction could increase
dramatically if additional heat is deposited into the gas by cluster mergers,
active galactic nuclei or supernovae. Thermal evaporation is not included in
existing cosmological simulations since they are based on the fluid
approximation. Measurements of the baryon mass fraction in the outer envelopes

these processes evolve a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum

response to an external stress is examined in detail. We determine dislocation
constriction energy and critical stress for cross-slip, and from the latter, we
estimate the cross-slip energy barrier for the straight screw dislocations.

formation of C-H bonds, leading to the unzipping of the nanotube wall. We
provide insights into the underlying electronic structure responsible for the
H-induced unzipping of the nanotube, lending strong support to the recent
experimental observations for the coalescence of single-walled nanotubes in the
presence of atomic hydrogen. Interestingly, H atoms chemisorbed inside the

we find that phase fluctuations sharply reduce the observed condensate

detuning, that is a direct signature of quantum phase fluctuations. The

condensation coupled to the dilaton for string models in which the gauge
coupling constant does not receive string threshold corrections. The new
ingredients in our treatment are that we take into account the one-loop
correction to the dilaton K\""ahler potential and we use a formulation which
includes a chiral field $H$ corresponding to the gaugino bilinear. We find
through explicit calculation that supersymmetry in the Yang-Mills sector is
broken by gaugino condensation.
  The dilaton and $H$ field have masses on the order of the gaugino
condensation scale independently of the dilaton VEV. Although the calculation
performed here is at best a model of the full gaugino condensation dynamics,
the result shows that the one-loop correction to the dilaton K\""ahler potential
as well as the detailed dynamics at the gaugino condensation scale may play an
important role in solving the dilaton runaway problem.

  Manifold","  From the work of Lian, Liu, and Yau on ""Mirror Principle"", in the explicit
computation of the Euler data $Q=\{Q_0, Q_1, ... \}$ for an equivariant
concavex bundle ${\cal E}$ over a toric manifold, there are two places the
structure of the bundle comes into play: (1) the multiplicative characteric
class $Q_0$ of $V$ one starts with, and (2) the splitting type of ${\cal E}$.
Equivariant bundles over a toric manifold has been classified by Kaneyama,
using data related to the linearization of the toric action on the base toric
manifold. In this article, we relate the splitting type of ${\cal E}$ to the
classifying data of Kaneyama. From these relations, we compute the splitting
type of a couple of nonsplittable equivariant vector bundles over toric
manifolds that may be of interest to string theory and mirror symmetry. A code
in Mathematica that carries out the computation of some of these examples is
attached.

quantize Yang-Mills gauge theory. If such a consistent quantization were to
exist, it is reasonable to expect a ``Wightman reconstruction theorem,'' by
which a Hilbert space and quantum field operators are recovered from n-point
functions. However, the original version of the Wightman theorem is not
equipped to deal with gauge fields or fields taking values in a noncommutative
space. This paper explores a generalization of the Wightman construction which
allows the fundamental fields to take values in an arbitrary topological
*-algebra. In particular, the construction applies to fields valued in a Lie
algebra representation, of the type required by Yang-Mills theory. This appears
to be the correct framework for a generalized reconstruction theorem amenable
to modern quantum theories such as gauge theories and matrix models. We obtain
the interesting result that a large class of quantum theories are expected to
arise as limits of matrix models, which may be related to the well-known
conjecture of Kazakov. Further, by considering deformations of the associative
algebra structure in the noncommutative target space, we define certain
one-parameter families of quantum field theories and conjecture a relationship
with deformation quantization.

alternative conception. A few years later Mazur began using wireless handheld

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0007036v1,Quantum versus Classical Learnability,"  We consider quantum versions of two well-studied classical learning models:
Angluin's model of exact learning from membership queries and Valiant's
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model of learning from random examples. We
give positive and negative results for quantum versus classical learnability.
For each of the two learning models described above, we show that any concept
class is information-theoretically learnable from polynomially many quantum
examples if and only if it is information-theoretically learnable from
polynomially many classical examples. In contrast to this information-theoretic
equivalence betwen quantum and classical learnability, though, we observe that
a separation does exist between efficient quantum and classical learnability.
For both the model of exact learning from membership queries and the PAC model,
we show that under a widely held computational hardness assumption for
classical computation (the intractability of factoring), there is a concept
class which is polynomial-time learnable in the quantum version but not in the
classical version of the model.

which is not very restrictive, and which has a natural physical interpretation,
is that the corresponding Kraus operators form a representation of a Lie
algebra. Physically, this is a symmetry algebra for the interaction
Hamiltonian. This paper begins a systematic study of channels defined by
representations; the famous Werner-Holevo channel is one element of this
infinite class. We show that the channel derived from the defining
representation of SU(n) is a depolarizing channel for all $n$, but for most
other representations this is not the case. Since the Bloch sphere is not
appropriate here, we develop technology which is a generalization of Bloch's
technique. Our method works by representing the density matrix as a polynomial
in symmetrized products of Lie algebra generators, with coefficients that are
symmetric tensors. Using these tensor methods we prove eleven theorems, derive
many explicit formulas and show other interesting properties of quantum
channels in various dimensions, with various Lie symmetry algebras. We also
derive numerical estimates on the size of a generalized ``Bloch sphere'' for
certain channels. There remain many open questions which are indicated at
various points through the paper.

suppression without the need for noiseless subsystems. There is a certain
trade-off; our results do not necessarily apply to an arbitrary initial density
matrix, or for completely generic noise parameters. On the other hand, our
computational methods are novel and the result--suppression of decoherence in
the error-algebra approach without noiseless subsystems--is an interesting new

for a comparable amount of diffuse mass to fill the volume of the Local Group,
we find that the two galaxies are likely to collide in a few billion years -
within the Sun's lifetime. During the the interaction, there is a chance that
the Sun will be pulled away from its present orbital radius and reside in an
extended tidal tail. The likelihood for this outcome increases as the merger
progresses, and there is a remote possibility that our Sun will be more tightly
bound to Andromeda than to the Milky Way before the final merger. Eventually,
after the merger has completed, the Sun is most likely to be scattered to the
outer halo and reside at much larger radii (>30 kpc). The density profiles of
the stars, gas and dark matter in the merger product resemble those of
elliptical galaxies. Our Local Group model therefore provides a prototype
progenitor of late--forming elliptical galaxies.

of tracing the cosmic distribution of atomic hydrogen at redshifts 6-15 through
its 21-cm line. The observations will probe the large-scale brightness
fluctuations sourced by ionization fluctuations during cosmic reionization.
Since detailed maps will be difficult to extract due to noise and foreground
emission, efforts have focused on a statistical detection of the 21-cm
fluctuations. During cosmic reionization, these fluctuations are highly
non-Gaussian and thus more information can be extracted than just the
one-dimensional function that is usually considered, i.e., the correlation
function. We calculate a two-dimensional function that if measured
observationally would allow a more thorough investigation of the properties of
the underlying ionizing sources. This function is the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the difference in the 21-cm brightness temperature between
two points, as a function of the separation between the points. While the
standard correlation function is determined by a complicated mixture of
contributions from density and ionization fluctuations, we show that the
difference PDF holds the key to separately measuring the statistical properties
of the ionized regions.

the nature of surface brightness excesses at large radii observed in some

produce the antitruncation via two competing effects: (1) merger-driven gas
inflows that concentrate mass in the center of the primary galaxy and contract
its inner density profile; and (2) angular momentum transferred outwards by the
interaction, causing the outer disk to expand. In our experiments, this
requires both a significant supply of gas in the primary disk, and that the
encounter be prograde with moderate orbital angular momentum. The stellar
surface mass density profiles of our remnants both qualitatively and
quantitatively resemble the broken exponentials observed in local face--on
spirals that display antitruncations. Moreover, the observed trend towards more
frequent antitruncation relative to classical truncation in earlier Hubble
types is consistent with a merger-driven scenario.

the plate thickness decreases, thereby enhancing plate weakness. These effects
contribute favorably to the subduction of the lithosphere, an essential
component of plate tectonics. Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate
tectonics in the one earth-mass regime disappear as mass increases:
super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behaviour.

the system AM Herculis (AM Her).
  Aims: We determine the state duty cycles, and their relationships with the
mass transfer process and binary orbital evolution of the system.
  Methods: We make use of the photographic plate archive of the Harvard College
Observatory between 1890 and 1953 and visual observations collected by the
American Association of Variable Star Observers between 1978 and 2005. We
determine the statistical probability of the two states, their distribution and
recurrence behaviors.
  Results: We find that the fractional high state duty cycle of the system AM
Her is 63%. The data show no preference of timescales on which high or low
states occur. However, there appears to be a pattern of long and short duty
cycle alternation, suggesting that the state transitions retain memories. We
assess models for the high/low states for polars (AM Her type systems). We
propose that the white-dwarf magnetic field plays a key role in regulating the
mass transfer rate and hence the high/low brightness states, due to variations
in the magnetic-field configuration in the system.

Milky Way via a high-eccentricity, flyby encounter. These initial conditions
are more cosmologically motivated than those considered in previous works. We
find that the encounters we examine generically produce a series of nearly
dynamically cold ring-like features on low-eccentricity orbits that persist
over timescales of ~2-4 Gyr via the tidal response of the primary galaxy to the
close passage of the satellite. Moreover, they are both qualitatively and
quantitatively similar to the distribution, kinematics, and stellar population
of the Monoceros ring. Therefore, we find that a high eccentricity flyby by a
satellite galaxy represents a cosmologically appealing scenario for forming
kinematically distinct ring-like features around the Milky Way.

the accretion disk that fuels the central black hole and provide a potential
site of nuclear star formation. Unfortunately, most of the gas in maser disks
is currently not being probed; large maser gains favor paths that are
characterized by a small velocity gradient and require rare edge-on
orientations of the disk. Here we propose a method for mapping the atomic
hydrogen distribution in nuclear disks through its 21cm absorption against the
radio continuum glow around the central black hole. In NGC 4258, the 21cm
optical depth may approach unity for high angular-resolution (VLBI) imaging of
coherent clumps which are dominated by thermal broadening and have the column
density inferred from X-ray absorption data, ~10^{23}/cm^2. Spreading the 21cm
absorption over the full rotation velocity width of the material in front of
the narrow radio jets gives a mean optical depth of ~0.1. Spectroscopic
searches for the 21cm absorption feature in other galaxies can be used to
identify the large population of inclined gaseous disks which are not masing in
our direction. Follow-up imaging of 21cm silhouettes of accelerating clumps
within these disks can in turn be used to measure cosmological distances.

Throughout the remaining frequency range, our data show no signature of the

advantages of both single dishes and interferometers. The electric field is
digitized by antennas on a rectangular grid, after which a series of Fast

now reached about 1 GHz, and will likely continue doubling every couple of

magnitude larger field-of-view, translating into dramatically better
sensitivity for large-area surveys. The key advantages over traditional
interferometers are cost (the correlator computational cost for an N-element
array scales as N log N rather than N^2) and a compact synthesized beam. We
argue that 21 cm tomography could be an ideal first application of a very large
Fast Fourier Transform Telescope, which would provide both massive sensitivity
improvements per dollar and mitigate the off-beam point source foreground
problem with its clean beam. Another potentially interesting application is

kinetic outflows to be greater than 99.6%, considerably larger than those

observed galaxy fluctuation field contains additional contributions arising
from the distortion in observable quantities and these include tensor
contributions as well as numerous scalar contributions. We generalize the
linear bias approximation to relate the observed galaxy fluctuation field to
the underlying matter distribution in a gauge-invariant way. Our full formalism
is essential for the consistency of theoretical predictions. As our first
application, we compute the angular auto correlation of large-scale structure
and its cross correlation with CMB temperature anisotropies. We comment on the
possibility of detecting primordial gravity waves using galaxy clustering and
discuss further applications of our formalism.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1102v1,"Concentrating the Dark Matter in Galaxy Clusters through Tidal Stripping
  of Baryonically-Compressed Galactic Halos","  Gravitational lensing observations of massive X-ray clusters imply a steep
characteristic density profile marked by a central concentration of dark
matter. The observed mass fraction within a projected radius of 150 kpc is
twice that found in state-of-the-art dark matter simulations of the standard
Lambda-CDM cosmology. A central baryon enhancement that could explain this
discrepancy is not observed, leaving a major puzzle. We propose a solution
based on the merger histories of clusters. A significant fraction of the final
dark matter content of a cluster halo originates within galaxy-sized halos, in
which gas can cool and compress the dark matter core to high densities. The
subsequent tidal stripping of this compressed dark matter occurs in denser
regions that are closer to the center of the cluster halo. Eventually, the
originally cooled gas must be dispersed into the intracluster medium through
feedback, for consistency with observations that do not find central baryon
enhancements in clusters. Still, the early adiabatic compression of the
galactic dark matter leaves a net effect on the cluster. Using a simple model
for this process, we show that the central cluster profile is substantially
modified, potentially explaining the observed discrepancy.

an external perturber, a quasi-resonance occurs if the spin frequency of the

responsible for the formation of long tails and bridges of stars during galaxy
collisions. For high-speed encounters, the resulting velocity perturbations can
be described within the impulse approximation. The traditional impulse
approximation, however, does not distinguish between prograde and retrograde
encounters, and therefore completely misses the resonant response. Here, using
perturbation theory, we compute the effects of quasi-resonant phenomena on
stars orbiting within a disk. Explicit expressions are derived for the velocity

gravitational perturber passing either on a straight line or parabolic orbit.
Comparisons with numerical restricted three-body calculations illustrate the

particular in ABC algorithms has bearings on the validation of the resulting
inference. Those statistics are nonetheless customarily used in ABC algorithms
without consistency checks. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on
summary statistics for the corresponding Bayes factor to be convergent, namely
to asymptotically select the true model. Those conditions, which amount to the
expectations of the summary statistics to asymptotically differ under both
models, are quite natural and can be exploited in ABC settings to infer whether
or not a choice of summary statistics is appropriate, via a Monte Carlo
validation.

artificially-illuminated objects comparable in total brightness to a major

of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are routinely measured to exquisite precisions of

such objects as a function of their changing orbital distances D.
Sunlight-illuminated objects will show a logarithmic slope alpha=(dlogF/dlog
D)=-4 whereas artificially-illuminated objects should exhibit alpha=-2. Planned
surveys using the proposed LSST will provide superb data that would allow
measurement of alpha for thousands of KBOs. If objects with alpha=-2 are found,
follow-up observations can measure their spectra to determine if they are
illuminated by artificial lighting. The search can be extended beyond the Solar
System with future generations of telescopes on the ground and in space, which
would be capable of detecting phase modulation due to very strong artificial
illumination on the night-side of planets as they orbit their parent stars.

expansion of the universe also true? To be physically useful these propositions
must be falsifiable; that is, subject to observational tests that could render
them false, and both fail when viscous, diffusive, astro-biological and
turbulence effects are included in the interpretation of observations. A more
plausible explanation of negative stresses producing the big bang is turbulence
at Planck temperatures. Inflation results from gluon viscous stresses at the
strong force transition. Anti-gravitational (dark energy) turbulence stresses
are powerful but only temporary. No permanent dark energy is needed. At the
plasma-gas transition, viscous stresses cause fragmentation of plasma
proto-galaxies into dark matter clumps of primordial gas planets, each of which
falsifies dark-energy cold-dark-matter cosmologies. Clumps of these planets
form all stars, and explain the alleged accelerating expansion of the universe
as a systematic dimming error of Supernovae Ia by light scattered in the hot

These variables are barely correlated with variables sensitive to the hard

filtered jet mass and charged multiplicity, over filtered mass alone. Adding

When the star survives disruption, we find its magnetic field amplifies by a

within the tidal debris streams produced in partial disruptions, we find that

in a stream where the magnetic pressure is in equipartition with the gas. Our
results suggest that the returning gas in most (if not all) stellar tidal

that the eventual response of the disk can be highly non-linear, significantly
modifying the formation and longevity of the resulting patterns. Contrary to

black holes in the radiatively inefficient regime show that systems with
sufficient magnetic poloidal flux become magnetically arrested disc (MAD)
systems, with a well-defined relationship between the magnetic flux and the
mass accretion rate. Recently, Zamaninasab (2014) report that the jet magnetic
flux and accretion disc luminosity are tightly correlated over 7 orders of
magnitude for a sample of 76 radio-loud active galaxies, concluding that the
data are explained by the MAD mode of accretion. Their analysis assumes

the MAD relationship found in radiatively inefficient simulations holds at

for MAD systems. Future GRMHD simulations have yet to verify the validity of

Shocks and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible

grounds. We show that shock models are unlikely to account for the jet
emission. In fact, when shocks are efficient at dissipating energy, they
typically do not accelerate particles far beyond the thermal energy, and vice
versa. In contrast, we show that magnetic reconnection can deposit more than
50% of the dissipated energy into non-thermal leptons as long as the energy
density of the magnetic field in the bulk flow is larger than the rest mass
energy density. The emitting region, i.e., the reconnection downstream, is
characterized by a rough energy equipartition between magnetic fields and

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00344v1,Unconscious Gender Bias in Academia: from PhD Students to Professors,"  In an academic landscape where female physicists are still strongly
underrepresented, underlying causes like unconscious gender bias deserve
specific attention. Members of academia are often not aware of their intrinsic,
hence unconscious, biases; this can have negative effects on students and staff
at all career levels. At the Queen's University Belfast, I have developed and
conducted a workshop on unconscious gender bias awareness at the School of
Mathematics and Physics. The first installment of the workshop was attended by
63 members of the School, among them 26 academic staff (lecturer level and
above). Participants attended an informational talk followed by a discussion
session, and then took part in the Harvard Implicit Association Test for
association of gender with science. The participants self-reported their
results and their previous expectations, followed by a group discussion. Here I
present the observed magnitude of unconscious gender bias and summarise the
discussion points of the participants. The outcomes that bias can have on the
success of physics students as well as the careers of physicists in an academic
context will be highlighted. Putting the results into context, I discuss steps
forward to make physics a level playing field for all genders.

5-yr dip around 1900 found from its 100 yr DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky

dust production and dispersion process observed in R Coronae Borealis (RCB)

probably related to the accretion disk surrounding the F star. The slow fading
in KU Cyg is probably caused by increases in dust extinction in the disk, and
the subsequent quick brightening may be due to the evaporation of dust
transported inwards through the disk. The extinction excess which caused the
fading may arise from increased mass transfer rate in the system, or from dust
clump ejections from the K giant.

use today. However, their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical
applications, especially when conditions in training may differ from those in
practice. Recent efforts to develop explanations for neural networks and
machine learning models more generally have produced tools to shed light on the
implicit rules behind predictions. These tools can help us identify when models
are right for the wrong reasons. However, they do not always scale to
explaining predictions for entire datasets, are not always at the right level
of abstraction, and most importantly cannot correct the problems they reveal.
In this thesis, we explore the possibility of training machine learning models
(with a particular focus on neural networks) using explanations themselves. We
consider approaches where models are penalized not only for making incorrect
predictions but also for providing explanations that are either inconsistent
with domain knowledge or overly complex. These methods let us train models
which can not only provide more interpretable rationales for their predictions
but also generalize better when training data is confounded or meaningfully
different from test data (even adversarially so).

http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00611v2,The Past Hypothesis and the Nature of Physical Laws,"  If the Past Hypothesis underlies the arrows of time, what is the status of
the Past Hypothesis? In this paper, I examine the role of the Past Hypothesis
in the Boltzmannian account and defend the view that the Past Hypothesis is a
candidate fundamental law of nature. Such a view is known to be compatible with
Humeanism about laws, but as I argue it is also supported by a minimal
non-Humean ""governing"" view. Some worries arise from the non-dynamical and
time-dependent character of the Past Hypothesis as a boundary condition, the
intrinsic vagueness in its specification, and the nature of the initial
probability distribution. I show that these worries do not have much force, and
in any case they become less relevant in a new quantum framework for analyzing
time's arrows -- the Wentaculus. Hence, the view that the Past Hypothesis is a
candidate fundamental law should be more widely accepted than it is now.

2D quantum nanowake effect, already in the adiabatic limit. We establish that
the SQ are $\pi$-shifted in perturbation theory, because they involve quantum
mechanical exchange of a quasiparticle among two Cooper pairs. It is shown for

z=0.359. Source CXOCJ100043.1+020637 (CID-42) presents two compact optical
sources embedded in the same galaxy. The distance between the 2, measured in
the HST/ACS image, is 0.495"" that, at the redshift of the source, corresponds
to a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset
between the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three
different optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments.
CID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong
redshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an
inverted P-Cygni profile. The Chandra and XMM data show that the absorption
line is variable in energy by 500 eV over 4 years and that the absorber has to
be highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft X-ray
spectrum. That these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be a
coincidence. We envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational wave
recoiling black hole (BH), caught 1-10 Myr after merging, (2) a Type 1/ Type 2
system in the same galaxy where the Type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effect
produced by a triple BH system. The first possibility gives us a candidate
gravitational waves recoiling BH with both spectroscopic and imaging
signatures. In the second case, the X-ray absorption line can be explained as a
BAL-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a Type 2 AGN) at the rearer one
(a Type 1 AGN), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving us
the first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured AGN.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12279v1,"Fine-Grained, Language-Based Access Control for Database-Backed
  Applications","  Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority
than necessary. Since programs can access more data than they legitimately
need, flaws in security checks at the application level can enable malicious or
buggy code to view or modify data in violation of intended access control
policies.
  Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access
to data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often
have many users and consist of many different software components. First,
databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user
for each application user is impractical for applications with many users.
Second, different components of the same application may require different
authority, which would require creating different database users for different
software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly
limit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason,
we consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database
security.
  Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications
with least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts,
which we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications.
  Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of
ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB
enables reasoning about database access at the language level through
capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and
contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables.
ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy
to specify different access control policies for different components.
Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are
enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access
control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms
of the underlying database management system.
  Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to
implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts
for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB.
Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better
understand the language's performance overhead.
  Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for
enforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user
applications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers
to reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and
reuse third-party components with their own application-specific database
security policies.

perturbed to reveal, if sufficiently well-sampled, the presence of a compact
dark companion of Jovian mass orbiting a primary. The likelihood of occurrence
of perturbed lightcurves must also be taken into account by systematic search
programs, to improve their event detection efficiency. The statistics of
perturbed lensing events, if carefully interpreted, could yield estimates of
the incidence of binary systems with low mass ratios, including that of systems
with planets.

published results for the particular case of a flat Harrison-Zel'dovich
spectrum. Our value for the kurtosis compares well with previous analyses but
falls below the threshold imposed by the cosmic variance when commonly accepted

  Quasar Redshift","  Groups and clusters of galaxies hosting a quasar can be found through the
detection of Lyman-alpha absorption lines beyond the quasar redshift. The
effect occurs whenever the distortion to the redshift distribution of
Lyman-alpha clouds induced by the cluster potential extends beyond the
proximity effect of the quasar. Based on CDM cosmological models for the
evolution of structure, we predict the probability for finding lines beyond the
quasar redshift ($z_{abs}>z_Q$) under the assumption that the physical
properties of Lyman-alpha clouds are not affected by flows on large scales (1
Mpc and more) in the quasi-linear regime. If quasars randomly sample the
underlying galaxy distribution, the expected number of lines with $z_{abs}>z_Q$
per quasar can be as high as 0.25[(dN/dz)/350] at $z=2$, where $dN/dz$ is the
number of Lyman-alpha lines per unit redshift far from the quasar. The
probability is enhanced if quasars typically reside in small groups of
galaxies. A statistical excess of Lyman-alpha lines is expected near very dim
quasars or around metal absorption systems. Due to clustering, the standard
approach to the proximity effect overestimates the ionizing background flux at
high redshifts by up to a factor of 3. This result weakens the discrepancy
between the deduced background flux and the contribution from known populations
of quasars.

optically thin to pair production by photon-photon collisions in order to
produce the observed nonthermal spectra. We derive probability distributions
for the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum
baryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on
254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of
the bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the
curvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the
requirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently
small to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,
we discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight
bright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose
positional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity
function of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host
galaxy. This probability tends to increase as the width of the GRB luminosity
function increases. However, the allowed width of the GRB luminosity function
is restricted by the number-count statistics of the bursts.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9505078v1,GRAVITATIONAL LENSING OF QUASARS BY THEIR DAMPED LYMAN-ALPHA ABSORBERS,"  Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers are believed to be associated with galactic
disks. We show that gravitational lensing can therefore affect the statistics
of these systems. First, the magnification bias due to lensing raises faint
QSOs above a given magnitude threshold and thereby enhances the probability for
observing damped absorption systems. Second, the bending of light rays from the
source effectively limits the minimum impact parameter of the line-of-sight
relative to the center of the absorber, thus providing an upper cut-off to the
observed neutral hydrogen (HI) column density. The combination of these effects
yields a pronounced peak in the observed abundance of absorbers with high
column densities (>2*10^{21} cm^{-2}) and low redshifts (z<1). The inferred
value of the cosmological density parameter of neutral hydrogen, Omega_{HI},
increases with increasing redshift and luminosity of the sources even if the
true HI density remains constant. This trend resembles the observed evolution
of Omega_{HI}(z). Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers with column densities >10^{21}
cm^{-2} and redshifts 0.5<z<1 are reliable flags for lensed QSOs with a close
pair of images separated by 0.3 arcsec. Detection of these gravitational
lensing signatures with the Hubble Space Telescope can be used to constrain the

the cosmological Jeans mass (10^5 solar masses). We follow the growth of
isolated spherically symmetric density peaks starting from the linear
perturbative regime. The initial parameters correspond to density peaks of
various widths and heights in a Cold Dark Matter cosmology. We use a
one-dimensional spherical Lagrangian hydrodynamics code to follow the
dynamical, thermal, and non-equilibrium chemical evolution of the gas. The
system includes a collisionless dark matter component and a baryonic component
composed of the nine species H, H^-, H^+, He, He^+, He^{++}, H_2, H_2^+, and
e^-. All relevant chemical reactions between these species and their cooling
mechanisms are included in the calculations. We find that radiative cooling by
H_2 affects the collapse dynamics of the gas only after it has already
virialized and become part of the bound object. Therefore, radiative cooling is
unlikely to have triggered the initial collapse of perturbations at redshifts
z>10. Nevertheless, objects with baryonic masses well below the linear-theory
Jeans mass (<10^3 solar masses) collapse due to shell crossing by the dark
matter. Such objects could be the progenitors of a primordial population of

geometry of the Universe ($\Omega$), the baryon density, the Hubble constant
($h$), the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$), the number of light neutrinos,
the ionization history, and the amplitudes and spectral indices of the
primordial scalar and tensor perturbation spectra. We review the imprint of
each parameter on the CMB. Assuming only that the primordial perturbations were
adiabatic, we use a covariance-matrix approach to estimate the precision with
which these parameters can be determined by a CMB temperature map as a function
of the fraction of sky mapped, the level of pixel noise, and the angular
resolution. For example, with no prior information about any of the
cosmological parameters, a full-sky CMB map with $0.5^\circ$ angular resolution
and a noise level of 15 $\mu$K per pixel can determine $\Omega$, $h$, and
$\Lambda$ with standard errors of $\pm0.1$ or better, and provide
determinations of other parameters which are inaccessible with traditional
observations. Smaller beam sizes or prior information on some of the other

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9604167v1,The Las Campanas Redshift Survey,"  The Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS) consists of 26418 redshifts of
galaxies selected from a CCD-based catalog obtained in the $R$ band. The survey
covers over 700 square degrees in 6 strips, each 1.5$\arcdeg$ x 80$\arcdeg$,
three each in the North and South galactic caps. The median redshift in the
survey is about 30000 km~s$^{-1}$. Essential features of the galaxy selection
and redshift measurement methods are described and tabulated here. These
details are important for subsequent analysis of the LCRS data. Two dimensional
representations of the redshift distributions reveal many repetitions of voids,
on the scale of about 5000 km~s$^{-1}$, sharply bounded by large walls of
galaxies as seen in nearby surveys. Statistical investigations of the mean
galaxy properties and of clustering on the large scale are reported elsewhere.
These include studies of the luminosity function, power spectrum in two and
three dimensions, correlation function, pairwise velocity distribution,
identification of large scale structures, and a group catalog. The LCRS
redshift catalog will be made available to interested investigators at an
internet web site and in archival form as an Astrophysical Journal CD-ROM.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9608131v5,Measuring Polarization In Cosmic Microwave Background,"  Polarization induced by cosmological scalar perturbations leads to a typical
anisotropy pattern, which can best be analyzed in Fourier domain. This allows
one to unambiguously distinguish cosmological signal of polarization from other
foregrounds and systematics, as well as from polarization induced by non-scalar
perturbations. The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation
power spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise and
foreground residuals. Choice of estimator can significantly improve our
capability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limit
the optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of two
compared to the simplest estimator. If foreground residuals are important then
a different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects from
foregrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. A particular
combination of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ parameters vanishes for scalar induced
polarization, thereby allowing an unambiguous determination of tensor modes.
Theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that one
typically expects a signal at the level of 5-10$\mu$K on small angular scales
and around 1$\mu$K on large scales ($l<200$). Satellite missions should be able
to reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization,
which would help to break the degeneracies in the determination of some of the
cosmological parameters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9610248v1,Gravitational Lensing of the X-Ray Background by Clusters of Galaxies,"  Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies affects the cosmic X-ray
background (XRB) by altering the observed density and flux distribution of
background X-ray sources. At faint detection flux thresholds, the resolved
X-ray sources appear brighter and diluted, while the unresolved component of
the XRB appears dimmer and more anisotropic, due to lensing. The diffuse X-ray
intensity in the outer halos of clusters might be lower than the sky-averaged
XRB, after the subtraction of resolved sources. Detection of the lensing signal
with a wide-field X-ray telescope could probe the mass distribution of a
cluster out to its virialization boundary. In particular, we show that the
lensing signature imprinted on the resolved component of the XRB by the cluster
A1689, should be difficult but possible to detect out to 8' at the 2-4 sigma
level, after 10^6 seconds of observation with the forthcoming AXAF satellite.
The lensing signal is fairly insensitive to the lens redshift in the range
0.1<z<0.6. The amplitude of the lensing signal is however sensitive to the
faint end slope of the number-flux relation for unresolved X-ray sources, and
can thus help constrain models of the XRB. A search for X-ray arcs or arclets
could identify the fraction of all faint sources which originate from extended
emission of distant galaxies. The probability for a 3 sigma detection of an
arclet which is stretched by a factor of about 3 after a 10^6 seconds
observation of A1689 with AXAF, is roughly comparable to the fraction of all
background X-ray sources that have an intrinsic size of order 1''.

  J0045-7319 Binary","  Recent observations of PSR J0045-7319, a radio pulsar in a close eccentric
orbit with a massive B-star companion, indicate that the system's orbital
period is decreasing on a timescale of $\approx 5 \times10^{5}$ years, which is
much shorter than the timescale of $\approx$ 10^9 years given by the standard
theory of tidal dissipation in radiative stars. Observations also provide
strong evidence that the B-star is rotating rapidly, perhaps at nearly its
break up speed. We show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in a star
rotating in the same direction as the orbital motion of its companion (prograde
rotation) with a speed greater than the orbital angular speed of the star at
periastron results in an increase in the orbital period of the binary system
with time. Thus, since the observed time derivative of the orbital period is
large and negative, the B-star in the PSR J0045-7319 binary must have
retrograde rotation if tidal effects are to account for the orbital decay. We
also show that the time scale for the synchronization of the B-star's spin with
the orbital angular speed of the star at periastron is comparable to the
orbital evolution time. From the work of Goldreich and Nicholson (1989) we
therefore expect that the B-star should be rotating differentially, with the
outer layers rotating more slowly than the interior. We show that the
dissipation of the dynamical tide in such a differentially rotating B-star is
enhanced by almost three orders of magnitude leading to an orbital evolution
time for the PSR J0045-7319 Binary that is consistent with the observations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9611028v2,Signatures of Stellar Reionization of the Universe,"  The high ionization level and universal metallicity (1% solar) of the
intergalactic gas at redshifts z<5 implies that nonlinear structure had started
to form in the universe at earlier times than we currently probe. In Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) cosmologies, the first generation of baryonic objects emerges at
redshifts z=10-50. Here we examine the observable consequences of the
possibility that an early generation of stars reionized the universe and
resulted in the observed metallicity of the Lyman-alpha forest. Forthcoming
microwave anisotropy experiments will be sensitive to the damping of
anisotropies caused by scattering off free electrons from the reionization
epoch. For a large range of CDM models with a Scalo stellar mass function, we
find that reionization occurs at a redshift z>10 and damps the amplitude of
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees by a detectable amount, of order
10-25%. However, reionization is substantially delayed if the initial stellar
mass function transformed most of the baryons into low mass stars. In this
case, the mass fraction of pre-galactic stars could be constrained from the
statistics of microlensing events in galactic halos or along lines of sight to
quasars. Deep infrared imaging with future space telescopes (such as SIRTF or
the Next Generation Space Telescope) will be able to detect bright star
clusters at z>5. The cumulative Bremsstrahlung emission from these star
clusters yields a measurable distortion to the spectrum of the microwave
background.

orbit with a massive main sequence B-star companion, indicate that the system's
orbital period is decreasing on a timescale $\sim 5 x 10^{5}$ years (Kaspi et
al. 1996). Timing observations of PSR J0045-7319 also indicate that the B-star
is rotating rapidly, perhaps close to its breakup rotation rate. For rapid
(super-synchronous) prograde rotation of the B-star, tidal dissipation leads to
an increasing orbital period for the binary system, while for retrograde
rotation of any magnitude, the orbital period decreases with time. We show that
if tidal effects are to account for the observed orbital decay of the PSR
J0045-7319 binary, the B-star must have retrograde rotation. This implies that
the supernova that produced the pulsar in this binary system likely had a
dipole anisotropy.
  For a reasonably wide range of retrograde rotation rates, the energy in the
dynamical tide of the B-star needs to be dissipated in about one orbital period
in order to account for the observed orbital evolution time for the PSR
J0045-7319 binary. We show, however, that the radiative dissipation of the
dynamical tide in a rigidly rotating B-star is too inefficient by a factor of
$\approx$ 10$^3$, regardless of the magnitude of the rotation rate. We describe
how, when the surface of the B-star is rotating nearly synchronously (which is
expected from the work of Goldreich and Nicholson, 1989), the energy in the
dynamical tide is dissipated in less than an orbital period, thus reconciling
the theoretical and observed rates of orbital evolution.

the progenitors of present-day disk galaxies. We examine the probability for
microlensing of background quasars by stars in their DLAs. Microlensing by an
individual star should magnify the continuum but not the broad emission lines
of the quasars. Consequently, the equivalent width distribution of microlensed
quasars would be distorted. We model a representative spiral galaxy as a closed
system composed of a bulge, a disk, and a halo, and evolve the mass fraction of
stars in the disk based on the observed metallicity of DLAs at high redshifts.
The microlensing signatures are stronger if the halo of the galaxy is made of
Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). In this case, the distortion imprinted
by microlensing on the equivalent width distribution of quasar emission lines
can be detected with high significance in a sample of about 10 DLAs with HI
column densities N>10^21 cm^-2 and absorption redshifts z_abs<1. About a tenth
of all quasars with DLAs (N>10^20 cm^-2) might show excess variability on
timescales shorter than five years. A search for these signals would complement
microlensing searches in local galaxies and calibrate the MACHO mass fraction

using the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and the Faint Object
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. S1040 is a single-lined
spectroscopic binary with a 42.8d period that occupies a ""red straggler""
position in the M67 color-magnitude diagram (CMD), 0.2 mag blueward of the
giant branch. A detection of S1040 at 1620 A with the Ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope provided evidence that the secondary is a hot white dwarf, and thus
that the anomalous location of S1040 in the CMD is likely due to a prior
episode of mass-transfer. Our GHRS spectrum shows a broad Ly alpha absorption
profile that confirms the white dwarf identification of the S1040 secondary. A
model atmosphere fit to the GHRS spectrum yields Teff = 16,160 K, log g = 6.7,
and a mass of 0.22 Msun, for an assumed cluster distance of 820 pc and
reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02. The unusually low mass derived for the white dwarf
implies that it must have a helium core, and that a mass-transfer episode must
have begun while the progenitor was on the lower giant branch. We construct a
plausible mass-transfer history for S1040 in which it originated as a short

  Damped Ly-alpha Absorbers","  We use the existing catalog of Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) systems to place
constraints on the amount of evolution in the baryonic content of galaxies and
on the value of the cosmological constant. The density of cold gas at redshifts
z=3+-1 is obtained from the mean HI column density of DLAs per cosmological
path length. This path length per unit redshift is in turn a sensitive function
of the vacuum density parameter, Omega_v. We compare the total inferred mass of
cold gas at high redshifts to that observed in stars today for flat
cosmologies. We define ""eta"" to be net fraction of the baryonic content of
local galaxies which was expelled since z=3, and use Bayesian inference to
derive confidence regions in the (eta, Omega_v) plane. In all cosmologies we
find that eta<0.4 with at least 95% confidence if <25% of the current stellar
population formed before z=3. The most likely value of eta is negative,
implying a net increase by several tens of percent in the baryonic mass of
galaxies since z=3+-1. On the other hand, recent observations of high metal
abundances in the intracluster medium of rich clusters (Loewenstein & Mushotzky
1996) require that metal-rich gas be expelled from galaxies in an amount
approximately equal to the current mass in stars. Based on our results and the
low metallicity observed in DLAs at z>2, we infer that more than half of the
baryonic mass processed through galaxies must have been assembled and partly
expelled from galaxies after z=2. We expect our constraints to improve
considerably as the size of the DLA sample will increase with the forthcoming

  Depletion in Dwarf Components","  We present an extensive study of lithium abundances in dwarf components of
chromospherically active binary stars (CABS). Since most of these binaries have
known radii, masses and ages, this kind of data is especially useful for
comparisons with theoretical models which try to explain the Li depletion
phenomenon. We show that a significant part of these stars have clear Li
overabundances. These excesses are evident when comparing our sample of CABS

namely Pleiades, Hyades, NGC752, M67 and NGC188. The Li excesses are more
conspicuous for masses in the range 0.75-0.95 Mo, indicating that the rate of
Li depletion has been less pronounced in CABS than in single stars. This
phenomenon is interpreted in the context of transport of angular momentum from
the orbit to the stellar rotation due to tidal effects. Other explanations,
however, can not be ruled out. This is the case of transport of material
induced by internal gravity waves, which could be inhibited due to the presence
of strong magnetic fields associated with the effective dynamo in CABS. The
confirmed existence of a relation between Li and fluxes in CaII H&K lines can
also be accommodated within both scenarios.

cosmic-variance limit to detecting a small tensor signal with only a
temperature map. Here we assess the detectability of a gravity-wave background

$10-20 \mu K \sqrt{sec}$, the sensitivity to a tensor signal is always
dominated by the polarization map. With a detector sensitivity of order $1 \mu
K \sqrt{sec}$, polarization could improve on a temperature-map sensitivity to
tensor modes by two to three orders of magnitude. Even a small amount of
reionization substantially enhances tensor-mode detectability. We also argue
that the sensitivity of the Planck Surveyor to tensor modes is significantly
improved with polarization, even taking into account the resulting degradation

We consider three models in order to assess the non-repeating, narrowband
events found in recent SETI and to analyze large surveys in general: (I)
Radiometer noise; (II) A population of constant Galactic sources undergoing
interstellar scintillation,; and (III) Real, transient signals (or hardware

low-luminosity quasars at high redshifts in a LambdaCDM cosmology. We derive
the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at fainter luminosities and
higher redshifts than currently detected, based on three assumptions: (1) the
formation of dark-matter halos follows the Press-Schechter theory, (2) the
ratio of central black hole mass to halo mass is the same for all halos, and
(3) the light-curve of quasars, in Eddington units, is universal. We show that
a universal light-curve provides an excellent fit to the observed quasar
luminosity function at redshifts 2.6 < z < 4.5. By extrapolating the evolution
of this luminosity function to higher redshifts (4.5 < z < 20), we find that
the associated early population of low-luminosity quasars reionizes the
universe around redshift z=12. The reprocessing of the UV light of these
quasars by dust from early type II supernovae, distorts the microwave
background spectrum by a Compton y-parameter, y = 1e-5, comparable to the upper
limit set by COBE. The Next Generation Space Telescope could detect tens of

  In the Kuiper Belt, simulations without velocity evolution produce a single
runaway body with a radius of 1000 km on a time scale inversely proportional to
the initial mass in the annulus. Runaway growth occurs in 100 Myr for 10 earth
masses and an initial eccentricity of 0.001 in a 6 AU annulus centered at 35
AU. This mass is close to the amount of dusty material expected in a minimum
mass solar nebula extrapolated into the Kuiper Belt.
  Simulations with velocity evolution produce runaway growth on a wide range of
time scales. Dynamical friction and viscous stirring increase particle
velocities in models with large (8 km radius) initial bodies. This velocity
increase delays runaway growth by a factor of two compared to models without
velocity evolution. In contrast, collisional damping dominates over dynamical
friction and viscous stirring in models with small (80--800 m radius) initial
bodies. Collisional damping decreases the time scale to runaway growth by
factors of 4--10 relative to constant velocity calculations. Simulations with
minimum mass solar nebulae, 10 earth masses, reach runaway growth on time
scales of 20-40 Myr with 80 m initial bodies, 50-100 Myr with 800 m bodies, and

the distribution of their number as a function of Gamma-ray flux implies that
they occur once per (0.3-40) million years per bright galaxy and that they
deposit >10^{53} ergs into their surrounding interstellar medium. The blast
wave generated by a GRB explosion would be washed out by interstellar
turbulence only after tens of millions of years when it finally slows down to a
velocity of 10 km/s. This rather long lifetime implies that there could be up
to several tens of active GRB remnants in each galaxy at any given time. For
many years, radio observations have revealed the enigmatic presence of
expanding neutral-hydrogen (HI) supershells of kpc radius in the Milky Way and
in other nearby galaxies. The properties of some supershells cannot be easily
explained in terms of conventional sources such as stellar winds or supernova
explosions. However, the inferred energy and frequency of the explosions
required to produce most of the observed supershells agree with the above GRB
parameters. More careful observations and analysis might reveal which fraction
of these supershells are GRB remnants. We show that if this link is

scattered width exceeds the intrinsic width of the quasar lines and hence can
be used to measure the virial temperature of the quasar host. The high degree
of polarization of the scattered radiation can help filter out the extended
scattered light from the central emission by the quasar and its host galaxy.
The signal-to-noise ratio of the spectral broadening can be enhanced by
matching the full spectrum of the scattered radiation to a template of the
unscattered quasar spectrum. Although the central fuzz around low-redshift
quasars is dominated by starlight, the fuzz around high-redshift quasars might
be dominated by scattering before galaxies have converted most of their gas
reservoirs into stars.

  Cluster NGC 6397","  We present evidence that the globular cluster NGC 6397 contains two distinct
classes of centrally-concentrated UV-bright stars. Color-magnitude diagrams
constructed from U, B, V, and I data obtained with the HST/WFPC2 reveal seven
UV-bright stars fainter than the main-sequence turnoff, three of which had
previously been identified as cataclysmic variables (CVs). Lightcurves of these
stars show the characteristic ``flicker'' of CVs, as well as longer-term
variability. A fourth star is identified as a CV candidate on the basis of its
variability and UV excess. Three additional UV-bright stars show no photometric
variability and have broad-band colors characteristic of B stars. These
non-flickering UV stars are too faint to be extended horizontal branch stars.
We suggest that they could be low-mass helium white dwarfs, formed when the
evolution of a red giant is interrupted, due either to Roche-lobe overflow onto
a binary companion, or to envelope ejection following a common-envelope phase
in a tidal-capture binary. Alternatively, they could be very-low-mass
core-He-burning stars. Both the CVs and the new class of faint UV stars are
strongly concentrated toward the cluster center, to the extent that mass
segregation from 2-body relaxation alone may be unable to explain their
distribution.

to study simultaneously the X-ray (2-20 keV) and hard X-ray components (E>20

``Island'' state characterized by a hard Comptomized spectrum with an electron
temperature kTe~29 keV, an optical depth of 2.9 (spherical geometry) and a
temperature for the ``seed'' photons of 1.2 keV. Below 5 keV, there is a soft
excess which we fit with a blackbody of kTbb=0.7 keV. The Comptonization
temperature is significantly lower those observed for black holes candidates in
their low luminosity states (kTe >~ 50 keV). Finally, our observation allows us
to associate the presence of an hard tail with a low luminosity X-ray state
(1-20 keV luminosity of 10^37 erg/s at 7.7 kpc).

background of ionizing radiation. By that time a significant fraction of the
cosmic gas had already been incorporated into collapsed galactic halos with
virial temperatures below about 10000 K that were unable to cool efficiently.
We show that photoionization of this gas by the fresh cosmic UV background
boiled the gas out of the gravitational potential wells of its host halos. We
calculate the photoionization heating of gas inside spherically symmetric dark
matter halos, and assume that gas which is heated above its virial temperature
is expelled. In popular Cold Dark Matter models, the Press-Schechter halo
abundance implies that about 50-90% of the collapsed gas was evaporated at
reionization. The gas originated from halos below a threshold circular velocity
of 10-15 km/s. The resulting outflows from the dwarf galaxy population at
redshifts 5-10 affected the metallicity, thermal and hydrodynamic state of the
surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results suggest that stellar systems with
a velocity dispersion below about 10 km/s, such as globular clusters or the
dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group, did not form directly through
cosmological collapse at high redshifts.

Most of the cores listed in the catalogue have diameters between $0.05 - 0.36$

spherical (mean aspect ratio: $\sim 2.4$). The ratio of the number of cores
with EYSOs to the number of starless cores for our sample is about 0.3,

strongly absorbed shortward of their rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength by
neutral hydrogen (HI) in the intervening intergalactic medium. However, the
Lyman-alpha line photons emitted by these sources are not eliminated but rather
scatter until they redshift out of resonance and escape due to the Hubble
expansion of the surrounding intergalactic HI. We calculate the resulting
brightness distribution and the spectral shape of the diffuse Lyman-alpha line
emission around high redshift sources, before the intergalactic medium was
reionized. Typically, the Lyman-alpha photons emitted by a source at z=10
scatter over a characteristic angular radius of order 15 arcseconds around the
source and compose a line which is broadened and redshifted by about a thousand
km/s relative to the source. The scattered photons are highly polarized.
Detection of the diffuse Lyman-alpha halos around high redshift sources would
provide a unique tool for probing the neutral intergalactic medium before the
epoch of reionization. On sufficiently large scales where the Hubble flow is
smooth and the gas is neutral, the Lyman-alpha brightness distribution can be
used to determine the cosmological mass densities of baryons and matter.

other turbulent inputs. The structures which form reproduce well observed

gravitationally-bound structures by turbulent compression are summarized. For
flows with equations of state $P\propto \rho^\gamma$, the statistics of the
density field depend on the exponent $\gamma$. Numerical simulations of both
forced and decaying MHD compressible turbulence have shown that the decay rate
is comparable to the non-magnetic case. For virialized clouds, the turbulent
decay time is shorter than the gravitational free-fall time, so wholesale cloud
collapse is only prevented by ongoing turbulent inputs and/or a strong mean

discussed.

coefficients and the role of boundary conditions in interpreting whether
numerical evidence for suppression is dynamical. If a uniform field in a
periodic box serves as the initial condition for modeling the backreaction on
the turbulent EMF, then the magnitude of the turbulent EMF and thus the dynamo
coefficient $\a$, have a stringent upper limit that depends on the magnetic
Reynolds number $R_M$ to a power of order -1. This is not a dynamic suppression
but results just because of the imposed boundary conditions. In contrast, when
mean field gradients are allowed within the simulation region, or non-periodic
boundary are used, the upper limit is independent of $R_M$ and takes its
kinematic value. Thus only for simulations of the latter types could a measured
suppression be the result of a dynamic backreaction. This is fundamental for
understanding a long-standing controversy surrounding $\alpha$ suppression.
Numerical simulations which do not allow any field gradients and invoke
periodic boundary conditions appear to show a strong $\alpha$ suppression (e.g.
Cattaneo & Hughes 1996). Simulations of accretion discs which allow field
gradients and allow free boundary conditions (Brandenburg & Donner 1997)
suggest a dynamo $\alpha$ which is not suppressed by a power of $R_M$. Our
results are consistent with both types of simulations.

independently imply that at z < 0.5 the gas in the universe has substantial
average metallicity: 1/10 < Z/Z_solar < 1/3 for Omega_gas = 0.05. This metal
density probably cannot be contained in known solar-metallicity galaxies of
density parameter Omega_star ~ 0.004, implying significant enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) by ejection of metals and dust from galaxies via
winds, in mergers or in dust efflux driven by radiation pressure. Galaxies have
a dust/metal ratio of ~ 0.5 in their interstellar media, but some fraction
(1-f) > 0 of this must be destroyed in the IGM or during the ejection process.
Assuming the Draine & Lee dust model and preferential destruction of small
grains, I calculate the reddening and extinction of a uniform cosmological dust
component in terms of (f) and the minimum grain size a_min. Very small grains
provide most of the reddening but less than half of the opacity for optical
extinction. For f > 0.3 and a_min > 0.1 microns, the intergalactic dust would
be too grey to have been detected by its reddening, yet dense enough to be
cosmologically important: it could account for the recently observed type Ia
supernova dimming at z ~ 0.5 without cosmic acceleration. The importance of
grey intergalactic dust of the described type can be tested by observations of
z=0.5 supernovae in (rest) R-band or longer wavelengths and by the fluxes of a

to detect galactic dark matter objects, and we suggest that the lack of short
period star-microlensing events observed for stars near the Galaxy does not
preclude either the ``rogue planets'' identified from quasar-microlensing by
Schild 1996 as the missing-mass of a lens galaxy, or the clumps of such objects
predicted by the new Gibson 1996-2000 hydro-gravitational theory as the
inner-halo galactic dark matter. We point out that such micro-brown-dwarfs in
nonlinear accretional cascades to form stars give intermittent lognormal number
density n_p distributions. Hence, star-microlensing searches that focus on a
small fraction of the sky and assume a uniform distribution for n_p are subject
to undersampling errors. Sparse independent samples give modes smaller than
means of the highly skewed lognormal distributions expected.
Quasar-microlensing searches with higher optical depths are less affected by
intermittency. We attempt to reconcile the results of the star-microlensing and
quasar-microlensing studies. We conclude that star microlensing searches cannot
exclude and are unlikely to even detect these objects so easily observed by
quasar-microlensing and so robustly predicted by the new theory.

MECS spectrum obtained during this observation, which are consistent with the
interpretation that the source had switched off, leaving only the spectrum of
pure reflection from distant cold matter. We place this result in context by
showing the X-ray lightcurve of NGC4051 obtained by our RXTE monitoring
campaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low state
lasted for ~150 days before the May observations (implying that the reflecting
material is > 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of a
lightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux over
timescales > months. We show that the long-timescale component to X-ray
variability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct from
the variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations in
the accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. As the source
approaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. NGC4051
may represent a microcosm of all X-ray variability in radio quiet active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), displaying in a few years a variety of flux states and
variability properties which more luminous AGNs may pass through on timescales

During source-transit events spots can cause deviations larger than 2%, and
thus be in principle detectable. Maximum relative deviation usually occurs when
the lens directly crosses the spot. Its numerical value for a dark spot with
sufficient contrast is found to be roughly equal to the fractional radius of
the spot, i.e., up to 20% in this study. Spots can also be efficiently detected
by the changes in sensitive spectral lines during the event. Notably, the
presence of a spot can mimic the effect of a low-mass companion of the lens in

the majority of the observational constraints, at least for the case of a
constant IMF. Different variable IMFs are tested with this model, all assuming
that massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity.
This implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and at
large galactocentric distances. Our numerical results have shown that all the
variable IMFs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevant
observational constraints in the Galaxy and that a constant IMF still
reproduces better the observations. In particular, variable IMFs of the kind
explored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients even
when allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as, for
instance, the star formation rate. As a consequence of this we conclude that
the G-dwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large
timescale and a constant IMF, since it is possible to find variable IMFs of the
kind studied here, reproducing the G-dwarf metallicity but this worsen the

empirical calibrations of extinction curves, but rather on the lifetime of
molecular clouds which delays the emergence of each successive generation of

multi-temperature blackbody disk and a power-law component. We find that the
QPO frequency and amplitude are well correlated with the spectral parameters,
although the correlations found for XTE J1550-564 are generally opposite to
those for GRO J1655-40. There is one exeption: Both sources exhibit a general
increase in the QPO frequency as the disk flux increases (or as the mass
accretion rate through the disk increases). In addition, these QPOs are
observed only when the power-law component contributes more than 20% of the
2-20 keV flux, which indicates that both the disk and the power-law components
are linked to the QPO phenomenon.

to the simulation results of Evrard et al. (1996) that are frequently used for
mass-temperature scaling. The higher-temperature subsample (kT > 4 keV) is
consistent with M propto T^{3/2}, allowing the possibility that the

supernovae that is more important for low-temperature groups and galaxies as
suggested by earlier works.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9912241v2,Theoretical Transmission Spectra During Extrasolar Giant Planet Transits,"  The recent transit observation of HD 209458 b - an extrasolar planet orbiting
a sun-like star - confirmed that it is a gas giant and determined that its
orbital inclination is 85 degrees. This inclination makes possible
investigations of the planet atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the planet
transmission spectra during a transit. The basic tenet of the method is that
the planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar
flux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb.
The ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is
small, approximately 10^{-3} to 10^{-4}; for this method to work very strong
planet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in
extrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the
alkali metal lines, in particular the Na I and K I resonance doublets, and the
He I $2^3S$ - $2^3P$ triplet line at 1083.0 nm. If successful, observations
will constrain the line-of-sight temperature, pressure, and density. The most
important point is that observations will constrain the cloud depth, which in
turn will distinguish between different atmosphere models. We also discuss the
potential of this method for EGPs at different orbital distances and orbiting
non-solar-type stars.

Hubble Deep Field. The system consists of a source galaxy lensed into an arc,
0.9 arcseconds from an elliptical galaxy with an implied mass-to-light ratio of
order 15 in solar units. This lens system may be a preview of the large number
of lensed high-redshift galaxies that will be detected with the Next Generation
Space Telescope (NGST). Popular models of structure formation imply that
roughly 3% of observed sources at z>5 should be multiply imaged. Thus, NGST
should detect several lensed objects in each field of view. In addition, NGST
will be a valuable tool for weak lensing measurements if it can resolve the
background galaxies. We estimate the angular size distribution of high redshift
sources within hierarchical models of structure formation and find that most
will be resolved. (abridged)

Group. Although we briefly describe the globular cluster systems of the
individual Local Group galaxies, the main thrust of our paper is to examine the
collective properties. In this way we are simulating the dissipationless merger

known early type galaxies. Based on our results, we briefly speculate on the

intergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to be
intimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. In
particular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial IMF
are of special interest. We present results from high resolution
three--dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the
collapse of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation
within a cosmologically representative volume. Comoving scales from 128 kpc
down to 1 pc are followed accurately. Dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and
all relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followed
self-consistently for a cluster normalized CDM structure formation model.
Primordial molecular clouds with ~10^5 solar masses are assembled by mergers of
multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with a
fractional abundance of ~10^-4. As the subclumps merge cooling lowers the
temperature to ~200 Kelvin in a `cold pocket' at the center of the halo. Within
this cold pocket, a quasi-hydrostatically contracting core with ~200 solar mass
and number densities > 10^5 cm^-3 is found. We find that less than 1% of the
primordial gas in such small scale structures cools and collapses to
sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star formation.
Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that this study achieved the highest
dynamic range covered by structured adaptive mesh techniques in cosmological
hydrodynamics to date.

  galaxies","  The radio emission from supermassive black holes in nearby early-type
galaxies can be used to test possible explanations for their low luminosities.
We calculate the expected contribution from thermal synchrotron emission from
hot accretion flows to the high radio frequency observations of NGC 2300, NGC
1399, NGC 4278 and NGC 4594. We find that, in all cases, and in accordance with
our previous findings, hot flows accreting close to their Bondi rates
overestimate significantly the observed fluxes. This implies that simply
assuming a low radiative efficiency for the accreting gas is not enough to
explain their low luminosities. Smaller central densities and accretion rates,
as expected in the presence of strong mass loss or convection in the flows, can
help reconcile the models with observations. We also show that a significant
contribution to the high-frequency radio spectra can be due to non-thermal
synchrotron emission from the small scale radio jets observed in these systems,
allowing for even lower accretion rates in the inflows. We suggest that these
outflows or jets may dump significant energy into the surronding medium close
to the accretion radius and so reduce the accretion rates onto these systems.
We discuss the relationship between the radio flux and black hole mass for the
observed sample and its potential importance for probing accretion models.

provides a reasonable fit to the observed quasar luminosity function at
redshifts higher than ~2.0. We suggest that the disagreement at lower redshift

variabilities (up to 300% peak-to-peak) in a sample of nearby low-luminosity

could be related to the activity of nuclear jets responding to changing

this paper are: i) the normalization of the SCF based on an analytic model for
the effect of noise; ii) the computation of the SCF as a function of the
spatial lag between spectra within a map. By computing of the dependence of the
SCF on the spatial lag, S_o(dr), we have been able to conclude that: 1) S_o(dr)
is a power law, with slope in the range of scales l_i-l_o. 2) The correlation
outer scale, l_o, is determined by the size of the map, and no evidence for a
true departure from self-similarity on large scales has been found. 3) The
correlation inner scale, l_i, is a true estimate of the smallest self-similar
scale in a map. 4) The spectral slope in a given region, is independent of
velocity resolution (above a minimum resolution threshold), spatial resolution,
and average spectrum quality. 5) Molecular transitions which trace higher gas
density yield larger values of the spectral slope than transitions tracing
lower gas density. 6) Nyquist sampling, bad pixels in detector arrays, and
reference sharing data acquisition need to be taken into account for a correct
determination of the SCF at lag dr=1. The value of the spectral slope, however,
can be computed correctly without a detailed knowledge of observational
procedures.

with a surface. We assume Coulomb coupling between the protons and electrons,
and free-free cooling from the electrons. Outside a thin boundary layer, where
the accretion flow meets the star, we show that there is an extended settling
region which is well-described by two self-similar solutions: (1) a
two-temperature solution which is valid in an inner zone $r\le10^{2.5}$ ($r$ is
in Schwarzchild units), and (2) a one-temperature solution at larger radii. In
both zones, $\rho\propto r^{-2}, \Omega\propto r^{-3/2}, v\propto r^0,\
T_p\propto r^{-1}$; in the two-temperature zone, $T_e\propto r^{-1/2}$. The
luminosity of the settling zone arises from the rotational energy of the star
as the star is braked by viscosity; hence the luminosity is independent of
$\dot M$. The settling solution is convectively and viscously stable and is
unlikely to have strong winds or outflows. The flow is thermally unstable, but
the instability may be stabilized by thermal conduction. The settling solution
described here is not advection-dominated, and is thus different from the
self-similar ADAF found around black holes. When the spin of the star is small
enough, however, the present solution transforms smoothly to a (settling) ADAF.

correlation between the P-L dispersion and host galaxy metallicity which is
significant at the ~3sigma level in the V band. This result supports the
suggestion that the metallicity dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation may be
stronger than expected. The high observed dispersions in the HST Cepheid P-L
relations have the further consequence that the bias due to incompleteness in
the P-L relation at faint magnitudes is more significant than previously
thought. In the HST sample, galaxies at higher distance tend to have higher
metallicity. This means that when a full metallicity/incompleteness correction
is made, a scale error in the published Cepheid distances is seen in the sense
that the published distance moduli are increasingly underestimates at larger
distances. This results in the average distance modulus to the four galaxies in
the Virgo cluster core increasing from (m-M)_0=31.2+-0.19 to (m-M)_0=31.8+-0.17
with similar increases for the Fornax and Ursa Major clusters. For the 18 HST

previous Pierce & Tully TF estimate of H_0=85 reducing to H_0=58+-7. Finally,
for the 8 HST galaxies with SNIa, the metallicity corrected Cepheid distances
now imply a metallicity dependence of SNIa peak luminosity in the sense that
metal-poor hosts have lower luminosity SNIa. Thus SNIa Hubble diagram estimates
of both H_0 and q_0 may also require significant metallicity corrections.

modified Planckian shapes due to the photon-energy dependence of the magnetic
opacities. However, vacuum polarization significantly modifies the spectra for
B~10^15 G, giving rise to power-law tails at high photon energies. The
angle-dependence (beaming) of the emerging intensity has two maxima: a narrow
(pencil) peak at small angles (<5 degrees) with respect to the normal and a
broad maximum (fan beam) at intermediate angles (~20-60 degrees). The relative
importance and the opening angle of the radial beam decreases strongly with
increasing magnetic field strength and decreasing photon energy. We finally
compute a T_eff-T_c relation for our models, where T_c is the local color
temperature of the spectrum emerging from the neutron star surface, and find
that T_c/T_eff ranges between 1.1-1.8. We discuss the implications of our

the presence of an ultramagnetized neutron star, or ``magnetar'', with B on the

have analyzed archival ASCA data for several known AXPs and SGRs, and fitted
them with a model in which all or part of the X-ray flux originates as thermal
emission from a magnetar. Our magnetar spectral model includes the effects of
the anisotropy of the heat flow through an ultramagnetized neutron star
envelope, reprocessing by a light element atmosphere, and general relativistic
corrections to the observed spectrum. We obtain good fits to the data with
radii for the emitting areas which are generally consistent with those expected
for neutron stars, in contrast to blackbody (BB) fits, which imply much smaller
radii. Furthermore, the inclusion of atmospheric effects results in inferred
temperatures which are lower than those implied by BB fits, but however still
too high to be accounted by thermal cooling alone. An extra source of heating
(possibly due to magnetic field decay) is needed. Despite the harder tail in
the spectrum produced by reprocessing of the outgoing flux through the
atmosphere, spectral fits still require a considerable fraction of the flux to
be in a power-law component.

  and Stability","  We present analytical and numerical solutions which describe a hot, viscous,
two-temperature accretion flow onto a rotating neutron star or any other
rotating compact star with a surface. We assume Coulomb coupling between the
protons and electrons, and free-free cooling from the electrons. Outside a thin
boundary layer, where the accretion flow meets the star, we show that there is
an extended settling region which is well-described by two self-similar
solutions: (i) a two-temperature solution which is valid in an inner zone
$r\le10^{2.5}$ ($r$ is in Schwarzchild units), and (ii) a one-temperature
solution at larger radii. In both zones, $\rho\propto r^{-2}, \Omega\propto
r^{-3/2}, v\propto r^0, T_p\propto r^{-1}$; in the two-temperature zone,
$T_e\propto r^{-1/2}$. The luminosity of the settling zone arises from the
rotational energy of the star as the star is braked by viscosity. Hence the
luminosity and the flow parameters (density, temperature, angular velocity) are
independent of $\dot M$. The settling solution described here is not
advection-dominated, and is thus different from the self-similar ADAF found
around black holes. When the spin of the star is small enough, however, the
present solution transforms smoothly to a (settling) ADAF.
  We carried out a stability analysis of the settling flow. The flow is
convectively and viscously stable and is unlikely to have strong winds or
outflows. Unlike another cooling-dominated system --- the SLE disk, --- the
settling flow is thermally stable provided that thermal conduction is taken
into account. This strong saturated-like thermoconduction does not change the
structure of the flow.

in the standard synchrotron shock model. Garnavich, Loeb & Stanek found that
this deviation was well-fit by an ad hoc model in which a thin ring of emission
is microlensed by an intervening star. We revisit the microlensing
interpretation of this variability, first by testing whether microlensing of
afterglow images with realistic surface brightness profiles (SBPs) can fit the
data, and second by directly inverting the observed light curve to obtain a
non-parametric measurement of the SBP. We find that microlensing of realistic
SBPs can reproduce the observed deviation, provided that the optical emission
arises from frequencies above the cooling break. Conversely, if the variability
is indeed caused by microlensing, the SBP must be significantly
limb-brightened. Specifically, greater than 60% of the flux must originate from
the outer 25% of the area of the afterglow image. The latter requirement is
satisfied by the best fit theoretical SBP. The underlying optical/infrared
afterglow lightcurve is consistent with a model in which a jet is propagating

scattered Lyman-alpha radiation which probes the neutral intergalactic medium

scattered light around a street lamp which is embedded in a dense fog. Outflows
from quasars magnetize the IGM at all redshifts. As a result, the shocks
produced by converging flows during the formation of large scale structure in
the IGM, accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and become visible in
the radio regime through their synchrotron emission and in the gamma-ray regime
through their inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background photons.
During transient episodes of strong mergers, X-ray clusters should therefore
appear as extended radio or gamma-ray sources on the sky.

neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields. The beaming of the radiation
emerging from a magnetar was recently shown to be predominantly non-radial,
with a small pencil and a broad fan component. We show that the combination of
this radiation pattern with the effects of strong lensing in the gravitational
field of the neutron star yields pulse profiles that show a qualitatively
different behavior compared to that of the radially-peaked beaming patterns
explored previously. Specifically, we find that: (i) the pulse profiles of
magnetars with a single hot emission region on their surface exhibit 1-2 peaks,
whereas those with an antipodal emission geometry have 1-4 peaks, depending on
the neutron star compactness, the observer's viewing angle, and the size of the
hot regions; (ii) the energy dependence of the beaming pattern may give rise to
weakly or strongly energy-dependent pulse profiles and may introduce phase lags
between different energy bands; (iii) the non-radial beaming pattern can give
rise to high pulsed fractions even for very relativistic neutron stars; (iv)
the pulsed fraction may not vary monotonically with neutron star compactness;
(v) the pulsed fraction does not decrease monotonically with the size of the
emitting region; (vi) the pulsed fraction from a neutron star with a single hot
pole has, in general, a very weak energy dependence, in contrast to the case of
an antipodal geometry. Comparison of these results to the observed properties
of anomalous X-ray pulsars strongly suggests that they are neutron stars with a

background contamination of the observations, image blurring due to instrument
response, and the absorption of photons in space. The resulting highly

summarize the relative frequency of the energy of photons (X-ray or gamma-ray)

to model the counts than the commonly used normal approximation. We model the
high energy tail of the ASCA spectrum of each of the stars as a combination of
a Bremsstrahlung continuum and ten narrow emission lines, included at positions
of known strong lines. Statistical analysis is based on two source observations

to construct a prior for the second. Sensitivity of the final results to the

intrinsic linewidth of the gas exceeds one half of the separation of these
quadrupole hyperfine components (~5-10 km/s) these lines blend together and the
observed linewidths greatly overestimate the intrinsic linewidths. If
uncorrected, these artificially broad linewidths will lead to artificially high
opacities. We have observed this effect in our NH3 data from the central 10 pc

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212456v1,Evolution of Magnetic Fields around a Kerr Black Hole,"  The evolution of magnetic fields frozen to a perfectly conducting plasma
fluid around a Kerr black hole is investigated. We focus on the plunging region
between the black hole horizon and the marginally stable circular orbit in the
equatorial plane. Adopting the kinematic approximation where the dynamical
effects of magnetic fields are ignored, we exactly solve Maxwell's equations
with the assumptions that the geodesic motion of the fluid is stationary and
axisymmetric, the magnetic field has only radial and azimuthal components and
depends only on time and radial coordinates. We show that the stationary state
of the magnetic field in the plunging region is uniquely determined by the
boundary conditions at the marginally stable circular orbit. If the magnetic
field at the marginally stable circular orbit is in a stationary state, the
magnetic field in the plunging region will quickly settle into a stationary
state if it is not so initially, in a time determined by the dynamical time
scale. The radial component of the magnetic field at the marginally stable
circular orbit is more important than the toroidal component in determining the
structure and evolution of the magnetic field in the plunging region. Even if
at the marginally stable circular orbit the toroidal component is zero, in the
plunging region a toroidal component is quickly generated from the radial
component by the shear motion of the fluid. Finally, we show that the dynamical
effects of magnetic fields are unimportant in the plunging region if they are
negligible on the marginally stable circular orbit. This supports the
``no-torque inner boundary condition'' of thin disks, contrary to the claim in
the recent literature.

determine temporal breaks (or limits) from their afterglow light curves. We

incorporating realistic estimates of the ambient density and propagating error
estimates on the measured quantities. In agreement with our previous analysis
of a smaller sample, the derived jet opening angles of those 16 bursts with
redshifts result in a narrow clustering of geometrically-corrected gamma-ray
energies about E_gamma = 1.33e51 erg; the burst-to-burst variance about this
value is a factor of 2.2. Despite this rather small scatter, we demonstrate in
a series of GRB Hubble diagrams, that the current sample cannot place
meaningful constraints upon the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Indeed
for GRBs to ever be useful in cosmographic measurements we argue the necessity
of two directions. First, GRB Hubble diagrams should be based upon fundamental
physical quantities such as energy, rather than empirically-derived and
physically ill-understood distance indicators. Second, a more homogeneous set
should be constructed by culling sub-classes from the larger sample. These
sub-classes, though now first recognizable by deviant energies, ultimately must
be identifiable by properties other than those directly related to energy. We
identify a new sub-class of GRBs (``f-GRBs'') which appear both underluminous

10-20% of observed long-duration bursts appear to be f-GRBs.

connected with active star-formation and since burst emission penetrates dust,
one hope is that with a uniformly-selected sample, the large-scale redshift
distribution of GRBs can help constrain the star-formation history of the
Universe. However, we show that strong observational biases in ground-based
redshift discovery hamper a clean determination of the large-scale GRB rate and
hence the connection of GRBs to the star formation history. We then focus on
the properties of the small-scale (clustering) distribution of GRB redshifts.
When corrected for heliocentric motion relative to the local Hubble flow, the
observed redshifts appear to show a propensity for clustering: 8 of 26 GRBs
occurred within a recession velocity difference of 1000 km/s of another GRB.
That is, 4 pairs of GRBs occurred within 30 h_65^-1 Myr in cosmic time, despite
being causally separated on the sky. We investigate the significance of this

twenty percent of the simulated datasets (the precise significance of the

light curves of GRBs afterglow are (i) the manifestation of the edge of a jet,
which has a roughly uniform energy profile and a sharp edge and (ii) a line of
sight effect in jets with a variable energy profile. The first scenario
requires the inner engine to produce a jet with a different opening angle each
explosion, while the latter requires a standard engine. The physical structure
of the jet is a crucial factor in understanding GRB progenitors, and therefore
discriminating the two jet scenarios is particularly relevant. In the
structured jet case, specific predictions can be made for the distribution of
observed break angles $\theta_{\rm break}$, while that distribution is
arbitrary in the first scenario. We derive the theoretical distribution for the
structured jet model. Specifically, we predict the most common angle to be
about 0.12 rad, in rough agreement with the sample. If this agreement would
hold as the sample size increases, it would strengthen the case for the
standard jet hypothesis. We show that a prediction of this model is that the
average viewing angle is an increasing function of the survey sensitivity, and
in particular that a mission like {\em Swift} will find the typical viewing
angle to be about 0.3 rad. The local event rate predicted by this model is

to study the evolution of the metal enrichment in quasar hosts and hence
explore the relationship between star/spheroid formation and black hole
growth/activity. We find a steep radial metallicity gradient in quasar host
galaxies, with gas metallicities close to solar values in the outer parts but
becoming supersolar in the center. The hosts of the rare bright quasars at
z~5-6 have star formation rates of several hundred solar masses per year and
halo masses of order ~10^12 solar masses. Already at these redshifts they have
supersolar (Z ~2-3 solar) central metallicities, with a mild dependence of
metallicity on luminosity, consistent with observed trends. The mean value of
metallicity is sensitive to the assumed quasar lifetime, providing a useful new
probe of this parameter. We find that lifetimes from 10^7-4x10^7yr are favored
by comparison to observational data. In both the models and observations, the
rate of evolution of the mean quasar metallicity as a function of redshift is
generally flat out to z ~ 4-5. Beyond the observed redshift range and out to

shocked, moderately overdense gas in the IGM. The model is an extension of the
Press & Schechter (1974) description for the mass function of halos: we assume
that large-scale structure shocks occur at a fixed overdensity during nonlinear
collapse. This in turn allows us to compute the fraction of gas at a given
redshift that has been shock-heated to a specified temperature. We show that,
if strong shocks occur at turnaround, our model provides a reasonable
description of the temperature distribution seen in cosmological simulations at
z~0, although it does overestimate the importance of weak shocks. We then apply
our model to shocks at high redshifts. We show that, before reionization, the
thermal energy of the IGM is dominated by large-scale structure shocks (rather
than virialized objects). These shocks can have a variety of effects, including
stripping ~10% of the gas from dark matter minihalos, accelerating cosmic rays,
and creating a diffuse radiation background from inverse Compton and cooling
radiation. This radiation background develops before the first stars form and
could have measurable effects on molecular hydrogen formation and the spin
temperature of the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen. Finally, we show that
shock-heating will also be directly detectable by redshifted 21 cm measurements

powered by field stars or low-mass clusters formed within the last ~100 Myr.

naturally to stellar halos with masses and density profiles much like the

density profile is expected to drop off with radius more quickly than that of
the dark matter because the stellar halo is formed from the most tightly bound
material in infalling systems, while the majority of the accreted dark matter
is stripped and deposited at larger radii. We argue that stars associated with
the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving
satellites and also different from stars in the outer halo or those liberated
in recent disruption events. We discuss how deep halo surveys and chemical
probes may be useful tools for uncovering evidence of accretion. Searches of
this kind offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on

structure along the line of sight. We find this to be complex, with at least
nine components, mostly blue-shifted, spanning a velocity range of nearly
200km/s. The presence of components with a large blue-shift rules out a nearby
location and requires that the binary be located at or beyond the tangent

also has a slightly positive systemic velocity, suggesting that the source, and
this cloud, could be on the far side of the Galaxy, where the radial velocities
due to Galactic rotation become positive again. If this is the case, we require
a distance of ~15kpc. This is less secure than the 6kpc lower limit however. We
discuss the implications of these possible distances for the outburst and
quiescent luminosities, and the nature of the companion star, and argue that a
large distance is consistent with these characteristics. In particular, it
would explain the non-detection of the companion star during the faintest

10microsec, energy resolution of 1-4 keV over the broad band, and duty cycle of
0.2-0.5 for continuous coverage of any source provide an unprecedented phase
space for timing and spectral studies of black holes --from stellar to

spectrum and other statistical properties of the 21 cm brightness temperature

ways that depend on the mechanism through which the first generation of sources
shuts off. If, for example, the transition occurs globally at a fixed redshift,
the first generation imprints a persistent feature on the 21 cm power spectrum.
Finally, we compare our model to one in which voids are ionized first. While
the power spectra of these two models are qualitatively similar, we show that
the underlying distributions of neutral hydrogen differ dramatically and
suggest that other statistical tests can distinguish them. The next generation
of low-frequency radio telescopes will have the sensitivity to distinguish all
of these models and strongly constrain the history and morphology of

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406131v1,Constraining the Topology of Reionization Through Lyman-alpha Absorption,"  The reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is a crucial
landmark in the history of the universe, but the processes through which it
occurs remain mysterious. In particular, recent numerical and analytic work
suggest that reionization by stellar sources is driven by large-scale density
fluctuations and must be inhomogeneous on scales of many comoving Mpc. We
examine the prospects for constraining the topology of neutral and ionized gas
through Lyman-alpha absorption of high-redshift sources. One method is to
search for gaps in the Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs of luminous sources.
These could occur if the line of sight passes sufficiently close to the center
of a large HII region. In contrast to previous work, we find a non-negligible
(though still small) probability of observing such a gap before reionization is
complete. In our model the transmission spike at z=6.08 in the spectrum of SDSS
J1148+5251 does not necessarily require overlap to have been completed at an
earlier epoch. We also examine the IGM damping wing absorption of the
Lyman-alpha emission lines of star-forming galaxies. Because most galaxies sit
inside of large HII regions, we find that the severity of absorption is
significantly smaller than previously thought and decoupled from the properties
of the observed galaxy. While this limits our ability to constrain the mean
neutral fraction of the IGM from observations of individual galaxies, it
presents the exciting possibility of measuring the size distribution and
evolution of the ionized bubbles by examining the distribution of damping wing
optical depths in a large sample of galaxies.

have offered abundant spectral and timing information about the source, and
have thus provided serious challenges to theoretical models. We propose a
coupled accretion-jet model to interpret the observations. We model the
accretion flow as an outer standard thin accretion disk truncated at a
transition radius by an inner hot accretion flow. The accretion flow accounts
for the observed UV and X-ray emission, but it substantially under-predicts the
radio and infrared fluxes, even after we allow for nonthermal electrons in the
hot flow. We attribute the latter components to a jet. We model the jet
emission by means of the internal shock scenario which is widely employed for
gamma-ray bursts. In our accretion-jet model of XTE J1118+480, the jet
dominates the radio and infrared emission, the thin disk dominates the UV
emission, and the hot flow produces most of the X-ray emission. The optical
emission has contributions from all three components: jet, thin disk, and hot
flow. The model qualitatively accounts for timing features, such as the
intriguing positive and negative time lags between the optical and X-ray
emission, and the wavelength-dependent variability amplitude.

present-day galaxies, had a profound impact on their environment. I highlight
the principle of self-regulation, by which supermassive black holes grow until
they release sufficient energy to unbind the gas that feeds them from their
host galaxy. This principle explains several observed facts, including the
correlation between the mass of a central black hole and the depth of the
gravitational potential well of its host galaxy, and the abundance and
clustering properties of bright quasars in the redshift interval of z~2-6. At
lower redshifts, quasars might have limited the maximum mass of galaxies
through the suppression of cooling flows in X-ray clusters. The seeds of
supermassive black holes were likely planted in dwarf galaxies at redshifts
z>10, through the collapse of massive or supermassive stars. The minimum seed
mass can be identified observationally through the detection of gravitational
waves from black hole binaries by Advanced LIGO or LISA. Aside from shaping
their host galaxies, quasar outflows filled the intergalactic medium with
magnetic fields and heavy elements. Beyond the reach of these outflows, the
brightest quasars at z>6 have ionized exceedingly large volumes of gas (tens of
comoving Mpc) prior to global reionization, and must have suppressed the faint
end of the galaxy luminosity function in these volumes before the same occurred
through the rest of the universe.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408455v1,Primordial Bispectrum Information from CMB Polarization,"  After the precise observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropy power spectrum, attention is now being focused on the higher order
statistics of the CMB anisotropies. Since linear evolution preserves the
statistical properties of the initial conditions, observed non-Gaussianity of
the CMB will mirror primordial non-Gaussianity. Single field slow-roll
inflation robustly predicts negligible non-Gaussianity so an indication of
non-Gaussianity will suggest alternative scenarios need to be considered. In
this paper we calculate the information on primordial non-Gaussianity encoded
in the polarization of the CMB. After deriving the optimal weights for a cubic
estimator we evaluate the Signal-to-Noise ratio of the estimator for WMAP,
Planck and an ideal cosmic variance limited experiment. We find that when the
experiment can observe CMB polarization with good sensitivity, the sensitivity
to primordial non-Gaussianity increases by roughly a factor of two. We also
test the weakly non-Gaussian assumption used to derive the optimal weight
factor by calculating the degradation factor produced by the gravitational
lensing induced connected four-point function. The physical scales in the
radiative transfer functions are largely irrelevant for the constraints on the
primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that the total (S/N)^2 is simply
proportional to the number of observed pixels on the sky.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409656v2,Is Double Reionization Physically Plausible?,"  Recent observations of z~6 quasars and the cosmic microwave background imply
a complex history to cosmic reionization. Such a history requires some form of
feedback to extend reionization over a long time interval, but the nature of
the feedback and how rapidly it operates remain highly uncertain. Here we focus
on one aspect of this complexity: which physical processes can cause the global
ionized fraction to evolve non-monotonically with cosmic time? We consider a
range of mechanisms and conclude that double reionization is much less likely
than a long, but still monotonic, ionization history. We first examine how
galactic winds affect the transition from metal-free to normal star formation.
Because the transition is actually spatially inhomogeneous and temporally
extended, this mechanism cannot be responsible for double reionization given
plausible parameters for the winds. We next consider photoheating, which causes
the cosmological Jeans mass to increase in ionized regions and hence suppresses
galaxy formation there. In this case, double reionization requires that small
halos form stars efficiently, that the suppression from photoheating is strong
relative to current expectations, and that ionizing photons are preferentially
produced outside of previously ionized regions. Finally, we consider H_2
photodissociation, in which the buildup of a soft ultraviolet background
suppresses star formation in small halos. This can in principle cause the
ionized fraction to temporarily decrease, but only during the earliest stages
of reionization. Finally, we briefly consider the effects of some of these
feedback mechanisms on the topology of reionization.

the results of a study suggesting that radio bremsstrahlung from the compressed

to 12 kpc. We discuss the implications of this reduced distance estimate. The
apparent motion of small-scale jet components is not superluminal, so if
superluminal motion is required for an object to be termed a microquasar, GRS
1915+105 actually does not qualify. The mass of the black hole in the system is

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411108v2,Modeling feedback from stars and black holes in galaxy mergers,"  We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and
black hole accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At
present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on
galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained
representations of the properties of the interstellar medium and black hole
accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these
effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a
multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation
pressurises highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state. We
show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger
gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by
including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive black holes in
galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric
luminosity of accreting black holes to the surrounding gas, we show how this
feedback regulates the growth of black holes. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies,
we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central AGN activity when
the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an
accreting supermassive black hole has grown to a critical size, feedback
terminates its further growth, and expels gas from the central region in a
powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to
address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation, and black hole
accretion during the formation of galaxies.

line-of-sight. The changing delay in the propagation of photons produces an
apparent deceleration of the planet across the sky throughout the transit. This
persistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the
transit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly
symmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate
than egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such
as Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this
asymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and
planetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the
orbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}. Therefore, this effect constitutes a new
method for a purely dynamical determination of the mass of the star, which is
currently inferred indirectly with theoretical uncertainties based on spectral
modeling. Radial velocity data for the reflex motion of the star can then be
used to determine the planet's mass. Although orbital eccentricity could
introduce a larger asymmetry than the light propagation delay, the eccentricity
is expected to decay by tidal dissipation to negligible values for a close-in
planet with no perturbing third body. Future detection of the eclipse of a
planet's emission by its star could be used to measure the light propagation
delay across the orbital diameter, 46.7(R/7x10^{11}cm) seconds, and also
determine the stellar mass from the orbital period.

haloes of dark matter. This view has recently been challenged by surprisingly
low random stellar velocities in the outskirts of ordinary elliptical galaxies,
which were interpreted as indicating a lack of dark matter (Mendez et al. 2001;

compatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. Using numerical
simulations of disc-galaxy mergers, we find that the stellar orbits in the
outer regions of the resulting ellipticals are very elongated. These stars were
torn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close
passage and put on outgoing trajectories. The elongated orbits, combined with
the steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain the

Projection effects when viewing a triaxial elliptical can lead to even lower
observed velocities along certain lines of sight.

found at the centers of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to
the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass

follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy

merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and
thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas
to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines
the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains
the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity

energy within individual gas particles and dissipates this energy on a
time-scale specified by two free parameters; tau_fb, which sets the dissipative

functions is significantly larger than the S/N of any estimator based on
higher-order correlation functions; justifying our choice to focus on the
three-point correlation function. We then conclude that the estimator based on
the three-point correlation function, which was used by WMAP, is optimal,
meaning it saturates the Cramer-Rao Inequality when the underlying CMB map is
nearly Gaussian. We quantify this restriction by demonstrating that the
suboptimal character of our estimator is proportonal to the square of the
fiducial non-Gaussianity, which is already constrained to be extremely small,
so we can consider the WMAP estimator to be optimal in practice. Our
conclusions do not depend on the form of the primordial bispectrum, only on the
observationally established weak levels of primordial non-Gaussianity.

in cosmological SPH simulations of a Lambda CDM universe. Our models include
radiative cooling and heating by a uniform UV background, star formation,
supernova feedback, and a phenomenological model for galactic winds. Analysing
a series of simulations of varying boxsize and particle number allows us to
isolate the impact of numerical resolution on our results. Specifically, we
determine the luminosity functions in B, V, R, i', and z' filters, and compare
the results with observed galaxy surveys done with the Subaru telescope and the
Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the simulated galaxies have UV colours
consistent with observations and fall in the expected region of the
colour-colour diagrams used by the Subaru group. Assuming a uniform extinction
of E(B-V) = 0.15, we also find reasonable agreement between simulations and
observations in the space density of UV bright galaxies at z = 3 - 6, down to
the magnitude limit of each survey. For the same moderate extinction level of
E(B-V) ~ 0.15, the simulated luminosity functions match observational data, but
have a steep faint-end slope with alpha ~ -2.0. We discuss the implications of
the steep faint-end slope found in the simulations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504112v2,The Small-Scale Power Spectrum of Cold Dark Matter,"  One of the best motivated hypotheses in cosmology states that most of the
matter in the universe is in the form of weakly-interacting massive particles
that decoupled early in the history of the universe and cooled adiabatically to
an extremely low temperature. Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon
scales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their
small scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized
cut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at
the thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing
to the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation
field. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at
thermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of
\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.
The suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic
oscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although
the two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a
particle mass of M~100GeV. The initial conditions for recent numerical
simulations of the earliest and smallest objects to have formed in the
universe, need to be modified accordingly. The smallest dark matter clumps may
be detectable through gamma-ray production from particle annihilation, through
fluctuations in the event rate of direct detection experiments, or through
their tidal gravitational effect on wide orbits of objects near the outer edge
of the solar system.

  Quasar Luminosity Function","  We propose a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity function (LF),
derived from physically motivated models of quasar lifetimes and light curves.
In our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and their lifetime depends on both their
instantaneous and peak luminosities. We study this model using simulations of
galaxy mergers that successfully reproduce a wide range of observed quasar
phenomena. With lifetimes inferred from the simulations, we deconvolve the
observed quasar LF from the distribution of peak luminosities, and show that
they differ qualitatively, unlike for the simple models of quasar lifetimes
used previously. We find that the bright end of the LF traces the intrinsic
peak quasar activity, but that the faint end consists of quasars which are
either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and higher
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the LF corresponds directly to the
maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities, which falls off at
both brighter and fainter luminosities. Our interpretation of the quasar LF
provides a physical basis for the nature and slope of the faint-end
distribution, as well as the location of the break luminosity.

while AM CVn and GP Com show an enhancement of nitrogen. A large fraction of
the accretion luminosity is emitted in the UV. We determine accretion
luminosities of ~1.6x10^{33} ergs/s and 1.7x10^{31} ergs/s for AM CVn and GP
Com respectively. Comparing the implied mass transfer rates with that derived
using model fits to optical and UV spectra, we find evidence that in the case
of AM CVn, we do not detect a significant proportion of the accretion energy.

Type 1 QSO 2MASS 234449+1221 first identified in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey.
The underlying X-ray continuum is found to be typical of a broad-line active
galaxy, with photon index Gamma ~ 1.9. Low energy absorption can be modelled by
a column N_H ~ 10^22 cm^{-2} of moderately ionised gas or a smaller column of
cold gas. Addition of a soft X-ray emission component significantly improves
the fit in both cases. With the assumption that the soft X-ray flux represents
emission from gas photoionised by the incident X-ray continuum, a comparison of
the absorbed and emitted luminosities indicates a covering factor of ~ 8-17%.
The unusual opportunity to simultaneously observe and quantify ionised
absorption and emission in 2MASS 234449+1221 is due to the relatively large
opacity (for a Type 1 AGN) of the absorbing gas, which depresses the normally
strong continuum below ~ 1 keV. A comparison of the soft X-ray emission of

the ability to distinguish forward versus backward recoils, and compare these

extract the black hole mass and spin from spot images and light curves of the

significant departures from the infrared behaviour, but there are still generic

  Galaxies","  The reionization of cosmic hydrogen, left over from the big bang, increased
its temperature to >~ 1.e4 K. This photo-heating resulted in an increase of the
minimum mass of galaxies and hence a suppression of the cosmic star formation
rate. The affected population of dwarf galaxies included the progenitors of
massive galaxies that formed later. We show that a massive galaxy at a redshift
z >~ 6 should show a double-peaked star formation history marked by a clear
break. This break reflects the suppression signature from reionization of the
region in which the galaxy was assembled. Since massive galaxies originate in
overdense regions where cosmic evolution is accelerated, their environment
reionizes earlier than the rest of the universe. For a galaxy of ~ 1.e12
M_solar in stars at a redshift of z ~ 6.5, the star formation rate should
typically be suppressed at a redshift z >~ 10 since the rest of the universe is
known to have reionized by z >~ 6.5. Indeed, this is inferred to be the case
for HUDF-JD2, a massive galaxy which is potentially at z ~ 6.5 but is inferred

galaxies formed through mergers. Using hundreds of simulations to judge the
impact of progenitor galaxy properties on merger remnants, we find that gas
dissipation provides an important contribution to tilt in the Fundamental Plane
relation. Dissipationless mergers of disks produce remnants that occupy the
virial plane. As the gas content of disk galaxies is increased, the tilt of the
Fundamental Plane relation increases and the slope of the Re-M_* relation
steepens. For gas fractions fgas > 30%, the simulated Fundamental Plane
scalings approach those observed in the K-band. In our simulations, feedback
from supermassive black hole growth has only a minor influence on the
stellar-mass scaling relations of spheroidal galaxies, but may play a role in
maintaining the observed Fundamental Plane tilt at optical wavelengths by
suppressing residual star formation in merger remnants.
  We estimate that \approx 40-100% of the Fundamental Plane tilt induced by
structural properties owes to trends in the central total-to-stellar mass ratio
M_total/M_* produced by dissipation. Lower mass systems obtain greater phase-
space densities than higher mass systems, producing a galaxy mass-dependent
central M_total/M_* and a corresponding tilt in the Fundamental Plane.

Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations that are based on the concordance Lambda cold

medium irradiated by the far ultra-violet radiation from local star-forming
regions, and it calculates thermal and ionization equilibrium between cooling
and heating. The model allows us to predict the mass fraction of a cold neutral
medium (CNM) embedded in a warm neutral medium (WNM). Our cosmological SPH
simulations include a treatment of radiative cooling/heating, star formation,
and feedback effects from supernovae and galactic winds. Using our method, we
make predictions for the [CII] luminosity from high-redshift galaxies which can

neutral gas which is highly uncertain. Our calculations suggest that, in a CDM

Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) brighter than R_AB=23.5 mag are expected to have

synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons, respectively. However, if the
SNR is older than several 10^5 yrs, there are few high-energy particles
emitting TeV gamma-rays because of the energy loss effect and/or the wave
damping effect occurring at low-velocity isothermal shocks. For old SNRs or
SNR-GMC interacting systems capable of generating TeV gamma-ray emitting
particles, we calculated the ratio of TeV gamma-ray (1-10 TeV) to X-ray (2-10

from the expectations based on the virial theorem and homology, including the
""tilt"" of the ""fundamental plane"" and the steep decline of density with mass.
We show that such tilts result from dissipative major mergers once the gas
fraction available for dissipation declines with progenitor mass, and derive
the scaling properties of the progenitors. We use hydrodynamical simulations to
quantify the effects of major mergers with different gas fractions on the
structural properties of galaxies. The tilts are driven by the differential
shrinkage of the effective stellar radius as a function of dissipation in the
merger, while the correlated smaller enhancements in internal velocity and
stellar mass keep the slope of the velocity-stellar mass relation near V \pr
M_*^{1/4}. The progenitors match a straightforward model of disc formation in
LCDM haloes. Their total to stellar mass ratio within the effective radius
varies as M/M_* \pr M_*^-0.25, consistent with supernova feedback. They are
nearly homologous in the sense that the dark-matter fractions within the
effective and virial radii scale with mass in a similar way, with only a weak
decline of density with mass. The progenitor radius is roughly R \pr M_*^0.3,
compatible with today's intermediate late-type galaxies. This indicates that
the latest wet mergers involved relatively big discs. The dissipative gas to
stellar mass ratio is predicted to decline \pr M_*^-0.5, similar to the
observed trend in today's blue sequence galaxies. Such a trend should be
observed in relatively massive gaseous galaxies at z~1-4. The corresponding
""baryonic"" relations are consistent with homology and spherical virial
equilibrium, V \pr R \pr M_b^1/3.

The roughly four times higher incidence along GRB sightlines is inconsistent

explain the result: (i) dust within the MgII absorbers obscures faint quasars
giving a lower observed incidence along quasar sightlines; (ii) the gas is
intrinsic to the GRB event; (iii) the GRB are gravitationally lensed by these
absorbers. We present strong arguments against the first two effects and also

gas via a slow stellar wind. We use two independent sets of AGB yields computed
from detailed models to follow the evolution of helium, carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen in the cluster gas using a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a
number of top-heavy IMFs. In no case were we able to fit the observational
constraints, Y > 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant. Depending on the shape
of the IMF and the yields, we either obtained Y approximately greater than 0.30
and large increases in C+N+O or Y < 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant.
These results suggest that either AGB stars alone are not responsible for the
large helium enrichment or that any dredge-up from this generation of stars was
less than predicted by standard models.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606570v1,Is There a Fundamental Line for Disk Galaxies?,"  We show that there are strong local correlations between metallicity, surface
brightness, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio within M33, analogous to the
fundamental line of dwarf galaxies identified by Prada & Burkert (2002). Using
near-infrared imaging from 2MASS, the published rotation curve of M33, and
literature measurements of the metallicities of HII regions and supergiant
stars, we demonstrate that these correlations hold for points at radial
distances between 140 pc and 6.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. At a given
metallicity or surface brightness, M33 has a mass-to-light ratio approximately
four times as large as the Local Group dwarf galaxies; other than this constant
offset, we see broad agreement between the M33 and dwarf galaxy data. We use
analytical arguments to show that at least two of the three fundamental line
correlations are basic properties of disk galaxies that can be derived from
very general assumptions. We investigate the effect of supernova feedback on
the fundamental line with numerical models and conclude that while feedback
clearly controls the scatter in the fundamental line, it is not needed to
create the fundamental line itself, in agreement with our analytical
calculations. We also compare the M33 data with measurements of a simulated
disk galaxy, finding that the simulation reproduces the trends in the data
correctly and matches the fundamental line, although the metallicity of the
simulated galaxy is too high, and the surface brightness is lower than that of
M33.

corona and a highly relativistic, Poynting-dominated funnel jet in the polar
regions. The polar jet is nearly consistent with the stationary paraboloidal
Blandford-Znajek model of an organized field threading the polar regions of a
rotating black hole. How can a disordered accretion disk and corona lead to an
ordered jet? We show that the polar jet is associated with a strikingly simple
angular-integrated toroidal current distribution $dI_\phi/dr \propto r^{-5/4}$,
where $I_\phi(r)$ is the toroidal current enclosed inside radius $r$. We
demonstrate that the poloidal magnetic field in the simulated jet agrees well
with the force-free field solution for a non-rotating thin disk with an
$r^{-5/4}$ toroidal current, suggesting rotation leads to negligible
self-collimation. We find that the polar field is confined/collimated by the
corona. The electromagnetic field in the disk also scales as $r^{-5/4}$, which
is consistent with some Newtonian accretion models that assume rough
equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure. However, the agreement is
accidental since toward the black hole the magnetic pressure increases faster
than the gas pressure. This field dominance near the black hole is associated
with magnetic stresses that imply a large effective viscosity parameter
$\alpha\sim 1$, whereas the typically assumed value of $\alpha\sim 0.1$ holds
far from the black hole.[abridged]

  Electrodynamical Models","  In paper I, we showed that time-dependent general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical models of accretion disks, although being
highly turbulent, have surprisingly simple electromagnetic properties. In
particular, the toroidal current density in the disk takes the form $dI_\phi/dr
\propto r^{-5/4}$. Guided by this simplicity, we use a time-dependent general
relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) code to study an idealized
problem in which the accretion disk is replaced by an infinitely thin rotating
equatorial current sheet. We consider both an $r^{-5/4}$ current profile and an
$r^{-1}$ profile, the latter corresponding to the paraboloidal model of
Blandford & Znajek (1977). The force-free magnetosphere we obtain with the
$r^{-5/4}$ current sheet matches remarkably well to the Poynting-dominated jet
seen in GRMHD numerical models. By comparing to the non-rotating force-free
model studied in paper I, rotation is seen to lead to mild decollimation of the
jet suggesting that hoop-stress forces nearly cancel centrifugal forces. In
order to study the process that generates the corona and disk wind and destroys
the ordered field in the corona in GRMHD numerical models, the force-free field
with the $r^{-5/4}$ current distribution is embedded in an accretion disk and
followed in a GRMHD simulation. Reconnection and magnetic stresses contribute
to a magnetized, thermal wind without the aid of an ordered field threading the

limit to the allowed degree of evolution in the ratio of black hole (BH) mass

the BH/host ratio is excessive at redshift z, then it would imply that the
total mass density in BHs above some M_BH(min) is larger at that redshift than
at z=0, which is impossible. This argument requires no knowledge of host or BH
properties, only a lower limit to the observed luminosity density in the
brightest galaxies at some z. We calculate this upper limit from a variety of
luminosity and mass functions in different bands from redshifts z=0-2. We show
that it is consistent with passive evolution of spheroid populations (with a
fixed M_BH/M_host relation) in all cases, and provides tighter constraints than
have generally been obtained previously, ruling out at >6 sigma observational
and theoretical estimates suggesting that M_BH/M_host was significantly larger
at high redshifts than locally, although relatively weak (factor ~2 by z=2)

using mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope and optical images

stellar bar is bright at optical and 3.6um, while the dust pattern is more
prominent in the 8um band but also shows up in the SDSS u and g-band images,
suggesting a rich interstellar medium environment harboring ongoing star
formation. This angular misalignment is unlikely to have been caused by
spontaneous bar formation. We suggest that the stellar bar and the dust pattern
may have different formation histories, and that the large misalignment was
triggered by a tidal interaction with a small companion. A statistical analysis
of a large sample of nearby galaxies with archival Spitzer data indicates that
bar structure such as that seen in NGC 3488 is quite rare in the local

sufficient to account for all of the hypervelocity B-stars observed in the

Since HVSs are produced by at least two unavoidable processes, the statistics

nearest and brightest such variable star, a detailed study of XZ Ceti may shed
light on the behaviour of anomalous Cepheids whose representatives have been
mostly detected in external galaxies. CCD photometric and radial velocity
observations have been obtained. The actual period and amplitude of pulsation
were determined by Fourier analysis. The long time scale behaviour of the
pulsation period was studied by the method of the O-C diagram using the
archival Harvard photographic plates and published photometric data. XZ Ceti
differs from the ordinary classical Cepheids in several respects. Its most
peculiar feature is cycle-to-cycle variability of the light curve. The radial
velocity phase curve is not stable either. The pulsation period is subjected to
strong changes on various time scales including a very short one. The ratio of
amplitudes determined from the photometric and radial velocity observations
indicates that this Cepheid performs an overtone pulsation, in accord with the
other known anomalous Cepheid in our Galaxy, BL Boo (V19 in the globular
cluster NGC 5466). Continued observations are necessary to study the deviations
from regularity, to determine their time scale, as well as to confirm binarity
of XZ Ceti and to study its role in the observed peculiar behaviour.

we present mock Chandra analyses of cosmological cluster simulations and assess
X-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties using a model and procedure

reconstruction of three-dimensional ICM density and temperature profiles is
excellent for relaxed clusters, but still reasonably accurate for unrelaxed

while the hydrostatic estimate of the gravitationally bound mass is biased low
by about 5%-20% through the virial region, primarily due to additional pressure
support provided by subsonic bulk motions in the ICM, ubiquitous in our
simulations even in relaxed systems. Gas fraction determinations are therefore
biased high; the bias increases toward cluster outskirts and depends
sensitively on its dynamical state, but we do not observe significant trends of
the bias with cluster mass or redshift. We also find that different average ICM
temperatures, such as the X-ray spectroscopic Tspec and gas-mass-weighted Tmg,
are related to each other by a constant factor with a relatively small
object-to-object scatter and no systematic trend with mass, redshift or the
dynamical state of clusters. We briefly discuss direct applications of our
results for different cluster-based cosmological tests.

HII/HeIII regions around the first stars. Cooling (by H2 and HD) and recollapse
of the gas in the relic HII region is also followed in a full cosmological
context, until second-generation stars are formed. A large HII region with a
few kiloparsec diameter is formed, within which a smaller HeIII region is
embedded. Radiative feedback effect quenches further star-formation within the
halo for a hundred million years. Accretion onto remnant blackholes will be
inefficient. Recombination radiation within the HII region is weak, but
persists for 50 million years. We also follow the thermal and chemical
evolution of the photo-ionized gas in the relic HII region. The gas cools by HD
line cooling down to a few tens Kelvin. At high redshifts (z>10), the minimum
gas temperature is limited by T_CMB. Because of its low temperature, the
characteristic mass of a Jeans-unstable gas clump is ~ 40 Msun, and is
significantly smaller than a typical clump mass for early primordial gas
clouds. We find no evidence of fragmentation by this epoch. Together with the
small cloud mass, this result indicates that massive, rather than very massive,
primordial stars may form in the relic HII region. Such stars might be
responsible for early metal-enrichment of the interstellar medium from which
recently discovered hyper metal-poor stars were born.

the very early universe to radiative emission from newly-formed stars. This
gives the intergalactic medium a dual role as a powerful probe both of
fundamental physics and of astrophysics. The heading of fundamental physics
includes conditions in the very early universe and basic cosmological
parameters. The astrophysics refers to chapters of the long cosmic history of
stars and galaxies that are being revealed through the effects of stellar
feedback on the cosmic gas. This review describes the physics of the
intergalactic medium, focusing on recent theoretical and observational
developments in understanding early cosmic history. In particular, radiation
from the earliest generation of stars is thought to have transformed the
universe, turning the surrounding atoms into free electrons and ions. Knowing
exactly when and how the reionization process happened is a primary goal of
cosmologists, because this would tell us when the early stars and black holes
formed and in what kinds of galaxies.
  Cosmic reionization is beginning to be understood with the help of
theoretical models and computer simulations. A wide variety of instruments
currently under design will probe the first sources of light during an epoch in
cosmic history that has been largely unexplored so far. The new observations
and the challenges for theoretical models and numerical simulations will
motivate intense work in this field over the coming decade. (abridged)

the thermal emission from this pulsar is fully consistent with such a model,
enabling constraints on important properties of the underlying neutron star. We
confirm that the observed thermal X-ray pulsations from J0437--4715 are
incompatible with blackbody emission and require the presence of an optically
thick, light element (most likely hydrogen) atmosphere on the neutron star
surface. The morphology of the X-ray pulse profile is consistent with a global
dipole configuration of the pulsar magnetic field but suggests an off-center
magnetic axis, with a displacement of 0.8-3 km from the stellar center. For an
assumed mass of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$, the model restricts the allowed stellar radii
to R=6.8-13.8 km (90% confidence) and R>6.7 km (99.9% confidence), which is
consistent with standard NS equations of state and rules out an ultracompact
star smaller than its photon sphere. Deeper spectroscopic and timing
observations of this and other nearby radio MSPs with current and future X-ray
facilities (Constellation-X and XEUS) can provide further insight into the
fundamental properties of neutron stars.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701042v2,The Line-of-Sight Proximity Effect and the Mass of Quasar Host Halos,"  We show that the Lyman-alpha optical depth statistics in the proximity
regions of quasar spectra depend on the mass of the dark matter halos hosting
the quasars. This is owing to both the overdensity around the quasars and the
associated infall of gas toward them. For a fiducial quasar host halo mass of
(3.0+/-1.6) h^-1 x 10^12 Msun, as inferred by Croom et al. from clustering in
the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, we show that estimates of the ionizing background
(Gamma^bkg) from proximity effect measurements could be biased high by a factor
of ~2.5 at z=3 owing to neglecting these effects alone. The clustering of
galaxies and other active galactic nuclei around the proximity effect quasars
enhances the local background, but is not expected to skew measurements by more
than a few percent. Assuming the measurements of Gamma^bkg based on the mean
flux decrement in the Ly-alpha forest to be free of bias, we demonstrate how
the proximity effect analysis can be inverted to measure the mass of the dark
matter halos hosting quasars. In ideal conditions, such a measurement could be
made with a precision comparable to the best clustering constraints to date
from a modest sample of only about 100 spectra. We discuss observational
difficulties, including continuum flux estimation, quasar systematic redshift
determination, and quasar variability, which make accurate proximity effect
measurements challenging in practice. These are also likely to contribute to
the discrepancies between existing proximity effect and flux decrement
measurements of Gamma^bkg.

its Oort accretional cavity. SNe Ia events may thus be obscured or not obscured

Lyman alpha lines (hereafter Lya) emitted by galaxies in an ionised IGM at z>4.
Our model accounts for gas clumping in the IGM and for the fact that
high-redshift galaxies reside in overdense regions, which causes the velocity
field of the IGM to depart from the Hubble flow. The observed shape of the Lya
line varies widely, with dependence on the intrinsic width and systemic
velocity of the line, a galaxies star formation rate and the local
extra-galactic UV-background. For large star formation rates and levels of the
UV-background, absorption in the IGM does not result in a Lya line that is
asymmetric as is common among known high-redshift Lya emitters. For models in
which the lines do show the observed strong asymmetry, the IGM typically
transmits only 10-30% of the Lya flux. The increase in the ionising background
that accompanied the completion of reionisation barely increased the IGM
transmission, which suggests that LAEs of comparable luminosity should not
appear to be significantly dimmer prior to overlap. In this light, we briefly
discuss the potential of Lya emitters as a probe into the epoch of
reionisation.

compact accretor at rates lower than in wider X-ray binaries. This may be
understood by the smaller accretion disks in UCXBs: a lower X-ray luminosity
suffices to keep a disk completely ionized through irradiation and, thus, keep
the viscosity at a sufficiently high level to allow effective transport of
matter to the compact object. We employ this distinguishing factor on data from
RXTE and BeppoSAX to identify six new candidate UCXBs, thus increasing the
population by one quarter. The candidates are drawn from the population of
persistently accreting and type-I X-ray bursting low-mass X-ray binaries. The
X-ray bursts establish the low-mass X-ray binary nature and provide a handle on
the accretion rate. We find that the low accretion rates are supported by the
long burst recurrence times and the hard X-ray spectra of the persistent
emission as derived from the 2nd INTEGRAL catalog of soft gamma-ray sources. We
discuss the peculiar light curves of some new UCXB candidates.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702128v2,Magnetic Helicity and the Relaxation of Fossil Fields,"  In the absence of an active dynamo, purely poloidal magnetic field
configurations are unstable to large-scale dynamical perturbations, and decay
via reconnection on an Alfvenic timescale. Nevertheless, a number of classes of
dynamo-free stars do exhibit significant, long-lived, surface magnetic fields.
Numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale poloidal field in these
systems is stabilized by a toroidal component of the field in the stellar
interior. Using the principle of conservation of total helicity, we develop a
variational principle for computing the structure of the magnetic field inside
a conducting sphere surrounded by an insulating vacuum. We show that, for a
fixed total helicity, the minimum energy state corresponds to a force-free
configuration. We find a simple class of axisymmetric solutions, parametrized
by angular and radial quantum numbers. However, these solutions have a
discontinuity in the toroidal magnetic field at the stellar surface which will
exert a toroidal stress on the surface of the star. We then describe two other
classes of solutions, the standard spheromak solutions and ones with fixed
surface magnetic fields, the latter being relevant for neutron stars with rigid
crusts. We discuss the implications of our results for the structure of neutron
star magnetic fields, the decay of fields, and the origin of variability and

Such speeds would enable the merger product to escape its host galaxy. Here we
examine the circumstances resulting from a gas-rich galaxy merger under which
the ejected BH would carry an accretion disk with it and be observable. As the
initial BH binary emits gravitational radiation and its orbit tightens, a hole
is opened around it in the disk which delays the consumption of gas prior to
the eventual BH ejection. The punctured disk remains bound to the ejected BH
within the region where the gas orbital velocity is larger than the ejection
speed. For a ~10^7 solar mass BH the ejected disk has a characteristic size of
tens of thousands of Schwarzschild radii and an accretion lifetime of ~10^7

proposed for completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to
entertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation. Nonetheless,
some remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the
definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed. It remains for
future research to tune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings.

for protein folding. The potential is obtained by optimization procedure, which
simultaneously maximizes the energy gap for {\it all} proteins in the database.
To test our method and compare it with other knowledge-based approaches to
derive potentials, we use simple lattice model. In the framework of the lattice
model we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice
chain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures
with some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a
potential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential. This test on
the model system showed that our procedure is able to recover the potential
with correlation $r \approx 91\%$ with the ``true'' one and we were able to
fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical
knowledge-based approaches were tested using lattice models and the results
indicate that they also can recover the ``true'' potential with high degree of
accuracy. When applied to real protein structures with energy function taken in
contact pairwise approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than
existing ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys
is still not strong enough to make the potential useful for {\em ab initio}
folding. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should
be taken into account to achieve better energy gaps. The suggested method is
general to allow to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated
energy function. The internal control of validity of the potential derived by
our method, is converegency to a unique solution upon addition of new proteins

closely related to the quantum mechanics of a charged particle interacting with

that boson world lines in 2+1 dimensions with periodic boundary conditions,
regarded as ring polymers on a torus, have a mean square winding number given

translated into boson language, the mean square winding number around the rod

behavior of DNA's with random sequences to the more experimentally accessible
problem of unzipping a single DNA molecule. As the applied force approaches the
critical value, the double-stranded DNA unravels in a series of discrete,
sequence-dependent steps that allow it to reach successively deeper energy
minima. Plots of extension versus force thus take the striking form of a series
of plateaus separated by sharp jumps. Similar qualitative features should
reappear in micromanipulation experiments on proteins and on folded RNA
molecules. Despite their unusual form, the extension versus force curves for
single molecules still reveal remnants of the disorder-averaged critical
behavior. Above the transition, the dynamics of the unzipping fork is related
to that of a particle diffusing in a random force field; anomalous,
disorder-dominated behavior is expected until the applied force exceeds the

$\QQ_+(t)=\QQ_-(t)$. This equation generalizes the Haldane relation in
reversible enzyme kinetics. In terms of the probabilities for the forward
($p_+$) and backward ($p_-$) cycles, $k_BT\ln(p_+/p_-)$ is shown to be the
chemical driving force of the NESS, $\Delta\mu$. More interestingly, the moment
generating function of the stochastic number of substrate cycle $\nu(t)$,
$<e^{-\lambda\nu(t)}>$ follows the fluctuation theorem in the form of
Kurchan-Lebowitz-Spohn-type symmetry. When $\lambda$ = $\Delta\mu/k_BT$, we
obtain the Jarzynski-Hatano-Sasa-type equality: $<e^{-\nu(t)\Delta\mu/k_BT}>$
$\equiv$ 1 for all $t$, where $\nu\Delta\mu$ is the fluctuating chemical work
done for sustaining the NESS. This theory suggests possible methods to
experimentally determine the nonequilibrium driving force {\it in situ} from
turnover data via single-molecule enzymology.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9910018v1,Decoupling Control from Data for TCP Congestion Control,"  Many applications want to use TCP congestion control to regulate the
transmission rate of a data packet stream. A natural way to achieve this goal
is to transport the data packet stream on a TCP connection. However, because
TCP implements both congestion and error control, transporting a data packet
stream directly using a TCP connection forces the data packet stream to be
subject to TCP's other properties caused by TCP error control, which may be
inappropriate for these applications.
  The TCP decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of
applying TCP congestion control to a data packet stream without actually
transporting the data packet stream on a TCP connection. Instead, a TCP
connection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up
separately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then
associated with that of the TCP packets. Since the transmission rate of these
TCP packets is under TCP congestion control, so is that of the data packet
stream. Furthermore, since the data packet stream is not transported on a TCP
connection, the regulated data packet stream is not subject to TCP error
control.
  Because of this flexibility, the TCP decoupling approach opens up many new
opportunities, solves old problems, and improves the performance of some
existing applications. All of these advantages will be demonstrated in the
thesis.
  This thesis presents the design, implementation, and analysis of the TCP
decoupling approach, and its successful applications in TCP trunking, wireless
communication, and multimedia streaming.

attractive theory of the semantics of natural language questions, commonly
referred to as the partition theory. Two central notions in this theory are
entailment between questions and answerhood. For example, the question ""Who is
going to the party?"" entails the question ""Is John going to the party?"", and
""John is going to the party"" counts as an answer to both. Groenendijk and
Stokhof define these two notions in terms of partitions of a set of possible
worlds.
  We provide a syntactic characterization of entailment between questions and
answerhood . We show that answers are, in some sense, exactly those formulas
that are built up from instances of the question. This result lets us compare
the partition theory with other approaches to interrogation -- both linguistic
analyses, such as Hamblin's and Karttunen's semantics, and computational
systems, such as Prolog. Our comparison separates a notion of answerhood into
three aspects: equivalence (when two questions or answers are interchangeable),
atomic answers (what instances of a question count as answers), and compound
answers (how answers compose).

http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9711048v1,A Topological Formulation of the Standard Model,"  A topological theory for the interactions in Nature is presented. The theory
derives from the cyclic properties of the topological manifold Q=2T^3 + 3S^1 x
S^2 which has 23 intrinsic degrees of freedom, discrete Z_3 and Z_2 x Z_3
internal groups, an SU(5) gauge group, and an anomalous U(1) symmetry. These
properties reproduce the standard model with a stable proton, a natural place
for CP violation and doublet-triplet splitting. The equation of motion for the
unified theory is derived and leads to a Higgs field. The thermodynamic
properties of Q are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic
microwave background fluctuations. The manifold Q possesses internal energy
scales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which
constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the
electron and its neutrino are identified as ground states and their masses are
predicted. The correct masses of quarks and the CKM mixing angles can be
derived as well from these energy scales if one uses the anomalous U(1)
symmetry. Furthermore, it is shown that if the Planck scale topology of the
universe involves loops as fundamental objects, its spatial dimension is equal
to three. The existence of the prime manifold T^3=S^1 x S^1 S^1 is then
required for a dynamical universe, i.e. a universe which supports forces. Some
links with M-theory are pointed out.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9504310v2,"The Chiral Phase Transition in QCD: Critical Phenomena and Long
  Wavelength Pion Oscillations","  In QCD with two massless quarks, the chiral phase transition is plausibly in
the same universality class as the classical O(4) magnet. To test this
hypothesis, critical exponents characterizing the behaviour of universal
quantities near the 2nd order critical point can be calculated and compared to
results from lattice simulations. Present simulations already allow many
qualitative tests; quantitative tests await future simulations with longer
correlation lengths. In a heavy ion collision, a long correlation length would
lead to large fluctuations in the number ratio of neutral to charged pions.
Unfortunately, no equilibrium correlation length gets long enough for this to
occur. Modelling the dynamics of the chiral order parameter in a far from
equilibrium transition by quenching in the linear sigma model suggests that
long wavelength modes of the pion field can be amplified. This could have
dramatic phenomenological consequences. Theoretical advances include attempts
to relax the quench approximation and to include expansion and quantum effects.
Long wavelength pion oscillations arise in a number of theoretical treatments;
however, all involve idealizations and are at best qualitative guides. It is up
to experimentalists to determine whether such phenomena occur; detection in a
heavy ion collision would imply an out of equilibrium chiral transition.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9506331v2,A Lattice Construction of Chiral Gauge Theories,"  We formulate chiral gauge theories non-perturbatively, using two different
cuttoffs for the fermions and gauge bosons. We use a lattice with spacing $b$
to regulate the gauge fields in standard fashion, while computing the chiral
fermion determinant on a finer lattice with spacing $f << b$. This determinant
is computed in the background of $f$-lattice gauge fields, obtained by
gauge-covariantly interpolating $b$-lattice gauge fields. The notorious
doublers that plague lattice theories containing fermions are decoupled by the
addition of a Wilson term. In chiral theories such a term breaks gauge
invariance explicitly. However, the advantage of the two-cutoff regulator is
that gauge invariance can be restored to $O(f^2/b^2)$ by a {\it one-loop}
subtraction of calculable local gauge field counterterms. We show that the only
obstruction to this procedure is the presence of an uncancelled gauge anomaly
among the fermion representations. We conclude that for practical purposes, it
suffices to choose $f/b \sim b/L$, where $L^4$ is the physical volume of the
system. In our construction it is simple to prove the Adler-Bardeen theorem for
anomalies in global currents to all orders. The related subject of fermion
number violation is also studied. Finally, we discuss the prospects for
improving the efficiency of our algorithm.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9612421v2,Large Charmless Yield in B Decays and Inclusive B Decay Puzzles,"  In recent studies of inclusive $B$ decays, it has been suggested that either
$B$ mesons decay much more copiously to final states with no open charm than
currently assumed, or $B(D^0 \to K^-\pi^+)$ has to be reduced significantly.
This note takes the experimental $B(D^0 \to K^-\pi^+)$ at its face value and
estimates $B(b\to$ no open charm) using complementary methods: one accounts for
the $c$ quark in $b\to c$ transitions, the other accounts for the $\bar c$
quark in $b\to c\bar c s$ transitions. Through cancellation of errors, the
average gives our best estimate of $B(b\to$ no open charm), and the difference
measures the consistency. The results of the methods are consistent with each
other, strongly suggesting a much enhanced $B(b\to$ no open charm). This
observation indicates that non-perturbative QCD effects are probably causing a
sizable fraction of the $b\to c\bar cs$ transitions to be seen as charmless
$b\to s$ processes, contrary to smaller traditional expectations. This
mechanism has generally been overlooked and may explain the existing
experimental data within the framework of the standard model. We then briefly
discuss implications on baryon production governed by $b\to c\bar cs$
processes, rare hadronic $B$ decays and CP violation studies.

Higgs field without the usual difficulties that accompany traditional
technicolor or topcolor theories. The focus of this article is to study the
phenomenology of the new physics required by this mechanism. After establishing
a set of criteria for a plausible top quark seesaw theory, we develop two
models, the first of which has a heavy weak singlet fermion with hypercharge
4/3 while the second has, in addition, a heavy weak singlet hypercharge -2/3
fermion. At low energies, these theories contain one or two Higgs doublets
respectively. We then derive the low energy effective Higgs potential in detail
for the two-doublet theory as well as study the likely experimental signatures
for both theories. A strong constraint on the one-doublet model is the measured
value of the rho parameter which permits the new heavy fermion to have a mass
of about 5-7 TeV, when the Higgs has a mass greater than 300 GeV. In the
two-doublet model, mixing of the new heavy Y=-2/3 fermion and the b quark
affects the prediction for R_b. In order to agree with the current limits on
R_b, the mass of this fermion should be at least 12 TeV. The mass of the heavy
Y=4/3 fermion in the two-doublet model is not as sharply constrained by
experiments and can be as light as 2.5 TeV.

sensitive to initial conditions set in the preceding inflationary phase. Recent
work suggests this may protect super-Hubble metric perturbations from resonant
amplification during preheating. We show that this possibility is fragile and
sensitive to the specific form of the interactions between the inflaton and
other fields. The suppression is naturally absent in two classes of preheating
in which either (1) the vacua of the non-inflaton fields during inflation are
deformed away from the origin, or (2) the effective masses of non-inflaton
fields during inflation are small but during preheating are large. Unlike the
simple toy model of a $g^2 \phi^2 \chi^2$ coupling, most realistic particle
physics models contain these other features. Moreover, they generically lead to
both adiabatic and isocurvature modes and non-Gaussian scars on super-Hubble
scales. Large-scale coherent magnetic fields may also appear naturally.

brane models in general in the presence of a radius stabilization mechanism. We
find that the expansion of our universe is generically in agreement with the
expected effective four dimensional description. The constraint (which is
responsible for the appearance of non-conventional cosmologies in these models)
that must be imposed on the matter densities on the two branes in the theory
without a stabilized radius is a consequence of requiring a static solution
even in the absence of stabilization. Such constraints disappear in the
presence of a stablizing potential, and the ordinary FRW
(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) equations are reproduced, with the expansion
driven by the sum of the physical values of the energy densities on the two
branes and in the bulk. For the case of the Randall-Sundrum model we examine
the kinematics of the radion field, and find that corrections to the standard
FRW equations are small for temperatures below the weak scale. We find that the
radion field has renormalizable and unsuppressed couplings to Standard Model
particles after electroweak symmetry breaking. These couplings may have
important implications for collider searches. We comment on the possibility
that matter off the TeV brane could serve as a dark matter candidate.

breaking in which the standard model Higgs particle is realized as a
pseudo-Goldstone boson and thus is generically light. The symmetry breaking
structure of the Little Higgs models predicts a large multiplet of
(pseudo-)Goldstone bosons and their low energy interactions below the
ultraviolet (UV) completion scale $\Lambda \sim 4\pi f \sim O(10)$ TeV, where
$f$ is the Goldstone decay constant. We study unitarity of the Little Higgs
models by systematically analyzing the high energy scatterings of these
(pseudo-)Goldstone bosons. We reveal that the collective effect of the
Goldstone scatterings via coupled channel analysis tends to push the unitarity
violation scale $\Lambda_U$ significantly below the conventional UV scale
$\Lambda \sim 4\pi f$ as estimated by naive dimensional analysis (NDA).
Specifically, $\Lambda_U \sim (3-4)f$, lying in the multi-TeV range for $f\sim
1$ TeV. We interpret this as an encouraging sign that the upcoming LHC may
explore aspects of Little Higgs UV completions, and we discuss some potential
signatures. The meanings of the two estimated UV scales $\Lambda_U$ (from
unitarity violation) and $\Lambda$ (from NDA) together with their implications
for an effective field theory analysis of the Little Higgs models are also

constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the

observations. A heuristic argument for the occurrence and magnitude of CP

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0204047v3,Black Holes on Cylinders,"  We take steps toward constructing explicit solutions that describe
non-extremal charged dilatonic branes of string/M-theory with a transverse
circle. Using a new coordinate system we find an ansatz for the solutions with
only one unknown function. We show that this function is independent of the
charge and our ansatz can therefore also be used to construct neutral black
holes on cylinders and near-extremal charged dilatonic branes with a transverse
circle. For sufficiently large mass $M > M_c$ these solutions have a horizon
that connects across the cylinder but they are not translationally invariant
along the circle direction. We argue that the neutral solution has larger
entropy than the neutral black string for any given mass. This means that for
$M > M_c$ the neutral black string can gain entropy by redistributing its mass
to a solution that breaks translational invariance along the circle, despite
the fact that it is classically stable. We furthermore explain how our
construction can be used to study the thermodynamics of Little String Theory.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0301038v2,Timelike Boundary Liouville Theory,"  The timelike boundary Liouville (TBL) conformal field theory consisting of a
negative norm boson with an exponential boundary interaction is considered. TBL
and its close cousin, a positive norm boson with a non-hermitian boundary
interaction, arise in the description of the $c=1$ accumulation point of $c<1$
minimal models, as the worldsheet description of open string tachyon
condensation in string theory and in scaling limits of superconductors with
line defects. Bulk correlators are shown to be exactly soluble. In contrast,
due to OPE singularities near the boundary interaction, the computation of
boundary correlators is a challenging problem which we address but do not fully
solve. Analytic continuation from the known correlators of spatial boundary
Liouville to TBL encounters an infinite accumulation of poles and zeros. A
particular contour prescription is proposed which cancels the poles against the
zeros in the boundary correlator $d(\o) $ of two operators of weight $\o^2$ and
yields a finite result. A general relation is proposed between two-point CFT
correlators and stringy Bogolubov coefficients, according to which the
magnitude of $d(\o)$ determines the rate of open string pair creation during
tachyon condensation. The rate so obtained agrees at large $\o$ with a
minisuperspace analysis of previous work. It is suggested that the mathematical
ambiguity arising in the prescription for analytic continuation of the
correlators corresponds to the physical ambiguity in the choice of open string
modes and vacua in a time dependent background.

non-standard cosmological histories. To illustrate this, we construct an
explicit model in which the expansion of our universe originates from an
asymptotically flat state in the past, smoothing out the big-bang singularity
within control of a low-energy effective theory. This gives an interesting
alternative to standard inflation for solving the horizon problem. We also
construct models in which the present acceleration has w < -1; a periodic

realized as the incompressible (or infinite speed of sound) limit of a scalar
field theory with a non-canonical kinetic term (or k-essence). Even though
perturbations of Cuscuton propagate superluminally, we show that they have a
locally degenerate phase space volume (or zero entropy), implying that they
cannot carry any microscopic information, and thus the theory is causal. Even
coupling to ordinary scalar fields cannot lead to superluminal signal
propagation. Furthermore, we show that the family of constant field
hypersurfaces are the family of Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces,
which are the analogs of soap films (or soap bubbles) in a Euclidian space.
This enables us to find the most general solution in 1+1 dimensions, whose
properties motivate conjectures for global degeneracy of the phase space in
higher dimensions. Finally, we show that the Cuscuton action can model the
continuum limit of the evolution of a field with discrete degrees of freedom
and argue why it is protected against quantum corrections at low energies.
While this paper mainly focuses on interesting features of Cuscuton in a
Minkowski spacetime, a companion paper (astro-ph/0702002) examines cosmology

Tonghai Yang. First, we construct an modular form \phi(\tau) of weight 3/2
valued in the arithmetic Chow group of the arithmetic surface M attached toa
Shimura curve over Q. The q-expansion of this function is an analogue of the
Hirzebruch-Zagier generating function for the cohomology classes of curves on a
Hilbert modular surface. This`arithmetic theta function' is used to define an
`arithmetic theta lift' from modular forms of weight 3/2 to the arithmetic Chow
group of M. For integers t_1 and t_2 with t_1t_2 not a square, the

beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force and the
creation of matter during the Big Bang. Previous measurements of the neutron
lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors; however, these
could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in
a magnetic trap. Neutral and charged particle traps are widely used tool for
studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long
interaction times and isolation from perturbing environments. Here we report
the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with
superfluid 4-He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a
scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons have a lifetime in the trap of 750
+330/-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap losses.
Our experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding the loading process

nonstationary sequences formed in three ways: (i) stitching together segments
of data obtained from discontinuous experimental recordings, or removing some
noisy and unreliable parts from continuous recordings and stitching together
the remaining parts -- a ``cutting'' procedure commonly used in preparing data
prior to signal analysis; (ii) adding to a signal with known correlations a
tunable concentration of random outliers or spikes with different amplitude,
and (iii) generating a signal comprised of segments with different properties
-- e.g. different standard deviations or different correlation exponents. We
compare the difference between the scaling results obtained for stationary
correlated signals and correlated signals with these three types of
nonstationarities.

energies given by the Gutenberg-Richter law. Based on the two first statistical
log-moments, it evaluates quantitatively the deviations of the distribution of
scalar seismic moments from a power-like (Pareto) law. This statistic is close
to zero for the Pareto law with arbitrary power index, and deviates from zero
for any non-Pareto distribution. A version of this statistic for discrete
distribution of quantified magnitudes is also given. A methodology based on
this statistics consisting in scanning the lower threshold for earthquake
energies provides an explicit visualization of deviations from the Pareto law,
surpassing in sensitivity the standard Hill estimator or other known

earthquakes (h < 70 km) both in subduction zones and in mid-ocean ridge zones
(using the Harvard catalog of seismic moments, 1977-2000), and to several
regional catalogs of magnitudes (California, Japan, Italy, Greece). We discover
evidence for log-periodicity and thus for a discrete hierarchy of scales for
low-angle dipping, low-strain subduction zones with a preferred scaling ratio
g=7+-1 for seismic moments, compatible with a preferred scaling ratio of 2 for
linear rupture sizes, and consistent with previous reports. We propose a

a silicon-polymer integrated waveguide device, based on the all-optical Kerr
effect - the same ultrafast effect used in four-wave mixing. Direct
measurements of time-domain intensity modulation are made at speeds of 10 GHz.
We showed experimentally that the ultrafast mechanism of this modulation
functions at the optical frequency through spectral measurements, and that
intensity modulation at frequencies in excess of 1 THz can be obtained in this
device. By integrating optical polymers through evanescent coupling to
high-mode-confinement silicon waveguides, we greatly increase the effective
nonlinearity of the waveguide for cross-phase modulation. The combination of
high mode confinement, multiple integrated optical components, and high
nonlinearities produces all-optical ultrafast devices operating at
continuous-wave power levels compatible with telecommunication systems.
Although far from commercial radio frequency optical modulator standards in
terms of extinction, these devices are a first step in development of
large-scale integrated ultrafast optical logic in silicon, and are two orders

particularly efficient to reveal the coexistence of several types of relaxation
laws (typical Omori sequences and short-lived swarms sequences) which can be

GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the

of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be
relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a

compare integrated emission line spectra from our models and quantify any

location for all ionising sources. We find that the dependence of the
metallicity indicators on the ionisation parameter causes a clear bias, due to
the fact that models with a fully distributed configuration of stars always
display lower ionisation parameters than their fully concentrated counterparts.

The average radio-OIR spectrum for NSXBs is alpha ~ +0.2 (where L_nu propto
nu^alpha) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected. This is
comparable to, but slightly more inverted than the alpha ~ 0.0 found for black

are compared to those expected if the OIR emission is dominated by thermal
emission from an X-ray or viscously heated disc, or synchrotron emission from

http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4036v2,"Disrupting Terrorist Networks, a dynamic fitness landscape approach","  Over a period of approximately five years, Pankaj Ghemawat of Harvard
Business School and Daniel Levinthal of the Wharton School have been working on
a detailed simulation (producing approximately a million fitness landscape
graphs) in order to determine optimal patterns of decision-making for
corporations. In 2006, we adapted this study, combining it with our own work on
terrorism to examine what would happen if we inverted Ghemawat and Levinthal's
findings and sought to provide disinformation or otherwise interfere with the
communications and decision processes of terrorist organizations in order to
optimize poor decision making and inefficiencies in organizational
coordination, command and control.
  The bulk of this study was then presented at the 2006 annual meeting of the
North American Association for Computation in the Social and Organizational
Sciences. We present here an updated version of that study, emphasizing the
rather counter-intuitive finding that ""soft"" targets have almost no value and
that unless one can influence key factors, an effort directed at the easy to
reach elements of terrorist organizations may actually be worse than mounting
no effort at all. We conclude with the recommendation that some fundamental
rethinking may be required if the United States is to effectively defend itself
from future terrorist attacks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3511v1,The effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger--driven starbursts,"  We employ numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to explore the effect of
galaxy mass ratio on merger--driven starbursts. Our numerical simulations
include radiative cooling of gas, star formation, and stellar feedback to
follow the interaction and merger of four disk galaxies. The galaxy models span
a factor of 23 in total mass and are designed to be representative of typical
galaxies in the local Universe. We find that the merger--driven star formation
is a strong function of merger mass ratio, with very little, if any, induced
star formation for large mass ratio mergers. We define a burst efficiency that
is useful to characterize the merger--driven star formation and test that it is
insensitive to uncertainties in the feedback parameterization. In accord with
previous work we find that the burst efficiency depends on the structure of the
primary galaxy. In particular, the presence of a massive stellar bulge
stabilizes the disk and suppresses merger--driven star formation for large mass
ratio mergers. Direct, co--planar merging orbits produce the largest tidal
disturbance and yield that most intense burst of star formation. Contrary to
naive expectations, a more compact distribution of gas or an increased gas
fraction both decrease the burst efficiency. Owing to the efficient feedback
model and the newer version of SPH employed here, the burst efficiencies of the
mergers presented here are smaller than in previous studies.

A0620-00 with the the 6.5-m Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas
Observatory. We measure absorption-line radial velocities of the secondary and
make the most precise determination to date (K2 = 435.4 +/- 0.5 km/s). By
fitting the rotational broadening of the secondary, we refine the mass ratio to
q = 0.060 +/- 0.004; these results, combined with the orbital period, imply a
minimum mass for the compact object of 3.10 +/- 0.04 Msun. Although quiescence
implies little accretion activity, we find that the disc contributes 56 +/- 7
per cent of the light in B and V, and is subject to significant flickering.
Doppler maps of the Balmer lines reveal bright emission from the gas
stream-disc impact point and unusual crescent-shaped features. We also find
that the disc centre of symmetry does not coincide with the predicted black
hole velocity. By comparison with SPH simulations, we identify this source with
an eccentric disc. With high S/N, we pursue modulation tomography of H-alpha
and find that the aforementioned bright regions are strongly modulated at the
orbital period. We interpret this modulation in the context of disc precession,
and discuss cases for the accretion disc evolution.

population synthesis method, modeling the birth properties of the pulsars,
their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and Swinburne Multibeam
(MB) surveys. Together, the Parkes and Swinburne MB surveys have detected
nearly 2/3 of the known pulsars and provide a remarkably homogeneous sample to
compare with simulations. New proper motion measurements and an improved model
of the distribution of free electrons in the interstellar medium, NE2001, also
make revisiting these issues particularly worthwhile. We present a simple
population model that reproduces the actual observations well, and consider
others that fail. We conclude that: pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with
the birthrate of 2.8+/-0.5 pulsars/century peaking at a distance ~3 kpc from
the Galactic centre, and with mean initial speed of 380^{+40}_{-60} km/s; the
birth spin period distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no
evidence of multimodality, implying that characteristic ages overestimate the
true ages of the pulsars by a median factor >2 for true ages <30,000 yr; models
in which the radio luminosities of the pulsars are random generically fail to
reproduce the observed P-Pdot diagram, suggesting a relation between intrinsic
radio luminosity and (P, Pdot); radio luminosities L Edot^0.5 provide a good
match to the observed P-Pdot diagram; for this favored radio luminosity model,
we find no evidence for significant magnetic field decay over the lifetime of
the pulsars as radio sources ~100 Myr.

the SQ galaxies gently separate and remain precisely along a line of sight

previous observations of a bump in the dust-correlated spectrum, consistent
with the Draine & Lazarian spinning dust model. 2. We also confirm the ""haze""
signal in the inner Galaxy, and argue that it does not follow a free-free
spectrum as first thought, but instead is synchrotron emission from a hard
electron cosmic-ray population. 3. In a departure from previous work, we allow
the spectrum of Halpha-correlated emission (which is used to trace the
free-free component) to float in the fit, and find that it does not follow the
expected free-free spectrum. Instead there is a bump near 50 GHz, modifying the
spectrum at the 20% level, which we speculate is caused by spinning dust in the
warm ionized medium. 4. The derived cross-correlation spectra are not sensitive
to the map zero points, but are sensitive to the choice of CMB estimator. In
cases where the CMB estimator is derived by minimizing variance of a linear
combination of the WMAP bands, we show that a bias proportional to the
cross-correlation of each template and the true CMB is always present. This
bias can be larger than any of the foreground signals in some bands. 5. Lastly,
we consider the frequency coverage and sensitivity of the Planck mission, and
suggest linear combination coefficients for the CMB template that will reduce
both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the synchrotron and haze

observed by LISA can be localized to within the field of view of astronomical
instruments ~10 deg^2 hours to weeks prior to coalescence. The temporal
coincidence of any prompt EM counterpart with a gravitationally-timed merger
may offer the best chance of identifying a unique host galaxy. We discuss the
challenges posed by searches for prompt EM counterparts and propose novel
observational strategies to address them. In particular, we discuss the size

quantify the requirements for dedicated EM surveys of the area prior to
coalescence. A triggered EM counterpart search campaign will require monitoring
a several-square degree area. It could aim for variability at the 24-27 mag

detection. Alternatively, EM searches can detect a transient signal

the occupation number of the photons in phase space is much larger than unity
and they collectively behave as a classical electromagnetic field. At redshifts
z<20, the spin temperature of the intergalactic gas is dictated by the

occupation number of the signal photons is smaller than unity. Neverethless,
the radiometer equation can still be used in this regime because the weak
signal is accompanied by a flood of foreground photons with a high occupation

change of the orbital period of the binary A0620-00 and use it to constrain the
asymptotic curvature radius of the extra dimension to a value comparable to the

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies via three different fueling
mechanisms: major mergers, minor mergers, and disk instabilities. The SMBHs in
all three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental plane (BHFP) and
correlation with bulge binding energy seen in simulations of major mergers, and
observed locally. Furthermore, provided that the total gas supply is
significantly larger than the mass of the SMBH, its limiting mass is not
influenced by the amount of gas available or the efficiency of black hole
growth. This supports the assertion that SMBHs accrete until they reach a
critical mass at which feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally,
terminating the inflow and stalling further growth. At the same time, while
minor and major mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the
$M_{BH}-\sigma$ and Magorrian relations), SMBHs grown via disk instabilities do
not, owing to structural differences between the host bulges. This finding is
supported by recent observations of SMBHs in pseudobulges and bulges in barred
systems, as compared to those hosted by classical bulges. Taken together, this
provides support for the BHFP and binding energy correlations as being more
""fundamental"" than other proposed correlations in that they reflect the

estimators for CMB lensing are unbiased and achieve the optimal condition only

when the lensing effect is large, especially for clusters that can be found by
ongoing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys. Adopting an alternative approach to the CMB

delensed CMB temperature fields based on an assumed model. We analytically show
that this estimator asymptotically approaches the optimal condition as our
assumed model is refined, and we numerically show that our estimator quickly
converges to the true model as we iteratively apply it to CMB maps. For
realistic CMB experiments, we demonstrate the applicability of the maximum

galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRB-host-DLAs) as functions of neutral hydrogen
column density (N_HI) and projected star formation rate (SFR) using
cosmological SPH simulations. Assuming that the occurrence of GRBs is
correlated with the local SFR, we find that the median N_HI of GRB-host-DLAs
progressively shifts to lower N_HI values with increasing redshift, and the
incidence rate of GRB-host-DLAs with log N_HI > 21.0 decreases rapidly at z>=6.
Our results suggest that the likelihood of observing the signature of IGM
attenuation in GRB afterglows increases towards higher redshift, because it
will not be blocked by the red damping wing of DLAs in the GRB host galaxies.
This enhances the prospects of using high-redshift GRBs to probe the
reionization history of the Universe. The overall incidence rate of
GRB-host-DLAs decreases monotonically with increasing redshift, whereas that of
QSO-DLAs increases up to z=6. A measurement of the difference between the two
incidence rates would enable an estimation of the value of \eta_grb, which is

mergers produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed by
ellipticals. The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratio
of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue
that mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger
mass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and
higher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic
imprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer
profile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In
previous work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed
profiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the
original spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of
observed ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its
tilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more
dissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed
degree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical
mass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed
FP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the
effects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as
disks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.
Dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt.

  Effects and Redshift-Space Distortions","  We present a coherent theoretical framework for computing gravitational
lensing effects and redshift-space distortions in an inhomogeneous universe and
investigate their impacts on galaxy two-point statistics. Adopting the
linearized FRW metric, we derive the gravitational lensing and the generalized
Sachs-Wolfe effects that include the weak lensing distortion, magnification,

integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, respectively. Based on this framework, we first
compute their effects on observed source fluctuations, separating them as two
physically distinct origins: the volume effect that involves the change of
volume and is always present in galaxy two-point statistics, and the source
effect that depends on the intrinsic properties of source populations. Then we
identify several terms that are ignored in the standard method, and we compute
the observed galaxy two-point statistics, an ensemble average of all the
combinations of the intrinsic source fluctuations and the additional
contributions from the gravitational lensing and the generalized Sachs-Wolfe
effects. This unified treatment of galaxy two-point statistics clarifies the
relation of the gravitational lensing and the generalized Sachs-Wolfe effects
to the metric perturbations and the underlying matter fluctuations. For near
future dark energy surveys, we compute additional contributions to the observed

be not only necessary to analyze precision measurements from upcoming dark

determination of their masses, radii, and temperatures have been very sparse.
Thus, theoretical predictions of low-mass evolution and ultracool atmospheres
remain to be rigorously tested. The situation is alarming given that such

initial mass function to the characterization of exoplanets. An increasing
number of mass, radius, and age determinations are placing critical constraints
on the physics of low-mass objects. A wide variety of approaches are being
pursued, including eclipsing binary studies, astrometric-spectroscopic orbital
solutions, interferometry, and characterization of benchmark systems. In
parallel, many more systems suitable for concerted study are now being found,
thanks to new capabilities spanning both the very widest (all-sky surveys) and
very narrowest (diffraction-limited adaptive optics) areas of the sky. This

multi-epoch photometric datasets we were able to study eclipsing binary stars
en masse. In this thesis, we analyzed 185,445 light curves from ten TrES

manage such large quantities of data, we developed a pipeline with which we
systematically identified eclipsing binaries, solved for their geometric

this analysis we assembled catalogs of eclipsing binaries with their models,
computed statistical distributions of their properties, and located rare cases
for further follow-up, including T-Cyg1-03378, which has unusual eclipse timing
variations. Of particular importance are low-mass eclipsing binaries, which are
rare yet critical for resolving the ongoing mass-radius discrepancy between
theoretical models and observations. To this end, we have discovered over a
dozen new low-mass eclipsing binary candidates and spectroscopically confirmed
the masses of five of them. One of these confirmed candidates, T-Lyr1-17236, is

specific parameters of the particle model, with the kinetic decoupling
temperature having the most effect. We find that the cross section can be
reduced by as much as an order of magnitude for extreme cases. We also compute
the mu-type distortion of the CMB energy spectrum caused by energy injection
from such Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation. Our results indicate that in the
vicinity of resonances, associated with bound states, distortions can be large

  collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider","  In high energy heavy ion collisions a hot and dense medium is formed, where
the U_A(1) or chiral symmetry may temporarily be restored. As a consequence,
the mass of the eta'(958) mesons may be reduced to its quark model value, and
the abundance of eta' mesons at low p_T may be enhanced by more than a factor
of 10. The intercept parameter lambda_* of the charged pion Bose--Einstein
correlations provides a sensitive observable of the possibly enhanced eta'
abundance. We have analyzed lambda_*(m_T) data from sqrt(s(NN))=200 GeV central
Au+Au reactions measured at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC),
using extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on six popular models for
hadronic multiplicities. Based on the combined STAR and PHENIX data set, and on
various systematic investigations of resonance multiplicities and model
parameters, we conclude that in sqrt(s(NN))=200 GeV central Au+Au reactions the
mass of the eta' meson is reduced by Delta m > 200 MeV, at the 99.9% confidence
level in the considered model class. Such a significant eta' mass modification
may indicate the restoration of the U_A(1) symmetry in a hot and dense hadronic
matter and the return of the ninth ""prodigal"" Goldstone boson. A similar
analysis of NA44 S+Pb data at top CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies
showed no significant in-medium eta' mass modification.

supergiants and are the most common subclass of core-collapse supernovae. Past
observations have shown that the outer layers of the ejecta of SNe IIP are
largely spherical, but the degree of asphericity increases toward the core. We
present evidence for high degrees of asphericity in the inner cores of three
recent SNe IIP (SNe 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa), as revealed by late-time
optical spectropolarimetry. The three objects were all selected to have very
low interstellar polarization (ISP), which minimizes the uncertainties in ISP
removal and allows us to use the continuum polarization as a tracer of
asphericity. The three objects have intrinsic continuum polarizations in the
range of 0.83-1.56% in observations taken after the end of the photometric
plateau, with the polarization dropping to almost zero at the wavelengths of
strong emission lines. Our observations of SN 2007aa at earlier times, taken on
the photometric plateau, show contrastingly smaller continuum polarizations
(~0.1%). The late-time H-alpha and [O I] line profiles of SN 2006ov provide
further evidence for asphericities in the inner ejecta. Such high core
polarizations in very ordinary core-collapse supernovae provide further
evidence that essentially all core-collapse supernova explosions are highly
aspherical, even if the outer parts of the ejecta show only small deviations
from spherical symmetry.

revolution in recent years thanks to the discovery of the first afterglows and
host galaxies in May 2005. In this review we summarize our current knowledge of
the galactic and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and the implications
for the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i) some short
GRBs occur in elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short GRBs occur in
star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs are distinct
from the host galaxies of long GRBs in terms of star formation rates,
luminosities, and metallicities, and instead appear to be drawn from the
general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs
relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long
GRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution agrees well with predictions for the
locations of NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) unlike long GRBs, which tend to
occur in the brightest regions of their hosts, the environments of short GRBs
generally under-represent the light distribution of their host galaxies. Taken
together, these observations suggest that short GRB progenitors have a wide age
distribution and generally track stellar mass rather than star formation
activity. These results are fully consistent with NS-NS binary mergers, but
partial contribution from prompt or delayed magnetar formation is also
consistent with the data.

outbursts caused by accretion flares.Our result excludes the possibility of GM
Cep being a FUor, EXor, or McNeil's Nebula type star. Several special cases of

Cambridge in autumn 1998. They contain an exposition of the representation
theory of the Lie algebras of compact matrix groups, affine Kac-Moody algebras
and the Virasoro algebra from a unitary point of view. The treatment uses many
of the methods of conformal field theory, in particular the Goddard-Kent-Olive
construction and the Kazami-Suzuki supercharge operator, a generalisation of
the Dirac operator. The proof of the Weyl character formula is taken from
unpublished notes of Peter Goddard. The supersymmetric proof of the Kac
character formula for affine Kac-Moody algebras was also found independently at
roughly the same time by Greg Landweber in his Harvard Ph.D. dissertation. One
of the main novelties of this approach is a very rapid proof of the
Feigin-Fuchs character formula for the discrete series representations of the
Virasoro algebra. It relies only on the first part of the Friedan-Qiu-Shenker
unitarity theorem placing restrictions on the parameter h. Their result, which
only uses elementary properties of plane curves, is presented in detail in
these notes along with the somewhat harder result for c. A substantially
shorter treatment is possible if the final goal is just the Feigin-Fuchs
formula, since in that case only the representation theory of affine sl(2) is
needed (cf the MSRI summer course given in 2000,

contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best.
Individuals at the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner,
on average, than those at the periphery. However, mapping a whole network to
identify central individuals whom to monitor is typically very difficult. We
propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global
network structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected
individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether
such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu
outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided
between a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the
progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.
11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a
whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16
of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the
population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional
time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.
Moreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,
psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

haloes which grow from such initial conditions are triaxial with major-to-minor
axis ratios of order 3:1. They nevertheless grow approximately self-similarly
in time. In all cases they have power-law density profiles and near-constant
velocity anisotropy in their inner regions. Both the power-law index and the
value of the velocity anisotropy depend on the similarity index of the initial
conditions, the former as expected from simple scaling arguments. Halo
structure is thus not ""universal"" but remembers the initial conditions. On
larger scales the density and anisotropy profiles show two characteristic
scales, corresponding to particles at first pericentre and at first apocentre
after infall. They are well approximated by the NFW model only for one value of
the similarity index. In contrast, at all radii within the outer caustic the
pseudo phase-space density can be fit by a single power law with an index which
depends only very weakly on the similarity index of the initial conditions.
This behaviour is very similar to that found for haloes formed from LCDM
initial conditions and so can be considered approximately universal.

of the X-ray flares adopting the same physical model recently used to interpret
the GRB prompt emission: the log-parabolic function. In particular, we show
that their spectral energy distribution (SED) is remarkably curved, while no
significant curvature appears in the underlying X-ray afterglow emission. In
addition, the log-parabolic function is statistically favored with respect to
other proposed spectral models. By using a time resolved spectral analysis, we
show the evolution of the peak energy and the curvature parameters of the SED
during the X-ray flares in two of the brightest GRBs afterglows observed by
SWIFT. We found that in the X-ray flares there is an anti-correlation between
the peak energy and the curvature, as expected in a stochastic acceleration
scenario.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4432v4,Lack of confidence in ABC model choice,"  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become a essential tool for the
analysis of complex stochastic models. Earlier, Grelaud et al. (2009) advocated
the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random
fields, relying on a inter-model sufficiency property to show that the
approximation was legitimate. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a
wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al.,
2008), we now present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for
model choice is ungrounded, since it depends on an unknown amount of
information loss induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The
approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under
comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running
an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of
the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC are
necessary to conduct model choice.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4620v1,"On the Formation of Planetesimals via Secular Gravitational
  Instabilities with Turbulent Stirring","  We study the gravitational instability (GI) of small solids in a gas disk as
a mechanism to form planetesimals. Dissipation from gas drag introduces secular
GI, which proceeds even when standard GI criteria for a critical density or
Toomre's $Q$ predict stability. We include the stabilizing effects of turbulent
diffusion, which suppresses small scale GI. The radially wide rings that do
collapse contain up to $\sim 0.1$ Earth masses of solids. Subsequent
fragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically
homogenous planetesimals. Particle radial drift time scales (and, to a lesser
extent, disk lifetimes and sizes) restrict the viability of secular GI to disks
with weak turbulent diffusion, characterized by $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$. Thus
midplane dead zones are a preferred environment. Large solids with radii
$\gtrsim 10$ cm collapse most rapidly because they partially decouple from the
gas disk. Smaller solids, even below $\sim$ mm-sizes could collapse if
particle-driven turbulence is weakened by either localized pressure maxima or
super-Solar metallicity. Comparison with simulations that include particle
clumping by the streaming instability shows that our linear model underpredicts
rapid, small scale gravitational collapse. Thus the inclusion of more detailed
gas dynamics promotes the formation of planetesimals. We discuss relevant
constraints from Solar System and accretion disk observations.

language emotionalities influence differences among cultures no less than
conceptual differences. Conceptual contents of languages and cultures to
significant extent are determined by words and their semantic differences;
these could be borrowed among languages and exchanged among cultures. Emotional
differences, as suggested in the paper, are related to grammar and mostly
cannot be borrowed. Conceptual and emotional mechanisms of languages are
considered here along with their functions in the mind and cultural evolution.
A fundamental contradiction in human mind is considered: language evolution
requires reduced emotionality, but ""too low"" emotionality makes language
""irrelevant to life,"" disconnected from sensory-motor experience. Neural
mechanisms of these processes are suggested as well as their mathematical
models: the knowledge instinct, the language instinct, the dual model
connecting language and cognition, dynamic logic, neural modeling fields.
Mathematical results are related to cognitive science, linguistics, and
psychology. Experimental evidence and theoretical arguments are discussed.
Approximate equations for evolution of human minds and cultures are obtained.
Their solutions identify three types of cultures: ""conceptual""-pragmatic
cultures, in which emotionality of language is reduced and differentiation
overtakes synthesis resulting in fast evolution at the price of uncertainty of
values, self doubts, and internal crises; ""traditional-emotional"" cultures
where differentiation lags behind synthesis, resulting in cultural stability at
the price of stagnation; and ""multi-cultural"" societies combining fast cultural

http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4118v3,The CO-H2 Conversion Factor in Disc Galaxies and Mergers,"  Relating the observed CO emission from giant molecular clouds (GMCs) to the
underlying H2 column density is a long-standing problem in astrophysics. While
the Galactic CO-H2 conversion factor (Xco) appears to be reasonably constant,
observations indicate that Xco may be depressed in high-surface density
starburst environments. Using a multi-scale approach, we investigate the
dependence of Xco on the galactic environment in numerical simulations of disc
galaxies and galaxy mergers. Xco is proportional to the GMC surface density
divided by the integrated CO intensity, Wco, and Wco is related to the kinetic
temperature and velocity dispersion in the cloud. In disc galaxies (except
within the central ~ kpc), the galactic environment is largely unimportant in
setting the physical properties of GMCs provided they are gravitationally
bound. The temperatures are roughly constant at ~10 K due to the balance of CO
cooling and cosmic ray heating, giving a nearly constant CO-H2 conversion
factor in discs. In mergers, the velocity dispersion of the gas rises
dramatically during coalescence. The gas temperature also rises as it couples
well to the warm (~50 K) dust at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^-3). The rise in
velocity dispersion and temperature combine to offset the rise in surface
density in mergers, causing Xco to drop by a factor of ~2-10 compared to the
disc simulation. This model predicts that high-resolution ALMA observations of
nearby ULIRGs should show velocity dispersions of ~10-100 km/s, and brightness
temperatures comparable to the dust temperatures.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1539v2,Turbulent formation of protogalaxies at the plasma to gas transition,"  The standard model of gravitational structure formation is based on the Jeans
1902 acoustic theory, neglecting crucial effects of viscosity, turbulence and
diffusion. A Jeans length scale L_J emerges that exceeds the scale of causal
connection ct during the plasma epoch. Photon-viscous forces initially dominate
all others including gravity. The first structures formed were at density
minima by fragmentation when the viscous-gravitional scale L_SV matched ct at
30,000 years to produce protosupercluster voids and protosuperclusters. Weak
turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries guides the morphology of
smaller fragments down to protogalaxy size just before transition to gas at
300,000 years. The observed 10^20 meter size of protogalaxies reflects the
plasma Kolmogorov scale with Nomura linear and spiral morphology. On transition
to gas the kinematic viscosity decreases so the protogalaxies fragment into
Jeans scale clouds, each with a trillion earth-mass planets. The planets form
stars near the cores of the protogalaxies. High resolution images of planetary
nebula and supernova remnants reveal thousands of frozen hydrogen-helium dark
matter planets. Galaxy mergers show frictional trails of young globular
clusters formed in place, proving that dark matter halos of galaxies consist of
dark matter planets in metastable clumps.

surveyed for water maser emission (123 detections and 3806 non-detections) with
the SDSS low-redshift galaxy sample (z<0.05). Out of 1636 galaxies with SDSS
photometry, we identify 48 detections; out of the 1063 galaxies that also have

is higher at higher optical luminosity (M_B), larger velocity dispersion
($\sigma$), and higher [OIII]5007 luminosity, with [OIII]5007 being the
dominant factor. These detection rates are essentially the result of the
correlations of isotropic maser luminosity with all three of these variables.
These correlations are natural if maser strength increases with central black
hole mass and the level of AGN activity. We also find that the detection rate
is higher in galaxies with higher extinction. Based on these results, we
propose that maser surveys seeking to efficiently find masers should rank AGN
targets by extinction-corrected [OIII]5007 flux when available. This
prioritization would improve maser detection efficiency, from an overall ~ 3%

  Cosmic X-Ray Backgrounds","  Observations of local star forming galaxies have revealed a correlation
between the rate at which galaxies form stars and their X-Ray luminosity. We
combine this correlation with the most recent observational constraints on the
integrated star formation rate density, and find that star forming galaxies
account for 5-20% of the total soft and hard X-ray backgrounds, where the
precise number depends on the energy band and the assumed average X-ray
spectral energy distribution of the galaxies below ~20 keV. If we combine the
L_X-SFR relation with recently derived star formation rate function, then we
find that star forming galaxies whose X-ray flux falls well (more than a factor
of 10) below the detection thresholds of the Chandra Deep Fields, can fully
account for the unresolved soft X-ray background, which corresponds to ~6% of
its total. Motivated by this result, we put limits on the allowed redshift
evolution of the parameter c_X \equiv L_X/SFR, and/or its evolution towards
lower and higher star formation rates. If we parametrize the redshift evolution
of c_X ~ (1+z)^b, then we find that b \leq 1.3 (95% CL). On the other hand, the
observed X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of star forming galaxies indicate
that c_X may be increasing towards higher redshifts and/or higher star
formation rates at levels that are consistent with the X-ray background, but
possibly at odds with the locally observed L_X-SFR relation.

We find four stars to be carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, confirming
the trend of increasing [C/Fe] abundance ratios with decreasing metallicity.
Two of these objects can be classified as CEMP-no stars, adding to the growing
number of these objects at [Fe/H]<-3. We also find four neutron-capture
enhanced stars in the sample, one of which has [Eu/Fe] of 0.8 with clear
r-process signatures. These pilot sample stars are the most metal-poor
([Fe/H]<-3.0) of the brightest stars included in CASH and are used to calibrate

~800 K. The distance to NSV 11154 is estimated to be ~14.5 kpc. RCB stars are
very rare in the Galaxy so each additional star is important to population

The mean brightness level was stable before and after the outburst, and

correlation between rest-frame absorption equivalent width of MgII absorbers,
Wr(2796), and mean associated [OII] luminosity, L_[OII], in SDSS QSO spectra.
We demonstrate based on a Monte Carlo simulation that the observed Wr(2796) vs.
L_[OII] correlation of MgII absorbers can be well-reproduced, if all galaxies
found in deep surveys possess extended MgII halos and if the extent of MgII
halos scales proportionally with galaxy mass as shown in previous studies. The
observed correlation can be explained by a combination of (1) the known
Wr(2796) vs. rho anti-correlation in galaxy and MgII absorber pairs and (2) an
increasing aperture loss in the 3"" diameter SDSS fiber for galaxies at larger
rho. Galaxies at larger projected distances produce on average weaker MgII
absorbers and weaker (or zero) L_[OII] in SDSS QSO spectra. We show that such
correlation diminishes when larger fibers are adopted and is therefore not
physical. While under a simple halo model the majority of MgII absorbers do not
directly probe star-forming disks, they trace photo-ionized halo gas associated
with galaxies. We show that because of the scaling relation between extended

only on global disk properties, not the microphysics of feedback. In
simulations without stellar feedback, clumps turn an order-unity fraction of
their mass into stars and sink to the center, forming a large bulge and kicking
most of the stars out into a much more extended stellar envelope. By contrast,
strong radiative stellar feedback disrupts even the most massive clumps after
they turn ~10-20% of their mass into stars, in a timescale of ~10-100 Myr,
ejecting some material into a super-wind and recycling the rest of the gas into
the diffuse ISM. This suppresses the bulge formation rate by direct 'clump
coalescence' by a factor of several. However, the galactic disks do undergo
significant internal evolution in the absence of mergers: clumps form and
disrupt continuously and torque gas to the galactic center. The resulting
evolution is qualitatively similar to bar/spiral evolution in simulations with

flare that recurs every ~50-100 seconds, but the profile and duration of the
flares varies significantly from observation to observation. Based on a
comprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the RXTE archive, we
demonstrate that very different X-ray lightcurves do not require origins in
different accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the
phase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked
oscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray
spectral evolution. We argue that all heartbeat oscillations can be understood
as the result of a combination of a thermal-viscous radiation pressure
instability, a local Eddington limit in the disk, and a sudden,
radiation-pressure-driven evaporation or ejection event in the inner accretion
disk. This ejection appears to be a universal, fundamental part of the rho
state, and is largely responsible for a hard X-ray pulse seen in the lightcurve
of all cycles. We suggest that the detailed shape of oscillations in the mass
accretion rate through the disk is responsible for the phenomenological
differences between different rho-type lightcurves, and we discuss how future
time-dependent simulations of disk instabilities may provide new insights into
the role of radiation pressure in the accretion flow.

  Theory, Analytical Solutions and Observational Signatures","  Bubbles in the interstellar medium are produced by astrophysical sources,
which continuously or explosively deposit large amount of energy into the
ambient medium. These expanding bubbles can drive shocks in front of them,
which dynamics is markedly different from the widely used Sedov-von
Neumann-Taylor blast wave solution. Here we present the theory of a
bubble-driven shock and show how its properties and evolution are determined by
the temporal history of the source energy output, generally referred to as the
source luminosity law, $L(t)$. In particular, we find the analytical solutions
for a driven shock in two cases: the self-similar scaling $L\propto (t/t_s)^p$
law (with $p$ and $t_s$ being constants) and the finite activity time case,
$L\propto (1-t/t_s)^{-p}$. The latter with $p>0$ describes a
finite-time-singular behavior, which is relevant to a wide variety of systems
with explosive-type energy release. For both luminosity laws, we derived the
conditions needed for the driven shock to exist and predict the shock
observational signatures. Our results can be relevant to stellar systems with
strong winds, merging neutron star/magnetar/black hole systems, and massive
stars evolving to supernovae explosions.

  Binaries","  Merging binaries of compact relativistic objects (neutron stars and black
holes) are thought to be progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts and sources of
gravitational waves, hence their study is of great importance for astrophysics.
Because of the strong magnetic field of one or both binary members and high
orbital frequencies, these binaries are strong sources of energy in the form of
Poynting flux (e.g., magnetic-field-dominated outflows, relativistic leptonic
winds, electromagnetic and plasma waves). The steady injection of energy by the
binary forms a bubble (or a cavity) filled with matter with the relativistic
equation of state, which pushes on the surrounding plasma and can drive a shock
wave in it. Unlike the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave solution for a
point-like explosion, the shock wave here is continuously driven by the
ever-increasing pressure inside the bubble. We calculate from the first
principles the dynamics and evolution of the bubble and the shock surrounding
it and predict that such systems can be observed as radio sources a few hours
before and after the merger. At much later times, the shock is expected to
settle onto the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution, thus resembling an
explosion.

the US and Auto Windscreen in the UK. Software and other IT is now such an
integral part of most business processes and products that CEOs must know their
IT risks, which are typically substantial and overlooked. The analysis of a

that figure masks a far more alarming 'fat tail' risk. Fully one in six of the
projects in the sample was a Black Swan, with a cost overrun of 200%, on
average, and a schedule overrun of almost 70%. This highlights the true pitfall
of IT change initiatives: It's not that they're particularly prone to high cost
overruns on average - it is that there are a disproportionate number of Black
Swans. By focusing on averages instead of the more damaging outliers, most
managers and consultants have been missing the real risk in doing IT. In
conclusion, the article outlines ideas as to what can be done to avoid Black

likelihood parameter estimation in state-space models which only requires being
able to simulate the latent Markov model according to its prior distribution.
Their methodology relies on an approximation of the score vector for general
statistical models based upon an artificial posterior distribution and bypasses
the calculation of any derivative. We show here that this score estimator can
be derived from a simple application of Stein's lemma and how an additional
application of this lemma provides an original derivative-free estimator of the

robustness properties compared to finite difference estimators while their bias
and variance scale as well as finite difference type estimators, including
simultaneous perturbations (see e.g. Spall, IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control

where sequential Monte Carlo computation is required, these estimators can be
further improved. In this specific context, we derive original derivative-free
estimators of the score vector and observed information matrix which are
computed using sequential Monte Carlo approximations of smoothed additive
functionals associated with a modified version of the original state-space

availability of master events. For the purposes of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, cross correlation can globally reduce the threshold
monitoring by 0.3 to 0.4 magnitude units. In seismically active regions, the
optimal choice of master events is straightforward. There are two approaches to
populate the global grid in aseismic areas: the replication of real masters and
synthetic seismograms calculated for seismic arrays of the International
Monitoring System. Synthetic templates depend on the accuracy of shape and
amplitude predictions controlled by focal depth and mechanism, source function,
velocity structure and attenuation along the master/station path. As in Part I,
we test three focal mechanisms (explosion, thrust fault, and actual Harvard CMT
solution for one of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera aftershocks) and two velocity
structures (ak135 and CRUST 2.0). Sixteen synthetic master events were
distributed over a 1ox1o grid. We built five cross correlation standard event
lists (XSEL) and compared detections and events with those built using the real
and grand master events as well as with the Reviewed Event Bulletin of the
International Data Centre. The XSELs built using the source of explosion and
ak135 and the reverse fault with isotropic radiation pattern demonstrate the
performance similar to that of the real and grand masters. Therefore, it is
possible to cover all aseismic areas with synthetic masters without significant
loss in seismic monitoring capabilities based on cross correlation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5471v1,Relativistic Reconnection: an Efficient Source of Non-Thermal Particles,"  In magnetized astrophysical outflows, the dissipation of field energy into
particle energy via magnetic reconnection is often invoked to explain the
observed non-thermal signatures. By means of two- and three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate anti-parallel reconnection in
magnetically-dominated electron-positron plasmas. Our simulations extend to
unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial scales, so we can capture the
asymptotic state of the system beyond the initial transients, and without any
artificial limitation by the boundary conditions. At late times, the
reconnection layer is organized into a chain of large magnetic islands
connected by thin X-lines. The plasmoid instability further fragments each
X-line into a series of smaller islands, separated by X-points. At the
X-points, the particles become unmagnetized and they get accelerated along the
reconnection electric field. We provide definitive evidence that the late-time
particle spectrum integrated over the whole reconnection region is a power-law,
whose slope is harder than -2 for magnetizations sigma>10. Efficient particle
acceleration to non-thermal energies is a generic by-product of the long-term
evolution of relativistic reconnection in both two and three dimensions. In
three dimensions, the drift-kink mode corrugates the reconnection layer at
early times, but the long-term evolution is controlled by the plasmoid
instability, that facilitates efficient particle acceleration, in analogy to
the two-dimensional physics. Our findings have important implications for the
generation of hard photon spectra in pulsar winds and relativistic
astrophysical jets.

expected to undergo close approaches, the outcomes of the most violent
encounters might leave an imprint on the discs and host stars that will
influence both their orbits and their ability to form planets. We first
construct well-behaved 3-D models of self-gravitating discs, and then create a
suite of numerical experiments of parabolic encounters, exploring the effects
of pericenter separation r_p, disc orientation and disc-star mass ratio
(M_d/M_*) on the orbital evolution of the host stars. Close encounters (2r_p<~
disc radius) can truncate discs on very short time scales. If discs are
massive, close encounters facilitate enough orbital angular momentum extraction
to induce stellar capture. We find that for realistic primordial disc masses
M_d<~0.1M_*, non-colliding encounters induce minor orbital changes, which is
consistent with analytic calculations of encounters in the linear regime. The
same disc masses produce entirely different results for grazing/colliding
encounters. In the latter case, rapidly cooling discs lose orbital energy by
radiating away the energy excess of the shock-heated gas, thus causing capture
of the host stars into a bound orbit. In rare cases, a tight binary with a

LFs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift

natural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regions

at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined
small group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. We
contrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/disk

accretion disk. Non-imaging algorithms are developed that use interferometric
closure quantities to test for periodicity, and applied to an ensemble of
hot-spot models that sample a range of parameter space. We find that structural
periodicity in a wide range of cases can be detected on most potential VLBI
arrays using modern VLBI instrumentation. Future enhancements of mm/sub-mm VLBI
arrays including phased array processors to aggregate VLBI station collecting
area, increased bandwidth recording, and addition of new VLBI sites all
significantly aid periodicity detection. The methods described herein can be
applied to other models of Sagittarius A*, including jet outflows and
Magneto-Hydrodynamic accretion simulations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4262v2,Star Clusters Around Recoiled Black Holes in the Milky Way Halo,"  Gravitational wave emission by coalescing black holes (BHs) kicks the remnant
BH with a typical velocity of hundreds of km/s. This velocity is sufficiently
large to remove the remnant BH from a low-mass galaxy but is below the escape
velocity from the Milky Way (MW) galaxy. If central BHs were common in the
galactic building blocks that merged to make the MW, then numerous BHs that
were kicked out of low-mass galaxies should be freely floating in the MW halo
today. We use a large statistical sample of possible merger tree histories for
the MW to estimate the expected number of recoiled BH remnants present in the
MW halo today. We find that hundreds of BHs should remain bound to the MW halo
after leaving their parent low-mass galaxies. Each BH carries a compact cluster
of old stars that populated the core of its original host galaxy. Using the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation, we find that present-day clusters are ~<
1 pc in size, and their central bright regions should be unresolved in most
existing sky surveys. These compact systems are distinguishable from globular
clusters by their internal (Keplerian) velocity dispersion greater than one
hundred km/s and their high mass-to-light ratio owing to the central BH. An
observational discovery of this relic population of star clusters in the MW
halo, would constrain the formation history of the MW and the dynamics of BH
mergers in the early Universe. A similar population should exist around other
galaxies, and may potentially be detectable in M31 and M33.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4489v2,Using Millimeter VLBI to Constrain RIAF Models of Sagittarius A*,"  The recent detection of Sagittarius A* at lambda = 1.3 mm on a baseline from
Hawaii to Arizona demonstrates that millimeter wavelength very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) can now spatially resolve emission from the innermost
accretion flow of the Galactic center region. Here, we investigate the ability
of future millimeter VLBI arrays to constrain the spin and inclination of the
putative black hole and the orientation of the accretion disk major axis within
the context of radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We examine
the range of baseline visibility and closure amplitudes predicted by RIAF
models to identify critical telescopes for determining the spin, inclination,
and disk orientation of the Sgr A* black hole and accretion disk system. We
find that baseline lengths near 3 gigalambda have the greatest power to
distinguish amongst RIAF model parameters, and that it will be important to
include new telescopes that will form north-south baselines with a range of
lengths. If a RIAF model describes the emission from Sgr A*, it is likely that
the orientation of the accretion disk can be determined with the addition of a
Chilean telescope to the array. Some likely disk orientations predict
detectable fluxes on baselines between the continental United States and even a
single 10-12 m dish in Chile. The extra information provided from closure
amplitudes by a four-antenna array enhances the ability of VLBI to discriminate
amongst model parameters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0573v2,Pulsar-Black Hole Binaries in the Galactic Center,"  Binaries consisting of a pulsar and a black hole (BH) are a holy grail of
astrophysics, both for their significance for stellar evolution and for their
potential application as probes of strong gravity. In spite of extensive
surveys of our Galaxy and its system of globular clusters, no pulsar-black hole
(PSR-BH) binary has been found to date. Clues as to where such systems might
exist are therefore highly desirable. We show that if the central parsec around
Sgr A* harbors a cluster of ~25,000 stellar BHs (as predicted by mass
segregation arguments) and if it is also rich in recycled pulsar binaries (by
analogy with globular clusters), then 3-body exchange interactions should
produce PSR-BHs in the Galactic center. Simple estimates of the formation rate
and survival time of these binaries suggest that a few PSR-BHs should be
present in the central parsec today. The proposed formation mechanism makes
unique predictions for the PSR-BH properties: 1) the binary would reside within
~1 pc of Sgr A*; 2) the pulsar would be recycled, with a period of ~1 to a few
tens of milliseconds, and a low magnetic field B<~10^10 G; 3) the binary would
have high eccentricity, e~0.8, but with a large scatter; and 4) the binary
would be relatively wide, with semi-major axis a_b~0.1 - >~3 AU. The potential
discovery of a PSR-BH binary therefore provides a strong motivation for deep,
high-frequency radio searches for recycled pulsars toward the Galactic center.

between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar
parameters from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (Lee et al. 2008a). We
achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29 mmag in the colors u-g, g-r, r-i,
and i-z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type
and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements
confirm our earlier ""blue tip"" reddening measurements (Schlafly et al. 2010,

g-r, r-i, and i-z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4%
normalization difference. These results prefer an R_V=3.1 Fitzpatrick (1999)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5519v1,Primordial Planet Formation,"  Recent spacecraft observations exploring solar system properties impact
standard paradigms of the formation of stars, planets and comets. We stress the
unexpected cloud of microscopic dust resulting from the DEEP IMPACT mission,
and the existence of molten nodules in STARDUST samples. And the theory of star
formation does not explain the common occurrence of binary and multiple star
systems in the standard gas fragmentation scenario. No current theory of planet
formation can explain the iron core of the earth, under oceans of water.
  These difficulties are avoided in a scenario where the planet mass objects
form primordially and are today the baryonic dark matter. They have been
detected in quasar microlensing and anomalous quasar radio brightening bursts.
The primordial planets often concentrate together to form a star, with residual
matter seen in pre-stellar accretion discs around the youngest stars.
  These primordial planet mass bodies were formed of hydrogen-helium,
aggregated in dense clumps of a trillion at the time of plasma neutralization
380,000 years after the big bang. Most have been frozen and invisible, but are
now manifesting themselves in numerous ways as sensitive modern space
telescopes become operational. Their key detection signature is their thermal
emission spectrum, pegged at the 13.8 degrees Kelvin triple point of hydrogen,

the plasma to gas transition 300,000 years after the big bang in
million-star-mass clumps. Stars may form in the clumps by mergers of the
planets to make globular star clusters. Star-less clumps persist as the dark
matter of galaxies as observed by Schild in 1996 using quasar microlensing, and
as predicted by Gibson in 1996 using fluid mechanics. Massive plasma
structures, at 10^46 kg proto-galaxy-cluster-mass, fragment at 30,000 years
when photon-viscous forces match gravitational fragmentation forces at the
horizon scale ct of the expanding universe, where c is the speed of light and t
is the time. Spinning proto-super-cluster-void and proto-galaxy-void boundaries
expand at sound speeds c/3^1/2 producing weak turbulence and linear-clusters of
gas-proto-galaxies that are fossils of turbulent-plasma vortex lines.
Hubble-space-telescope images of the most distant galaxies support this Gamov

anisotropies are interpreted as evidence of a turbulent big bang. A cosmic
distribution of life is attributed to hot water oceans of the interacting

http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1005v3,The signature of the first stars in atomic hydrogen at redshift 20,"  Dark and baryonic matter moved at different velocities in the early Universe,
which strongly suppressed star formation in some regions. This was estimated to
imprint a large-scale fluctuation signal of about 2 mK in the 21-cm spectral
line of atomic hydrogen associated with stars at a redshift of 20, although
this estimate ignored the critical contribution of gas heating due to X-rays
and major enhancements of the suppression. A large velocity difference reduces
the abundance of halos and requires the first stars to form in halos of about a
million solar masses, substantially greater than previously expected. Here we
report a simulation of the distribution of the first stars at z=20 (cosmic age
of ~180 Myr), incorporating all these ingredients within a 400 Mpc box. We find
that the 21-cm signature of these stars is an enhanced (10 mK) fluctuation
signal on the 100-Mpc scale, characterized by a flat power spectrum with
prominent baryon acoustic oscillations. The required sensitivity to see this
signal is achievable with an integration time of a thousand hours with an
instrument like the Murchison Wide-field Array or the Low Frequency Array but
designed to operate in the range of 50-100 MHz.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1006v2,On the Mass Distribution and Birth Masses of Neutron Stars,"  We investigate the distribution of neutron star masses in different
populations of binaries, employing Bayesian statistical techniques. In
particular, we explore the differences in neutron star masses between sources
that have experienced distinct evolutionary paths and accretion episodes. We
find that the distribution of neutron star masses in non-recycled eclipsing
high-mass binaries as well as of slow pulsars, which are all believed to be
near their birth masses, has a mean of 1.28 M_solar and a dispersion of 0.24
M_solar. These values are consistent with expectations for neutron star
formation in core-collapse supernovae. On the other hand, double neutron stars,
which are also believed to be near their birth masses, have a much narrower
mass distribution, peaking at 1.33 M_solar but with a dispersion of only 0.05
M_solar. Such a small dispersion cannot easily be understood and perhaps points
to a particular and rare formation channel. The mass distribution of neutron
stars that have been recycled has a mean of 1.48 M_solar and a dispersion of
0.2 M_solar, consistent with the expectation that they have experienced
extended mass accretion episodes. The fact that only a very small fraction of
recycled neutron stars in the inferred distribution have masses that exceed ~2
M_solar suggests that only a few of these neutron stars cross the mass
threshold to form low mass black holes.

J102915 + 172927 cannot be explained using the standard cold dark matter CDM
theory of star formation, but are easily understood using the Gibson/Schild
1996 hydrogravitationaldynamics (HGD) theory. From HGD, primordial H-4He gas
fragments into Earth-mass planets in trillion-planet
proto-globular-star-cluster (PGC) clumps at the 300 Kyr time of transition from
the plasma epoch, soon after the big bang. The first HGD stars formed from
pristine, frictionally-merging, gas-planets within the gently stressed clumps
of the early universe, burning most available lithium in brown-dwarfs and
hot-stars before creating metals that permit cooler burning. The Caffau halo
star is a present day example. CDM first stars (Population III) were massive
and promptly exploded, reionizing the gas of the universe and seeding it with
metals, thus making the observed star unexplainable. From HGD, CDM and its
massive first stars, and re-ionization by Pop III supernovae, never happened.
All stars are formed from planets in primordial clumps. HGD first stars (Pop
III) were small and long-lived, and the largest ones were hot. We suggest such
small HGD (Pop III) stars still form in the gently stressed Galaxy halo.

around each group center and \sim100 kpc long spiral tails in both groups. Most
interestingly, the cold fronts are highly distorted in both groups, exhibiting
'wings' along the fronts. These features resemble the structures predicted from
non-viscous hydrodynamic simulations of gas sloshing, where Kelvin-Helmholtz

cold fronts, but the NGC 7618/UGC 12491 pair are two in a growing number of

and/or viscosity may be able to suppress the growth of KHIs at the cold fronts

population in galactic nuclei. Stars crossing the line of site in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) produce a characteristic transit lightcurve, just like
extrasolar planets do when they transit their host star. We examine the
possibility of finding such AGN transits in deep optical, UV, and X-ray
surveys. We calculate transit lightcurves using the Novikov--Thorne thin
accretion disk model, including general relatistic effects. Based on the
expected properties of stellar cusps, we find that around 10^6 solar mass
SMBHs, transits of red giants are most common for stars on close orbits with
transit durations of a few weeks and orbital periods of a few years. We find
that detecting AGN transits requires repeated observations of thousands of low
mass AGNs to 1% photometric accuracy in optical, or ~ 10% in UV bands or soft
X-ray. It may be possible to identify stellar transits in the Pan-STARRS and
LSST optical and the eROSITA X-ray surveys. Such observations could be used to
constrain black hole mass, spin, inclination and accretion rate. Transit rates
and durations could give valuable information on the circumnuclear stellar
clusters as well. Transit lightcurves could be used to image accretion disks
with unprecedented resolution, allowing to resolve the SMBH silhouette in
distant AGNs.

which can be reduced to one free parameter when we fit the two bias parameters
to simulations results. We can differentiate degenerate combinations of the
bias parameters by combining results for the global ionization histories and
correlation length between ionized regions. Unlike previous semi-analytic
models, the evolution of the reionization-redshift field in our model is
directly compared cell by cell against simulations and preforms well in all

Matter paradigm only if it is able to substantially reduce the central
densities of dwarf-size haloes while keeping the densities and shapes of
cluster-size haloes within current constraints. Given the seemingly stringent
nature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a decade that SIDM would be
viable only if the cross section for self-scattering was strongly
velocity-dependent. However, it has recently been suggested that a constant
cross section per unit mass of sigma_T/m~0.1cm^2/g is sufficient to accomplish
the desired effect. We explicitly investigate this claim using high resolution
cosmological simulations of a Milky-Way size halo and find that, similarly to
the Cold Dark Matter case, such cross section produces a population of massive
subhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the classical dwarf
spheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of the mass profiles of
Fornax and Sculptor. This problem is resolved if sigma_T/m~1cm^2/g at the dwarf

the mass-radius diagrams. Given the mass and radius input, these contours can
be used to quickly determine the important physical properties of a planet
including its p0 (central pressure), p1/p0 (core-mantle boundary pressure over
central pressure), CMF (core mass fraction) or CRF (core radius fraction). For

  Relativistic Spacetimes","  We introduce GRay, a massively parallel integrator designed to trace the
trajectories of billions of photons in a curved spacetime. This GPU-based
integrator employs the stream processing paradigm, is implemented in CUDA
C/C++, and runs on nVidia graphics cards. The peak performance of GRay using
single precision floating-point arithmetic on a single GPU exceeds 300 GFLOP
(or 1 nanosecond per photon per time step). For a realistic problem, where the
peak performance cannot be reached, GRay is two orders of magnitude faster than
existing CPU-based ray tracing codes. This performance enhancement allows more
effective searches of large parameter spaces when comparing theoretical
predictions of images, spectra, and lightcurves from the vicinities of compact
objects to observations. GRay can also perform on-the-fly ray tracing within
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic algorithms that simulate accretion
flows around compact objects. Making use of this algorithm, we calculate the
properties of the shadows of Kerr black holes and the photon rings that
surround them. We also provide accurate fitting formulae of their dependencies
on black hole spin and observer inclination, which can be used to interpret
upcoming observations of the black holes at the center of the Milky Way, as
well as M87, with the Event Horizon Telescope.

near-IR observations of the short-hard GRB130603B at z=0.356, which demonstrate
the presence of excess near-IR emission matching the expected brightness and
color of an r-process powered transient (a ""kilonova""). The early afterglow
fades rapidly with alpha<-2.6 at t~8-32 hr post-burst and has a spectral index
of beta=-1.5 (F_nu t^alpha*nu^beta), leading to an expected near-IR brightness
at the time of the first HST observation of m(F160W)>29.3 AB mag. Instead, the
detected source has m(F160W)=25.8+/-0.2 AB mag, corresponding to a rest-frame
absolute magnitude of M(J)=-15.2 mag. The upper limit in the HST optical
observations is m(F606W)>27.7 AB mag (3-sigma), indicating an unusually red
color of V-H>1.9 mag. Comparing the observed near-IR luminosity to theoretical
models of kilonovae produced by ejecta from the merger of an NS-NS or NS-BH
binary, we infer an ejecta mass of M_ej~0.03-0.08 Msun for v_ej=0.1-0.3c. The
inferred mass matches the expectations from numerical merger simulations. The
presence of a kilonova provides the strongest evidence to date that short GRBs
are produced by compact object mergers, and provides initial insight on the
ejected mass and the primary role that compact object merger may play in the
r-process. Equally important, it demonstrates that gravitational wave sources
detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo will be accompanied by optical/near-IR
counterparts with unusually red colors, detectable by existing and upcoming
large wide-field facilities (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DECam, Subaru, LSST).

such heating ineffective, resulting in a delayed and spatially uniform heating
that modifies the 21-cm signature of reionization. Rather than looking for a
simple rise and fall of the large-scale fluctuations (peaking at several
millikelvin), we must expect a more complex signal also featuring a distinct
minimum (at less than a millikelvin) that marks the rise of the cosmic mean gas

imaging (DSI) schemes (e.g., USC-Harvard consortium). However, these data sets
are not readily accessible to high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)
analysis methods that are popular in connectomics analysis. Here we introduce a
scheme conversion approach that transforms multishell and DSI data into their
corresponding HARDI representations, thereby empowering HARDI-based analytical
methods to make use of data acquired using non-HARDI approaches. This method
was evaluated on both phantom and in-vivo human data sets by acquiring
multishell, DSI, and HARDI data simultaneously, and comparing the converted
HARDI, from non-HARDI methods, with the original HARDI data. Analysis on the
phantom shows that the converted HARDI from DSI and multishell data strongly
predicts the original HARDI (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Our in-vivo study
shows that the converted HARDI can be reconstructed by constrained spherical
deconvolution, and the fiber orientation distributions are consistent with
those from the original HARDI. We further illustrate that our scheme conversion
method can be applied to HCP data, and the converted HARDI do not appear to
sacrifice angular resolution. Thus this novel approach can benefit all
HARDI-based analysis approaches, allowing greater analytical accessibility to

  Shocks. II. Firehose-Mediated Fermi Acceleration and its Dependence on
  Pre-Shock Conditions","  Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies is known to occur in low Mach
number (M<5) shocks in galaxy clusters and solar flares, but the electron
acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional (2D)
particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, we showed in Paper I that electrons
are efficiently accelerated in low Mach number (M=3) quasi-perpendicular shocks
via a Fermi-like process. The electrons bounce between the upstream region and
the shock front, with each reflection at the shock resulting in energy gain via
shock drift acceleration. The upstream scattering is provided by oblique
magnetic waves, that are self-generated by the electrons escaping ahead of the
shock. In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address
the nature of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated
by the shock-reflected electrons via the firehose instability, which is driven
by an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution. We systematically
explore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration
depend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or
equivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature. We find
that the mechanism works for shocks with high plasma beta (>20) at nearly all
magnetic field obliquities, and for electron temperatures in the range relevant
for galaxy clusters. Our findings offer a natural solution to the conflict
between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of
galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration efficiency usually expected
in low Mach number shocks.

that the predicted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen contains enough information
to reconstruct $\tau$ with sub-percent accuracy, assuming that the neutral gas

we relax this assumption and use the global 21-cm signal alone to extract
$\tau$ for realistic X-ray heating scenarios. We test our model-independent
approach using mock data for a wide range of ionization and heating histories
and show that an accurate measurement of the reionization optical depth at a
sub-percent level is possible in most of the considered scenarios even when
heating is not saturated during the epoch of reionization, assuming that the
foregrounds are mitigated. However, we find that in cases where heating sources
had hard X-ray spectra and their luminosity was close to or lower than what is

collapse of a pristine gas cloud directly into a massive, M_BH=10^4-10^6 M_sun
black hole. In this paper we show that large HI column densities of primordial
gas at T~10^4 K with low molecular abundance - which represent key aspects of
the DCBH scenario - provide optimal conditions for pumping of the 2p-level of
atomic hydrogen by trapped Lyman alpha (Lya) photons. This Lya pumping
mechanism gives rise to inverted level population of the 2s_1/2-2p_3/2
transition, and therefore to stimulated fine structure emission at 3.04 cm

CMB by up to a factor of 10^5, above which the maser saturates. Hyperfine
splitting of the 3-cm transition gives rise to a characteristic broad (FWHM ~
tens of MHz in the observers frame) asymmetric line profile. This signal
subtends an angular scale of ~ 1-10 mas, which translates to a flux of ~ 0.3-3
microJy, which is detectable with ultra-deep surveys being planned with
SKA1-MID. While challenging, as the signal is visible for a fraction of the
collapse time of the cloud, the matching required physical conditions imply
that a detection of the redshifted 3-cm emission line would provide direct

accelerate the spacecraft's own fuel, resulting in only a logarithmic gain in
maximum speed as propellant is added to the spacecraft. Light sails offer an
attractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with
acceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially
illuminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by
the area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the
accelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail
propulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be
detectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave
beam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around
a single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz.
Leakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and
durations of tens of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary
system would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system,
multiply-transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of
detection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed
from Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly
employed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of
nearby transiting exoplanetary systems. The expected signal properties define a

mechanically degenerate. A single sample of ultracondensed hydrogen has been
made at an estimated pressure of 495 GPa at 5.5 K. Whether that sample is solid

them the mixing at shear flow interfaces due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI). The observed structure of potential mixing layers can be
used to infer the transport coefficients, but the data interpretation requires
a detailed knowledge of the long-term evolution of the KHI under different
conditions. Here we present the first systematic numerical study of the effect
of constant and temperature-dependent isotropic viscosity over the full range
of possible values. We show that moderate viscosities slow down the growth of
the KHI and reduce the height of the KHI rolls and their rolling-up.
Viscosities above a critical value suppress the KHI. The effect can be
quantified in terms of the Reynolds number Re = U{\lambda}/{\nu}, where U is
the shear velocity, {\lambda} the perturbation length, and {\nu} the kinematic
viscosity. We derive the critical Re for constant and temperature dependent,
Spitzer-like viscosities, an empirical relation for the viscous KHI growth time
as a function of Re and density contrast, and describe special behaviours for
Spitzer-like viscosities and high density contrasts. Finally, we briefly
discuss several astrophysical situations where the viscous KHI could play a
role, i.e., sloshing cold fronts, gas stripping from galaxies, buoyant
cavities, ICM turbulence, and high velocity clouds.

  incorporating the light cone effect","  We present predictions for the 21 cm brightness temperature power spectrum
during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We discuss the implications of the
""light cone"" effect, which incorporates evolution of the neutral hydrogen
fraction and 21 cm brightness temperature along the line of sight. Using a
novel method calibrated against radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we model
the neutral hydrogen density field and 21 cm signal in large volumes ($L = 2$
Gpc/$h$). The inclusion of the light cone effect leads to a relative decrease
of about 50% in the 21 cm power spectrum on all scales. We also find that the
effect is more prominent at the midpoint of reionization and later. The light
cone effect also can introduce an anisotropy along the line of sight. By
decomposing the 3D power spectrum into components perpendicular to and along
the line of sight, we find that in our fiducial reionization model, there is no
significant anisotropy. However, parallel modes can contribute up to 40% more
power for shorter reionization scenarios. The scales on which the light cone
effect is relevant are comparable to scales where one measures the baryon
acoustic oscillation. We argue that due to its large comoving scale and
introduction of anisotropy, the light cone effect is important when considering
redshift space distortions and future application to the Alcock-Paczynski test
for the determination of cosmological parameters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6550v2,Planet-disc interaction on a freely moving mesh,"  General-purpose, moving-mesh schemes for hydrodynamics have opened the
possibility of combining the accuracy of grid-based numerical methods with the
flexibility and automatic resolution adaptivity of particle-based methods. Due
to their supersonic nature, Keplerian accretion discs are in principle a very
attractive system for applying such freely moving mesh techniques. However, the
high degree of symmetry of simple accretion disc models can be difficult to
capture accurately by these methods, due to the generation of geometric grid
noise and associated numerical diffusion, which is absent in polar grids. To
explore these and other issues, in this work we study the idealized problem of
two-dimensional planet-disc interaction with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We
explore the hydrodynamic evolution of discs with planets through a series of
numerical experiments that vary the planet mass, the disc viscosity and the
mesh resolution, and compare the resulting surface density, vortensity field
and tidal torque with results from the literature. We find that the performance
of the moving-mesh code in this problem is in accordance with published
results, showing good consistency with grid codes written in polar coordinates.
We also conclude that grid noise and mesh distortions do not introduce
excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, we show how the moving-mesh approach
can naturally increase resolution in regions of high densityaround planets and
planetary wakes, while retaining the background flow at low resolution. This
provides an alternative to the difficult task of implementing adaptive mesh
refinement in conventional polar-coordinate codes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5022v2,The Fastest Unbound Stars in the Universe,"  The discovery of hypervelocity stars (HVS) leaving our galaxy with speeds of
nearly $10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ has provided strong evidence towards the existence
of a massive compact object at the galaxy's center. HVS ejected via the
disruption of stellar binaries can occasionally yield a star with $v_{\infty}
\lesssim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$, here we show that this mechanism can be extended to
massive black hole (MBH) mergers, where the secondary star is replaced by a MBH
with mass $M_2 \gtrsim 10^5 M_{\odot}$. We find that stars that are originally
bound to the secondary MBH are frequently ejected with $v_{\infty} > 10^4$ km
s$^{-1}$, and occasionally with velocities $\sim 10^5$ km s$^{-1}$ (one third
the speed of light), for this reason we refer to stars ejected from these
systems as ""semi-relativistic"" hypervelocity stars (SHS). Bound to no galaxy,
the velocities of these stars are so great that they can cross a significant
fraction of the observable universe in the time since their ejection (several
Gpc). We demonstrate that if a significant fraction of MBH mergers undergo a
phase in which their orbital eccentricity is $\gtrsim 0.5$ and their periapse
distance is tens of the primary's Schwarzschild radius, the space density of
fast-moving ($v_{\infty} > 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$) SHS may be as large as $10^{3}$
Mpc$^{-3}$. Hundreds of the SHS will be giant stars that could be detected by
future all-sky infrared surveys such as WFIRST or Euclid and proper motion
surveys such as LSST, with spectroscopic follow-up being possible with JWST.

CR ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm CR}\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. This low CR rate
is the first indication of the presence of CR exclusion by winds and/or
magnetic fields in an actively accreting T Tauri disk system. With this new
constraint, our best fit ionization structure predicts a low turbulence

  Lensing Models With an Eye Toward the Frontier Fields","  We test the effects of varying the cosmological parameter values used in the
strong lens modeling process for the six Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy
clusters. The standard procedure for generating high fidelity strong lens
models includes careful consideration of uncertainties in the output models
that result from varying model parameters within the bounds of available data
constraints. It is not, however, common practice to account for the effects of
cosmological parameter value uncertainties. The convention is to instead use a
single fiducial ""concordance cosmology"" and generate lens models assuming zero
uncertainty in cosmological parameter values. We find that the magnification
maps of the individual HFF clusters vary significantly when lens models are
computed using different cosmological parameter values taken from recent
literature constraints from space- and ground-based experiments. Specifically,
the magnification maps have average variances across the best fit models
computed using different cosmologies that are comparable in magnitude to - and
as much as 2.5 times larger than - the model fitting uncertainties in each best
fit model. We also find that estimates of the mass profiles of the cluster
cores themselves vary only slightly when different input cosmological
parameters are used. We conclude that cosmological parameter uncertainty is a
non-negligible source of uncertainty in lens model products for the HFF
clusters, and that it is important that current and future work which relies on
precision strong lensing models take care to account for this additional source

  gravitational lensing","  The observed properties of high redshift galaxies depend on the underlying
foreground distribution of large scale structure, which distorts their
intrinsic properties via gravitational lensing. We focus on the regime where
the dominant contribution originates from a single lens and examine the
statistics of gravitational lensing by a population of virialized and
non-virialized structures using sub-mm galaxies at z ~ 2.6 and Lyman-break
galaxies at redshifts z ~ 6 - 15 as the background sources. We quantify the
effect of lensing on the luminosity function of the high redshift sources,
focusing on the intermediate and small magnifications, mu < 2, which affect the
majority of the background galaxies, and comparing to the case of strong
lensing. We show that, depending on the intrinsic properties of the background
galaxies, gravitational lensing can significantly affect the observed
luminosity function even when no obvious strong lenses are present. Finally, we
find that in the case of the Lyman-break galaxies it is important to account
for the surface brightness profiles of both the foreground and the background
galaxies when computing the lensing statistics, which introduces a selection
criterion for the background galaxies that can actually be observed. Not taking
this criterion into account leads to an overestimation of the number densities

originally discovered with the INTEGRAL satellite: IGR J04059+5416 and IGR
J08297-4250. We use the Chandra X-ray Observatory to localize the sources and
then archival near-IR images to identify the counterparts. Both sources have
counterparts in the catalog of extended 2 Micron All-Sky Survey sources, and
the counterpart to IGR J04059+5416 has been previously identified as a galaxy.
Thus, we place IGR J04059+5416 in the class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
and we suggest that IGR J08297-4250 is also an AGN. If this identification is
correct, the near-IR images suggest that the host galaxy of IGR J08297-4250 may
be merging with a smaller nearby galaxy. For IGR J04059+5416, the 0.3-86 keV

of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays. We focus on particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation, and describe the recent progress in the field driven
by theory advances and by the rapid development of particle-in-cell (PIC)

field is nearly aligned with the flow), particle acceleration is efficient. The
accelerated particles stream ahead of the shock, where they generate strong
magnetic waves which in turn scatter the particles back and forth across the
shock, mediating their acceleration. In contrast, in strongly magnetized
quasi-perpendicular shocks, the efficiencies of both particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation are suppressed. Particle acceleration, when
efficient, modifies the turbulence around the shock on a long time scale, and
the accelerated particles have a characteristic energy spectral index of ~ 2.2
in the ultra-relativistic limit. We discuss how this novel understanding of
particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in relativistic shocks can
be applied to high-energy astrophysical phenomena, with an emphasis on PWNe and

kept declining along the superoutburst, and their increasing contrast with the
underlying continuum was simply the result of the faster decline of the
continuum compared to the emission lines. Inspection of historical Harvard

consider two effects that may have important ramifications for the development
of life in similar systems where a pair of planets may reside entirely in the
habitable zone of the hosting star. Specifically, we run numerical simulations
to determine whether strong, resonant (or non-resonant) planet-planet
interactions can cause large variations in planet obliquity---thereby inducing
large variations in climate. We also determine whether or not resonant
interactions affect the rate of lithopanspermia between the planet pair---which
could facilitate the growth and maintenance of life on both planets. We find
that first-order resonances do not cause larger obliquity variations compared
with non-resonant cases. We also find that resonant interactions are not a
primary consideration in lithopanspermia. Lithopanspermia is enhanced
significantly as the planet orbits come closer together---reaching nearly the
same rate as ejected material falling back to the surface of the originating
planet (assuming that the ejected material makes it out to the location of our
initial conditions). Thus, in both cases our results indicate that
close-proximity planet pairs in multihabitable systems are conducive to life in

rotated, ultracold Fermi gases. These superfluids can be described in terms of
an effective field theory for a macroscopic wave function representing the
field of condensed pairs, analogous to the Ginzburg-Landau theory for
superconductors. Here, we have established how rotation modifies this effective
field theory, by rederiving it starting from the action of Fermi gas in the
rotating frame of reference. The rotation leads to the appearance of an
effective vector potential, and the coupling strength of this vector potential
to the macroscopic wave function depends on the interaction strength between
the fermions, due to a renormalization of the pair effective mass in the
effective field theory. The mass renormalization derived here is in agreement
with results of functional renormalization group theory. In the extreme BEC
regime, the pair effective mass tends to twice the fermion mass, in agreement
with the physical picture of a weakly interacting Bose gas of molecular pairs.
Then, we use our macroscopic wave function description to study vortices and

mostly focus on the stellar debris that are bound to the system, because they
give rise to luminous flares. On the other hand, half of the stellar debris in
principle are unbound and can stream to a great distance, but so far there is
no clear evidence that this ""unbound debris stream"" (UDS) exists. Motivated by
the fact that the circum-nuclear region around SMBHs is usually filled with
dense molecular clouds (MCs), here we investigate the observational signatures
resulting from the collision between an UDS and a MC, which is likely to happen
hundreds of years after a TDE. We focus on $\gamma$-ray emission ($0.1-10^5$
GeV), which comes from the encounter of shock-accelerated cosmic rays with
background protons and, more importantly, is not subject to extinction. We show
that because of the high proton density inside a MC, the peak $\gamma$-ray
luminosity, about $10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, is at least $100$ times greater
than that in the case without a MC (only with a smooth interstellar medium).
The luminosity decays on a time-scale of decades, depending on the distance of

careful discrimination, these sources potentially could contaminate the

effect, the baryonic stream velocity has proven to have significant impact on
dark matter halo abundance, as well as on the gas content and morphology of
small galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the impact of stream velocity on
the formation and gas content of haloes with masses up to $10^9 M_{\odot}$, an
order of magnitude larger than previous studies. We find that the non-zero
stream velocity has a sizable impact on the number density of haloes with
masses $\lesssim$ few $\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ up to $z=10$, the final redshift
of our simulations. Furthermore, the gas stream velocity induces a suppression
of the gas fraction in haloes, which at z=10 is $\sim 10 \%$ for objects with
$M\sim10^7M_{\odot}$, as well as a flattening of the gas density profiles in
the inner regions of haloes. We further identify and study the formation, in

discretized lattice phase-space, and each time-step in the simulation

affected by Monte-Carlo sampling noise and two-body relaxation) and finite
volume (FV) direct integration schemes (expensive, accurate but diffusive). We
also present improvements to the FV scheme, using a moving mesh approach
inspired by IL, to reduce numerical diffusion and the time-step criterion.
Being a direct integration scheme like FV, IL is memory limited (memory
requirement for a full 3D problem scales as N^6, where N is the resolution per

  on Social Networks","  No man is an island, as individuals interact and influence one another daily
in our society. When social influence takes place in experiments on a
population of interconnected individuals, the treatment on a unit may affect
the outcomes of other units, a phenomenon known as interference. This thesis
develops a causal framework and inference methodology for experiments where
interference takes place on a network of influence (i.e. network interference).
In this framework, the network potential outcomes serve as the key quantity and
flexible building blocks for causal estimands that represent a variety of
primary, peer, and total treatment effects. These causal estimands are
estimated via principled Bayesian imputation of missing outcomes. The theory on
the unconfoundedness assumptions leading to simplified imputation highlights
the importance of including relevant network covariates in the potential
outcome model. Additionally, experimental designs that result in balanced
covariates and sizes across treatment exposure groups further improve the
causal estimate, especially by mitigating potential outcome model
mis-specification. The true potential outcome model is not typically known in
real-world experiments, so the best practice is to account for interference and
confounding network covariates through both balanced designs and model-based
imputation. A full factorial simulated experiment is formulated to demonstrate
this principle by comparing performance across different randomization schemes
during the design phase and estimators during the analysis phase, under varying
network topology and true potential outcome models. Overall, this thesis
asserts that interference is not just a nuisance for analysis but rather an
opportunity for quantifying and leveraging peer effects in real-world

heterogeneous data modalities relevant for an inference, prediction, or

model to represent the statistical dependencies, via a set of connected
""modules"", each relating to a specific data modality, and drawing on specific
domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the
conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty
quantification and information propagation through and across the modules.
However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update
of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when
certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to

information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation
to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we
investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11039v1,"Similar star formation rate and metallicity evolution timescales drive
  the fundamental metallicity relation","  The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) is a postulated correlation
between galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas-phase
metallicity. At its core, this relation posits that offsets from the
mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at a fixed stellar mass are correlated with
galactic SFR. In this Letter, we quantify the timescale with which galactic
SFRs and metallicities evolve using hydrodynamical simulations. We find that
Illustris and IllustrisTNG predict that galaxy offsets from the star formation
main sequence and MZR evolve over similar timescales, are often anti-correlated
in their evolution, evolve with the halo dynamical time, and produce a
pronounced FMR. In fact, for a FMR to exist, the metallicity and SFR must
evolve in an anti-correlated sense which requires that they evolve with similar
time variability. In contrast to Illustris and IllustrisTNG, we speculate that
the SFR and metallicity evolution tracks may become decoupled in galaxy
formation models dominated by globally-bursty SFR histories, which could weaken
the FMR residual correlation strength. This opens the possibility of
discriminating between bursty and non-bursty feedback models based on the
strength and persistence of the FMR -- especially at high redshift.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03507v2,On the Schrodinger-Poisson--Vlasov-Poisson correspondence,"  The Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations describe the behavior of a superfluid
Bose-Einstein condensate under self-gravity with a 3D wave function. As
$\hbar/m\to 0$, $m$ being the boson mass, the equations have been postulated to
approximate the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson equations also known as the
collisionless Boltzmann-Poisson equations. The latter describe collisionless
matter with a 6D classical distribution function. We investigate the nature of
this correspondence with a suite of numerical test problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D
along with analytic treatments when possible. We demonstrate that, while the
density field of the superfluid always shows order unity oscillations as
$\hbar/m\to 0$ due to interference and the uncertainty principle, the potential
field converges to the classical answer as $(\hbar/m)^{2}$. Thus, any dynamics
coupled to the superfluid potential is expected to recover the classical
collisionless limit as $\hbar/m\to 0$. The quantum superfluid is able to
capture rich phenomena such as multiple phase-sheets, shell-crossings, and warm
distributions. Additionally, the quantum pressure tensor acts as a regularizer
of caustics and singularities in classical solutions. This suggests the
exciting prospect of using the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations as a low-memory
method for approximating the high-dimensional evolution of the Vlasov-Poisson
equations. As a particular example we consider dark matter composed of
ultra-light axions, which in the classical limit ($\hbar/m\to 0$) is expected
to manifest itself as collisionless cold dark matter.

brightness: EXors/FUors variations are commonly associated with enhanced
accretion outbursts occurring at intermittent cadence of months/years (EXors)

extinction along their line of sight are instead classified as UXors. We aim at
investigating the long-term photometric behaviour of three sources classified
as eruptive variables. We present data from the archival plates of the Asiago
Observatory relative to the fields where the targets are located. For the sake
of completeness we have also analysed the Harvard plates of the same regions
that cover a much longer historical period, albeit at a lower sensitivity,
however we are only able to provide upper limits. A total of 273 Asiago plates
were investigated, providing a total of more than 200 magnitudes for the three

compared our data with more recently collected literature data. Our plates
analysis of V2492 Cyg provides historical upper limits that seem not to be
compatible with the level of the activity monitored during the last decade.
Therefore, recently observed accretion phenomena could be associated with the
outbursting episodes, more than repetitive obscuration. While a pure extinction
does not seem the only mechanism responsible for the ASASSN-15qi fluctuations,
it can account quite reasonably for the recent V350 Cep variations.

When working with an extra-solar planet database, it is very useful to have a
taxonomy scale (classification) such as, for example, the Harvard
classification for stars. The taxonomy has to be easily interpreted and present
the most relevant information about extra-solar planets. I propose the
following the extra-solar planet taxonomy scale with four parameters. The first
parameter concerns the mass of an extra-solar planet in the form of the units
of the mass of other known planets, where M represents the mass of Mercury, E
that of Earth, N Neptune, and J Jupiter. The second parameter is the planet's
distance from its parent star (semi-major axis) described in logarithm with
base 10. The third parameter is the mean Dyson temperature of the extra-solar
planet, for which I established four main temperature classes; F represents the
Freezing class, W the Water Class, G the Gaseous Class, and R the Roasters
Class. I devised one additional class, however: P, the Pulsar Class, which
concerns extra-solar planets orbiting pulsar stars. The fourth parameter is
eccentricity. If the attributes of the surface of the extra-solar planet are
known, we are able to establish this additional parameter where t represents a
terrestrial planet, g a gaseous planet, and i an ice planet. According to this
taxonomy scale, for example, Earth is 1E0W0t, Neptune is 1N1.5F0i, and
extra-solar planet 55 Cnc e is 9E-1.8R1. Key words: Catalogues - Extra-solar

simultaneously reconstruct inhomogeneous reionization signals tau(n) and
gravitational lensing potential phi(n). We apply our new unbiased estimators to
future CMB experiment to assess the detectability of inhomogeneous reionization

metallicities of dwarf galaxies depend only on stellar mass, the shapes of

distributions of dIrrs resemble simple, leaky box chemical evolution models,
whereas dSphs require an additional parameter, such as gas accretion, to
explain the shapes of their metallicity distributions. Furthermore, the

progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their
association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae, their exclusive location in
star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright ultraviolet
regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on
theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (NS-NS or
NS-BH). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005, provided the first
insight into their energy scale and environments, established a cosmological
origin, a mix of host galaxy types, and an absence of associated supernovae. In
this review I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host galaxy
observations, and use this information to shed light on the nature and
properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the
relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The
preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors,

  Testing a Persistent Idea","  The solar chromosphere contains thin, highly dynamic strands of plasma known
as spicules. Recently, it has been suggested that the smallest and fastest
(Type II) spicules are identical to intermittent jets observed by the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph. These jets appear to expand out along open
magnetic field lines rooted in unipolar network regions of coronal holes. In
this paper we revisit a thirty-year-old idea that spicules may be caused by
upward forces associated with Alfven waves. These forces involve the conversion
of transverse Alfven waves into compressive acoustic-like waves that steepen
into shocks. The repeated buffeting due to upward shock propagation causes
nonthermal expansion of the chromosphere and a transient levitation of the
transition region. Some older models of wave-driven spicules assumed sinusoidal
wave inputs, but the solar atmosphere is highly turbulent and stochastic. Thus,
we model this process using the output of a time-dependent simulation of
reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting mode-converted
compressive waves are strongly variable in time, with a higher transition
region occurring when the amplitudes are large and a lower transition region
when the amplitudes are small. In this picture, the transition region bobs up
and down by several Mm on timescales less than a minute. These motions produce
narrow, intermittent extensions of the chromosphere that have similar
properties as the observed jets and Type II spicules.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08060v2,Shadows of spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities,"  We compare shadows cast by Schwarzschild black holes with those produced by
two classes of naked singularities that result from gravitational collapse of
spherically symmetric matter. The latter models consist of an interior naked
singularity spacetime restricted to radii $r\leq R_b$, matched to Schwarzschild
spacetime outside the boundary radius $R_b$. While a black hole always has a
photon sphere and always casts a shadow, we find that the naked singularity
models have photon spheres only if a certain parameter $M_0$ that characterizes
these models satisfies $M_0\geq 2/3$, or equivalently, if $R_b\leq 3M$, where
$M$ is the total mass of the object. Such models do produce shadows. However,
models with $M_0<2/3$ (or $R_b>3M$) have no photon sphere and do not produce a
shadow. Instead, they produce an interesting `full-moon' image. These results
imply that the presence of a shadow does not by itself prove that a compact
object is necessarily a black hole. The object could be a naked singularity
with $M_0\geq 2/3$, and we will need other observational clues to distinguish
the two possibilities. On the other hand, the presence of a full-moon image
would certainly rule out a black hole and might suggest a naked singularity
with $M_0<2/3$. It would be worthwhile to generalize the present study, which
is restricted to spherically symmetric models, to rotating black holes and
naked singularities.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01987v2,AREPO-RT: Radiation hydrodynamics on a moving mesh,"  We introduce AREPO-RT, a novel radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) solver for the
unstructured moving-mesh code AREPO. Our method solves the moment-based
radiative transfer equations using the M1 closure relation. We achieve second
order convergence by using a slope limited linear spatial extrapolation and a
first order time prediction step to obtain the values of the primitive
variables on both sides of the cell interface. A Harten-Lax-Van Leer flux
function, suitably modified for moving meshes, is then used to solve the
Riemann problem at the interface. The implementation is fully conservative and
compatible with the individual timestepping scheme of AREPO. It incorporates
atomic Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He) thermochemistry, which is used to couple
the ultra-violet (UV) radiation field to the gas. Additionally, infrared
radiation is coupled to the gas under the assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium between the gas and the dust. We successfully apply our code to a
large number of test problems, including applications such as the expansion of
${\rm H_{II}}$ regions, radiation pressure driven outflows and the levitation
of optically thick layer of gas by trapped IR radiation. The new implementation
is suitable for studying various important astrophysical phenomena, such as the
effect of radiative feedback in driving galactic scale outflows, radiation
driven dusty winds in high redshift quasars, or simulating the reionisation
history of the Universe in a self consistent manner.

averaging over many precincts in the presence of the non-identified parameter
of the contextual effect. This may be regarded as a first attempt in this
venerable literature to limit the scope of the key form of non-identifiability
in EI. To study the operating characteristics of our model, we have amassed the
largest collection of data with known ground truth ever applied to evaluate
solutions to the EI problem. We collect and study 459 datasets from a variety
of fields including public health, political science, and sociology. The
datasets contain a total of 2,370,854 geographic units (e.g., precincts), with
an average of 5,165 geographic units per dataset. Our replication data are
publicly available via the Harvard Dataverse (Jiang et al. 2018) and may serve
as a useful resource for future researchers. For all real data sets in our

still capturing the true district level parameter in excess of 97\% of the

coordinates from estimates of the interatomic distances, which maintains the
positions of the atoms in a known rigid substructure. Given an $M \times 3$
matrix of coordinates for the rigid substructure $\mathbf X$, this problem
consists of finding the $N \times 3$ matrix $\mathbf Y$ that yields of global
minimum of the so-called STRAIN, i.e. \[ \min_{\mathbf Y} \left\|
\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{XX}^\top & \mathbf{XY}^\top \\ \mathbf{YX}^\top &
\mathbf{YY}^\top \end{bmatrix} \,-\, \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf A & \mathbf B \\
\mathbf B^\top & \mathbf C \end{bmatrix} \right\|_{\mathsf F}^2 ~, \] where
$\mathbf A = \mathbf{XX}^\top$ , and $\mathbf B, \mathbf C$ are matrices of
inner products calculated from the estimated distances.
  The vanishing of the gradient of the STRAIN is shown to be equivalent to a
system of only six nonlinear equations in six unknowns for the inertial tensor
associated with the solution Y . The entire solution space is characterized in
terms of the geometry of the intersection curves between the unit sphere and
certain variable ellipsoids. Upon deriving tight bilateral bounds on the
moments of inertia of any possible solution, we construct a search procedure
that reliably locates the global minimum. The effectiveness of this method is
demonstrated on realistic simulated and chemical test problems.

playing a key role in multiple galaxy formation processes. We present a novel
numerical framework for the dynamics and size evolution of dust grains
implemented in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO suited for cosmological
galaxy formation simulations. We employ a particle-based method for dust
subject to dynamical forces including drag and gravity. The drag force is
implemented using a second-order semi-implicit integrator and validated using
several dust-hydrodynamical test problems. Each dust particle has a grain size
distribution, describing the local abundance of grains of different sizes. The
grain size distribution is discretised with a second-order piecewise linear
method and evolves in time according to various dust physical processes,
including accretion, sputtering, shattering, and coagulation. We present a
novel scheme for stochastically forming dust during stellar evolution and new
methods for sub-cycling of dust physics time-steps. Using this model, we
simulate an isolated disc galaxy to study the impact of dust physical processes
that shape the interstellar grain size distribution. We demonstrate, for
example, how dust shattering shifts the grain size distribution to smaller
sizes resulting in a significant rise of radiation extinction from optical to
near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Our framework for simulating dust and gas
mixtures can readily be extended to account for other dynamical processes
relevant in galaxy formation, like magnetohydrodynamics, radiation pressure,
and thermo-chemical processes.

'Vakyapadiya' have been a matter of study for modern scholars, at least for
more than 50 years, since Ashok Aklujkar submitted his Ph.D. dissertation at

in many works that followed later on. While some scholars have applied
philological techniques to critically establish the text of the works of
Bhartrhari, some others have devoted themselves to exploring philosophical
insights from them. Some others have studied his works from the point of view
of modern linguistics, and psychology. Few others have tried to justify the

that the Milky Way stellar halo is dominated by metal-rich stars on highly
eccentric orbits. To shed light on the nature of this prominent halo component,
we have analysed 28 Galaxy analogues in the Auriga suite of cosmological
hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations. Some three quarters of the Auriga galaxies
contain significant components with high radial velocity anisotropy, beta >
0.6. However, only in one third of the hosts do the high-beta stars contribute
significantly to the accreted stellar halo overall, similar to what is observed
in the Milky Way. For this particular subset we reveal the origin of the
dominant stellar halo component with high metallicity, [Fe/H]~-1, and high
orbital anisotropy, beta>0.8, by tracing their stars back to the epoch of
accretion. It appears that, typically, these stars come from a single dwarf
galaxy with a stellar mass of order of 10^9-10^10 Msol that merged around 6-10
Gyr ago, causing a sharp increase in the halo mass. Our study therefore
establishes a firm link between the excess of radially anisotropic stellar
debris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient head-on collision between the young
Milky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy

variance estimator for a systematic sample using one random start. As a result,
many forest inventory analysts resort to applying variance estimators that are
design-unbiased following simple random sampling to their systematic samples
even though this typically leads to conservative estimates of error. We explore
the influence of spatial autocorrelation on variance estimation when systematic
sampling is employed using repeated sampling. We generate a sequence of 1000
synthetic populations with increasing spatial autocorrelation and repeatedly
sample from each to examine how the performance of estimators change as spatial
autocorrelation changes. We also repeatedly sample from a tree census plot in
Harvard Forest, Massachusetts and examine the performance of similar
estimators. Results indicate that applying variance estimators that are
unbiased following simple random sampling to systematic samples from
populations exhibiting stronger spatial autocorrelation tend to be more
conservative. We also find that incorporating ancillary wall-to-wall
covariates, e.g., remote sensing data, using generalized regression estimators
can reduce variance over-estimation by explaining some or all of the spatial
structure in the population.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09459v2,Fast radio burst source properties from polarization measurements,"  Recent polarization measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide new
insights on these enigmatic sources. We show that the nearly 100% linear
polarization and small variation of the polarization position angles (PAs) of
multiple bursts from the same source suggest that the radiation is produced
near the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star. As the emitted
radiation travels through the magnetosphere, the electric vector of the X-mode
wave adiabatically rotates and stays perpendicular to the local magnetic field
direction. The PA freezes at a radius where the plasma density becomes too
small to be able to turn the electric vector. At the freeze-out radius, the
electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron
star projected in the plane of the sky, independent of the radiation mechanism
or the orientation of the magnetic field in the emission region. We discuss a
number of predictions of the model. The variation of PAs from repeating FRBs
should follow the rotational period of the underlying neutron star (but the
burst occurrence may not be periodic). Measuring this period will provide
crucial support for the neutron star nature of the progenitors of FRBs. For FRB
121102, the small range of PA variation means that the magnetic inclination
angle is less than about 20 degrees and that the observer's line of sight is
outside the magnetic inclination cone. Other repeating FRBs may have a
different range of PA variation from that of FRB 121102, depending on the
magnetic inclination and the observer's viewing angle.

(AGN), is now a cornerstone of galaxy formation models. In this work, we
present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative AGN feedback using the
novel Arepo-RT. A central black hole emits radiation at a constant luminosity
and drives an outflow via radiation pressure on dust grains. Utilising an
isolated NFW halo we validate our setup in the single and multi-scattering
regimes, with the simulated shock front propagation in excellent agreement with
the expected analytic result. For a spherically symmetric NFW halo, an
examination of the simulated outflow properties generated by radiative feedback
demonstrates that they are lower than typically observed at a fixed AGN
luminosity, regardless of the collimation of the radiation. We then explore the
impact of a central disc galaxy and the assumed dust model on the outflow
properties. The contraction of the halo during the galaxy's formation and
modelling the production of dust grains results in a factor $100$ increase in
the halo's optical depth. Radiation is then able to couple momentum more
efficiently to the gas, driving a stronger shock and producing a mass-loaded
$\sim10^{3}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ outflow with a velocity of
$\sim2000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations.
However, the inclusion of dust destruction mechanisms, like thermal sputtering,
leads to the rapid destruction of dust grains within the outflow, reducing its
properties below typically observed values. We conclude that radiative AGN
feedback can drive outflows, but a thorough numerical and physical treatment is
required to assess its true impact.

  As potentially powerful as cloud-based experimentation may be in the
abstract, it has not yet become a standard option for researchers in many
academic disciplines. The prospect of actually conducting massive computational
experiments in today's cloud systems confronts the potential user with daunting
challenges. Leading considerations include: (i) the seeming complexity of
today's cloud computing interface, (ii) the difficulty of executing an
overwhelmingly large number of jobs, and (iii) the difficulty of monitoring and
combining a massive collection of separate results. Starting a massive
experiment `bare-handed' seems therefore highly problematic and prone to rapid
`researcher burn out'.
  New software stacks are emerging that render massive cloud experiments
relatively painless. Such stacks simplify experimentation by systematizing
experiment definition, automating distribution and management of tasks, and
allowing easy harvesting of results and documentation. In this article, we
discuss several painless computing stacks that abstract away the difficulties
of massive experimentation, thereby allowing a proliferation of ambitious
experiments for scientific discovery.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03145v2,Observations of red giants with suspected massive companions,"  Motivated by the existence of binary systems where a stellar-mass black hole
is bound to a normal star, we selected four red giants with large radial
velocity (RV) variation from the survey of SIM grid stars and monitored their
RVs for several months. None turned out to contain a massive companion above
2.5 solar masses. The red giant TYC 9299-1080-1 with a large RV and a large
proper motion is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 81 days.
It is an extreme halo object moving at 350 km s$^{-1}$ almost directly toward
the Galactic center. HD 206092 is a double-lined binary with a short period of
4.37 days. It belongs to the rare class of active RS CVn-type binaries with
evolved primary components, apparently undergoing mass transfer. The X-ray
luminosity of HD 206092 is about twice as high as the most luminous coronal
X-ray emitters observed by ROSAT, including II Peg and the prototype star RS
CVn. HD~318347 has a variable double-peaked emission-line spectrum (not a
giant), while HD~324668 has a constant RV. Despite the overall good quality of
the SIM survey data confirmed by a comparison with Gaia DR2 mean radial
velocities, the few large RV variations are explained, mostly, by erroneous
data. We discuss the significance of the non-detection of massive companions in
the SIM grid sample and the associated work.

the classification and construction of 3D bosonic SPT phases with space-group

dwarf (WD) pulsar. Previously reported photometric datasets only provide
coverage back to 2005, but we extend the observational baseline for AR Sco back
to the beginning of the 20th century by analyzing observations from the Digital
Access to a Sky Century at Harvard project (DASCH). We find that the orbital
waveform of AR Sco remained constant across that baseline with no significant
deviations from its average brightness. This result strongly suggests that the
absence of accretion in modern observations is a long-term feature of AR Sco.
Additionally, the DASCH light curve provides an opportunity to test an earlier
prediction that an obliquity of the WD would result in a precessional period
observable in long-term studies of the orbital light curve. The DASCH
observations do not indicate the presence of such a period, and we show that
previous, inconclusive tests of this hypothesis were insensitive to the
existence of a precessional period. Furthermore, the long DASCH baseline
enables us to constrain the rate of change of the orbital frequency to
$\dot{\nu} \lesssim 3.8\times10^{-20}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, constraining the efficacy
of magnetic braking as a mechanism of angular-momentum loss in this system.
Finally, we discuss how the combination of the orbital waveform's stability,
high amplitude, and short period should make it possible to identify additional

interstellar isotopic abundances, significantly underestimates the integrated

a factor of 2-6 larger than previous gas mass estimates using C18O. We find
that C18O emission is optically thick within the CO snow line, while the 13C17O

information such as individuals' shopping transactions, personal contacts, and
medical records. An increasingly important line of work therefore has sought to
train neural networks subject to privacy constraints that are specified by
differential privacy or its divergence-based relaxations. These privacy
definitions, however, have weaknesses in handling certain important primitives
(composition and subsampling), thereby giving loose or complicated privacy
analyses of training neural networks. In this paper, we consider a recently
proposed privacy definition termed \textit{$f$-differential privacy} [18] for a
refined privacy analysis of training neural networks. Leveraging the appealing
properties of $f$-differential privacy in handling composition and subsampling,
this paper derives analytically tractable expressions for the privacy
guarantees of both stochastic gradient descent and Adam used in training deep
neural networks, without the need of developing sophisticated techniques as [3]
did. Our results demonstrate that the $f$-differential privacy framework allows
for a new privacy analysis that improves on the prior analysis~[3], which in
turn suggests tuning certain parameters of neural networks for a better
prediction accuracy without violating the privacy budget. These theoretically
derived improvements are confirmed by our experiments in a range of tasks in
image classification, text classification, and recommender systems. Python code
to calculate the privacy cost for these experiments is publicly available in

treated using live simulation particles, each of which represent a population
of grains that are coupled to hydrodynamic motion through a drag force. We
introduce methods to calculate radiation pressure on and photon absorption by
dust grains. By including a direct treatment of dust, we are able to calculate

unstructured mesh for radiation is validated using several test problems with
known analytic solutions, including dust driven via spherically-symmetric flux
from a constant luminosity source and photon absorption from radiation incident
on a thin layer of dust. Our methods are compatible with the multifrequency
scheme in AREPO-RT, which treats UV and optical photons as single-scattered and
IR photons as multi-scattered. At IR wavelengths, we model heating of and
thermal emission from dust. Dust and gas are not assumed to be in local
thermodynamic equilibrium but transfer energy through collisional exchange. We
estimate dust temperatures by balancing these dust-radiation and dust-gas
energy exchange rates. This framework for coupling dust and radiation can be

properties in dark matter haloes, along with data-driven predictions for the
atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) gas evolution in galaxies, to derive
empirical relationships between the build-up of galactic components and their
evolution over cosmic time. At high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), the frameworks
imply that galaxies acquire their cold gas (both atomic and molecular) mostly
by accretion, with the fraction of cold gas reaching about 20% of the cosmic
baryon fraction. We infer a strong dependence of the star formation rate on the
H$_2$ mass, suggesting a near-universal depletion timescale of 0.1-1 Gyr in
Milky Way sized haloes (of masses $10^{12} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$). There is
also evidence for a near-universality of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation across
redshifts, with very little dependence on stellar mass, if a constant
conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) of CO luminosity to molecular gas mass is
assumed. Combining the atomic and molecular gas observations with the stellar
build-up illustrates that galactic mass assembly in Milky-Way sized haloes
proceeds from smooth accretion at high redshifts, towards becoming
merger-dominated at late times ($z \lesssim 0.6$). Our results can be used to
constrain numerical simulations of the dominant growth and accretion processes

ecosystem and are the main mechanism through which low-mass galaxies regulate
their star formation. These winds are generally observed to be multi-phase with
detections of entrained neutral and molecular gas. They are also thought to
enrich the circum-galactic medium around galaxies with metals and dust. This
ejected dust encodes information about the integrated star formation and
outflow history of the galaxy. It is therefore, important to understand how
much dust is entrained and driven out of the disc by galactic winds. Here we
demonstrate that stellar feedback is efficient in driving dust-enriched winds
and eject enough material to account for the amount of extraplanar dust
observed in nearby galaxies. The amount of dust in the wind depends on the
sites from where they are launched, with dustier galaxies launching more dust
enriched outflows. Moreover, the outflowing cold-dense gas is significantly
more dust-enriched than the volume filling hot tenuous material, naturally
reproducing the complex multiphase structure of the outflowing wind observed in
nearby galaxies. These results provide an important new insight into the
dynamics, structure, and composition of galactic winds and their role in
determining the dust content of the extragalactic gas in galaxies.

  Emission","  Recent observations of nearby Compton thick (CT) active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) with Chandra have resolved hard (>3 keV) X-ray emission extending out
from the central supermassive black hole to kiloparsec scales, challenging the
long-held belief that the characteristic hard X-ray continuum and fluorescent
Fe K lines originate in the inner ~parsec due to the excitation of obscuring
material. In this paper we present the results of the most recent Chandra
ACIS-S observations of NGC 7212, a CT AGN in a compact group of interacting
galaxies, with a total effective exposure of ~150 ks. We find ~20 percent of
the observed emission is found outside of the central ~kiloparsec, with ~17
percent associated with the soft X-rays, and ~3 percent with hard X-ray
continuum and Fe K line. This emission is extended both along the ionization
cone and in the cross-cone direction up to ~3.8 kpc scales. The spectrum of NGC
7212 is best represented by a mixture of thermal and photoionization models
that indicate the presence of complex gas interactions. These observations are
consistent with what is observed in other CT AGN (e.g., ESO 428-G014, NGC
1068), providing further evidence that this may be a common phenomenon.
High-resolution observations of extended CT AGN provide an especially valuable
environment for understanding how AGN feedback impacts host galaxies on
galactic scales.

  Case Fatality Rate","  The relative case fatality rates (CFRs) between groups and countries are key
measures of relative risk that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical
resource allocation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the middle of an
active outbreak when surveillance data is the primary source of information,
estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time
series of deaths, cases, and recoveries. These include time- and severity-
dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes.
In the context of COVID-19 CFR estimation, we survey such biases and their
potential significance. Further, we analyze theoretically the effect of certain
biases, like preferential reporting of fatal cases, on naive estimators of CFR.
We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that
accounts for time lag and imperfect reporting of deaths and recoveries. We show
that collection of randomized data by testing the contacts of infectious
individuals regardless of the presence of symptoms would mitigate bias by
limiting the covariance between diagnosis and death. Our analysis is
supplemented by theoretical and numerical results and a simple and fast

the Standard Model (SM). An interesting target are light relics, new degrees of
freedom which decoupled from the SM while relativistic. Nearly massless relics
contribute to the radiation energy budget, and are commonly searched through
variations in the effective number $N_{\rm eff}$ of neutrino species.
Additionally, relics with masses on the eV scale (meV-10 eV) become
non-relativistic before today, and thus behave as matter instead of radiation.
This leaves an imprint in the clustering of the large-scale structure of the
universe, as light relics have important streaming motions, mirroring the case
of massive neutrinos. Here we forecast how well current and upcoming
cosmological surveys can probe light massive relics (LiMRs). We consider
minimal extensions to the SM by both fermionic and bosonic relic degrees of
freedom. By combining current and upcoming cosmic-microwave-background and
large-scale-structure surveys, we forecast the significance at which each LiMR,
with different masses and temperatures, can be detected. We find that a very
large coverage of parameter space will be attainable by upcoming experiments,
opening the possibility of exploring uncharted territory for new physics beyond
the SM.

neutrinos consists of leveraging cosmological datasets, such as the cosmic
microwave background and surveys of the large-scale structure of the universe.
In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the neutrino mass, however, many
effects ought to be included. Here we forecast, via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
likelihood analysis, whether measurements by two galaxy surveys: DESI and {\it
Euclid}, when added to the CMB-S4 experiment, are sensitive to two effects that
can alter neutrino-mass measurements. The first is the slight difference in the
suppression of matter fluctuations that each neutrino-mass hierarchy generates,
at fixed total mass. The second is the growth-induced scale-dependent bias
(GISDB) of haloes produced by massive neutrinos. We find that near-future
surveys can distinguish hierarchies with the same total mass only at the
$1\sigma$ level; thus, while these are poised to deliver a measurement of the
sum of neutrino masses, they cannot significantly discern the mass of each
individual neutrino in the foreseeable future. We further find that neglecting
the GISDB induces up to a $1\sigma$ overestimation of the total neutrino mass,
and we show how to absorb this effect via a redshift-dependent parametrization
of the scale-independent bias.

temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) accurately and precisely to
broad-band stellar photometry. This model must, and does, simultaneously
constrain the passband-specific dust reddening vector in the Milky Way. The
model uses a neural network to learn the (de-reddened) absolute magnitude in
one band and colors across many bands, given stellar parameters from
spectroscopic surveys and parallax constraints from Gaia. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach, we train our model on a dataset with
spectroscopic labels from LAMOST, APOGEE and GALAH, Gaia parallaxes, and
optical and near-infrared photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS 1, 2MASS and WISE.
Testing the model on these datasets leads to an excellent fit and a precise --
and by construction accurate -- prediction of the color-magnitude diagrams in
many bands. This flexible approach rigorously links spectroscopic and
photometric surveys, and also results in an improved, temperature-dependent
reddening vector. As such, it provides a simple and accurate method for
predicting photometry in stellar evolutionary models. Our model will form a
basis to infer stellar properties, distances and dust extinction from
photometric data, which should be of great use in 3D mapping of the Milky Way.

learning from the synthetic data generated by the two models. The best result
for all of the 7 subjects were networks that had been exposed to synthetic

$I_{q,c}(V,\Phi/\Phi_0)$ on the quartet line is obtained at sufficiently large
$V$ if an avoided crossing appears at $(V,\Phi/\Phi_0=0)$ but not at $(V,1/2)$.
The inversion originates from the reduction in $I_{q,c}$ produced by the
dynamical quantum mechanical superposition of the two Andreev bound state
manifolds. In addition, $\pi$-$0$ and $0$-$\pi$ cross-overs emerge in the
current-phase relations as $V$ is further increased. This $\pi$-shift is an
effect of the nonequilibrium Floquet populations produced by voltage biasing.
Numerical calculations show that the inversions are robust against strong

that the recent Harvard group experimental observation of an inversion at

emission in the average COSMOS spectrum (Gaussian width $\sigma=0.27\pm0.05$

we measure the average black hole spin parameter $a=0.62~\substack{+0.07 \\

resolution of the COSMOS Legacy field also provide a unique environment to
investigate the average SMBH spin as a function of other observables (e.g.,

1 sources have broader Fe K$\alpha$ line emission than Type 2 sources. X-ray
unobscured and obscured sources, as defined by their column densities, have
widths that are consistent with the optically defined unobscured and obscured

we obtained and report here velocity measurements for 33 rapidly-rotating B, A,

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10982v1,An Introduction to Proximal Causal Learning,"  A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that
one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within
covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values.
Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is
often warranted because it hinges on investigators' ability to accurately
measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding.
Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with
certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that
covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding
mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims
made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions. Causal learning from
proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal
causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as
imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn
about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured
covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are
given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal
g-computation algorithm for estimation. These may be viewed as generalizations
of Robins' foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account
explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and
time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal
g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.

lensed quasar 0957+561. The model is a generalization of the singular
isothermal sphere and includes a core radius, $r_c$, and a power-law index,
$\eta$, defined such that mass increases as $r^\eta$ at large radius. We
approximate the galaxy cluster surrounding the lensing galaxy with a quadratic
potential described by its convergence $\kappa$ and shear $\gamma$. We fit the
model to a recent high resolution VLBI map of the two images of 0957+561. We
obtain a tight constraint on the radial index, $1.07 < \eta <1.18$, which means
that the lens galaxy is nearly isothermal with increasing mass-to-light ratio
out to $15 h^{-1}$ kpc. We also obtain an upper limit on the core radius, $r_c
< 330 h^{-1}$ pc. We use the model to calculate the Hubble constant $H_0$ as a
function of the time delay $\Delta\tau_{BA}$ between the two images: $H_0 =
\left({ 82.5^{+5.9} _{-3.0} }\right) (1 - \kappa) \left({ \Delta\tau_{BA}/1.1

will provide an upper bound on $H_0$ since $\kappa$ cannot be negative. In
addition, the model degeneracy due to $\kappa$ can be eliminated if the
one-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the lensing galaxy is measured.
We then have $H_0 = \left({ 82.5^{+8.7} _{-5.6} }\right) (\sigma / 322\,{\rm

We compare our luminosity function to that from other redshift surveys; in
particular our normalization is consistent with that of the Stromlo-APM survey,
and is therefore a factor of two below that implied by the $b_J \approx 20$
bright galaxy counts. Our normalization thus indicates that much more evolution
is needed to match the faint galaxy count data, compared to minimal evolution
models which normalize at $b_J \approx 20$. Also, we show that our faint-end
slope $\alpha = -0.7$, though ``shallower'' than typical previous values
$\alpha = -1$, results primarily from fitting the detailed shape of the LCRS
luminosity function, rather than from any absence of intrinsically faint
galaxies from our survey. Finally, using [OII] 3727 equivalent width
$W_{\lambda} = 5$~\AA \ as the dividing line, we find significant differences

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9603033v1,A Line of Sight Approach to Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies,"  We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon
past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a
time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The
geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the
particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of
photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a
small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between
the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More
importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared
to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on
the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a
slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small
number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than
the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed
in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a
much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of
magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically
requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should
be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters
from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible
with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method
can be obtained from the authors.

images, and gas temperatures to study substructure, masses, luminosity
functions, and mass-to-light ratios in A2626 and A2440. The symmetric X-ray
emission from A2626 suggests a relaxed, single-component system; however, 159
redshifts reveals a complex, three component cluster at cz~17,500km/s. One
components is a typical X-ray bright cluster, a second has a cluster-like
galaxy population with lower central galaxy and gas density, and the third is a
background structure with field galaxy composition. A comparison of the
magnitude distributions within the two subclusters suggests that A2626 is a
merger in progress. Virial masses and a composite luminosity function for a
region with projected radius r=1.5h^{-1}Mpc yield a mass to light ratio
M/L_R~610h. Analysis of the X-ray emission from the primary component yields a
gas mass fraction of 2.2h^{-3/2}% and a baryon fraction of 3.4%. A radial
infall model implies that the virial mass may be an underestimate. In A2440,
deep CCD $R$ band photometry indicates a striking correspondence between the
galaxy and gas distributions. The galaxy distribution has three main
components, each associated with a giant elliptical galaxy. The two larger
peaks in the galaxy distribution coincide with the primary peaks in the X-ray
emission, and the third is associated with a significant X-ray surface
brightness enhancement. We use this galaxy-gas correspondence and 48 redshifts
to argue that the subclusters are bound within a single system, and that the
two primary components are beginning to merge. The composite luminosity
function and estimates of the subcluster virial masses indicate a mass-to-light
ratio from 660h to 880h.

  the low mass x-ray binary 4U 0614+091","  We have detected quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) near 1 kHz from the low
mass X-ray binary 4U 0614+091 in observations with XTE. The observations span
several months and sample the source over a large range of X-ray luminosity. In
every interval QPOs are present above 400 Hz with fractional RMS amplitudes
from 3 to 12%. At high count rates, two high frequency QPOs are detected
simultaneously. The difference of their frequency centroids is consistent with
323 Hz in all observations. During one interval a third signal is detected at
328 +/- 2 Hz. This suggests the system has a stable `clock' which is most
likely the neutron star with spin period 3.1 msec. Thus, our observations and
those of another neutron star system by Strohmayer et al. (1996) provide the
first evidence for millisecond pulsars within low-mass X-ray binary systems and
reveal the `missing-link' between millisecond radiopulsars and the late stages
of binary evolution in low mass X-ray binaries (Alpar et al. 1982). We suggest
that the kinematics of the magnetospheric beat-frequency model (Alpar and
Shaham 1985) applies to these QPOs. In this interpretation the high frequency
signal is associated with the Keplerian frequency of the inner accretion disk
and the lower frequency `beat' signal arises from the differential rotation
frequency of the inner disk and the spinning neutron star. Assuming the high
frequency QPO is a Keplerian orbital frequency for the accretion disk, we find
a maximum mass of 1.9 solar masses and a maximum radius of 17 km for the
neutron star.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9704290v1,The First Stars and Quasars in the Universe,"  The transition between the nearly smooth initial state of the Universe and
its clumpy state today occurred during the epoch when the first stars and
low-luminosity quasars formed. For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, the radiation
produced by the first baryonic objects is expected to ionize the Universe at
z=10-20 and consequently suppress by 10% the amplitude of microwave
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees. Future microwave anisotropy
satellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of
metals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the
metallicity, ~1% solar, found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z<5. The
Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to image directly the
``first light'' from these stars. With its nJy sensitivity, NGST is expected to
detect >10^3 star clusters per square arcminute at z>10. The brightest sources,
however, might be early quasars. The infrared flux from an Eddington
luminosity, 10^6 solar mass, black hole at z=10 is 10 nJy at 1 micron, easily
detectable with NGST. The time it takes a black hole with a radiative
efficiency of 10% to double its mass amounts to more than a tenth of the Hubble
time at z=10, and so a fair fraction of all systems which harbor a central
black hole at this redshift would appear active. The redshift of all sources
can be determined from the Lyman-limit break in their spectrum, which overlaps
with the NGST wavelength regime, 1-3.5 micron, for 10<z<35. Absorption spectra
of the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the
reionization history of the Universe. The intergalactic medium might show a
significant opacity to infrared sources at z>10 due to dust produced by the
first supernovae.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9804287v1,Stellar Activity in Coeval Open Clusters: Praesepe and The Hyades,"  Randich and Schmitt [1995, A&A 298, 115] found that the coronal activity of
solar-type and low mass stars in Praesepe is significantly lower than that of
stars in the Hyades cluster. We have carried out several tests in order to find
a possible explanation for this result. We have measured radial velocities of
two groups of Praesepe stars (a dF-dK sample and a dM sample) and have measured
H$\alpha$ as a chromospheric activity index for the dM sample. We conclude that
the Praesepe catalog used in the X-ray analysis does not contain a significant
number of non-members. The comparison of the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths for
the M dwarfs in Praesepe with those in the Hyades indicates that, at least for
stars in this mass range, the Praesepe stars are as active or more active than
their Hyades counterparts. We have also analyzed a few ROSAT PSPC pointings of
Praesepe in order to obtain a new and independent estimate of the X-ray
luminosities and upper limits for a small sample of Praesepe members concluding
that the small differences between the old and new upper limits are not large
enough to explain the dichotomy in the X-ray properties of Praesepe and the
Hyades. Therefore, our examination of the available data does not provide a
clear reason to explain why the X-ray luminosity functions of the two clusters
are different. Part of the explanation could be found in the binaries.
Speculatively, these clusters could have different orbital period
distributions, with more short period binaries among the Hyades, which would
show larger coronal activity.

globular cluster NGC 6397. We confirm the presence of a 4th cataclysmic
variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al.
(1998) to present evidence that CVs 1--4 all have faint disks and probably low
accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the
published spectra of Grindlay et al. (1995) we present new evidence that CVs
1--3 may be DQ Her systems, and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or
another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae
in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a
member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do
not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as ``non-flickerers'' (NFs).
Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the
cluster center. Using stellar atmosphere models we have determined log g =
6.25, and T_eff = 17,500 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the
luminosity of the NF we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium
WD having a mass of ~0.25 solar masses and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr

Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a

of this survey is to determine the size, flux, and morphology of the mid-IR

shells of proto-planetary nebulae. We imaged these proto-planetary nebulae with
narrow-band filters ($\Delta\lambda / \lambda \sim 10%$) at wavelengths of
notable dust features. With our typical angular resolution of 1\arcsec, we
resolve 17 sources, find 48 objects unresolved, and do not detect 1 source. For
several sources, we checked optical and infrared associations and positions of
the sources. In table format, we list the size and flux measurements for all
the detected objects and show figures of all the resolved sources. Images for
all the detected objects are available on line in FITS format from the

stars, young planetary nebulae, a supergiant, and a luminous blue variable. We
find that dust shells which are cooler ($\rm T \sim 150$ K) and brighter in the
infrared are more easily resolved. Eleven of the seventeen resolved sources are
extended and fall into one of two types of mid-IR morphological classes:
core/elliptical or toroidal. Core/elliptical structures show unresolved cores
with lower surface brightness elliptical nebulae. Toroidal structures show
limb-brightened peaks suggesting equatorial density enhancements. We argue that
core/ellipticals have denser dust shells than toroidals.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9902332v2,Topology from the Simulated Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"  We measure the topology (genus curve) of the galaxy distribution in a mock
redshift catalog designed to resemble the upcoming Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). The catalog, drawn from a large N-body simulation of a Lambda-CDM cos-
mological model, mimics the anticipated spectroscopic selection procedures of
the SDSS in some detail. Sky maps, redshift slices, and 3-D contour maps of the
mock survey reveal a rich and complex structure, including networks of voids
and superclusters that resemble the patterns seen in the CfA redshift survey
and the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). The 3-D genus curve can be
measured from the simulated catalog with superb precision; this curve has the
general shape predicted for Gaussian, random phase initial conditions, but the
error bars are small enough to demonstrate with high significance the subtle
departures from this shape caused by non-linear gravitational evolution. These
distortions have the form predicted by Matsubara's (1994) perturbative anal-
ysis, but they are much smaller in amplitude. We also measure the 3-D genus
curve of the radial peculiar velocity field measured by applying distance-
indicator relations (with realistic errors) to the mock catalog. This genus
curve is consistent with the Gaussian random phase prediction, though it is of
relatively low precision because of the large smoothing length required to
overcome noise in the measured velocity field. Finally, we measure the 2-D
topology in redshift slices, similar to early slices from the SDSS and to
slices already observed in the LCRS. The genus curves of these slices are
consistent with the observed genus curves of the LCRS, providing further
evidence in favor of the inflationary CDM model with Omega_M~0.4. The catalog

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905052v2,Hard X-ray emission from elliptical galaxies,"  We report the detection of hard X-ray emission components in the spectra of
six nearby, giant elliptical galaxies observed with the ASCA satellite. The
systems studied, which exhibit strong dynamical evidence for supermassive black
holes in their nuclei, are M87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696 (the dominant galaxies of
the Virgo, Fornax and Centaurus clusters, respectively) and NGC 4472, 4636 and
4649 (three further giant ellipticals in the Virgo cluster). The ASCA data for
all six sources provide clear evidence for hard emission components, which can
be parameterized by power-law models with photon indices in the range \Gamma =
0.6-1.5 (mean value 1.2) and intrinsic 1-10 keV luminosities of 2 \times
10^{40} - 2 \times 10^{42} erg/s. Our results imply the identification of a new
class of accreting X-ray source, with X-ray spectra significantly harder than
those of binary X-ray sources, Seyfert nuclei or low luminosity AGN, and
bolometric luminosities relatively dominated by their X-ray emission. We
discuss various possible origins for the hard X-ray emission and argue that it
is most likely to be due to accretion onto the central supermassive black
holes, via low-radiative efficiency accretion coupled with strong outflows. In
the case of M87, our detected power-law flux is in good agreement with a
previously-reported measurement from ROSAT High Resolution Imager observations,
which were able to resolve the jet from the nuclear X-ray emission components.
We confirm previous results showing that the use of multiphase models in the
analysis of the ASCA data leads to determinations of approximately solar
emission-weighted metallicities for the X-ray gas in the galaxies. We also
present results on the individual element abundances in NGC 4636.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905053v1,Low radiative efficiency accretion in the nuclei of elliptical galaxies,"  The discovery of hard, power-law X-ray emission from a sample of six nearby
elliptical galaxies, including the dominant galaxies of the Virgo,Fornax and
Centaurus clusters (M87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696, respectively), and NGC 4472,
4636 and 4649 in the Virgo cluster, has important implications for the study of
quiescent supermassive black holes. We describe how the broad band spectral
energy distributions of these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous
halos at rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by
low-radiative efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of the
mass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. The
observed suppression of the synchrotron component in the radio band and the
systematically hard X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal
bremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflow
is a natural consequence of systems accreting at low-radiative efficiencies. We
briefly discuss an alternative model for the X-ray emission, namely that it is
due to nonthermal synchrotron-self Compton processes in the accretion flow, or
wind. This appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. Emission from a
collimated jet viewed off axis should be distinguishable from the
bremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We argue
that the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral and
elliptical galaxies arises from the different manner in which interstellar gas
is fed into the nuclei. In ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowly
cooling) ISM is likely to be highly magnetized and with low specific angular
momentum, both of which favor low-radiative efficiency accretion solutions and
possibly the formation of the observed jets.

  The purpose of the present work is to test if idealized turbulent flows,
without self-gravity, stellar radiation, stellar outflows, or any other effect
of star formation, are inconsistent or not with statistical properties of star
forming molecular clouds.
  We present several statistical results that demonstrate remarkable similarity
between real data and the synthetic cloud. Statistical properties of molecular
clouds like Perseus are appropriately described by random super-sonic and
super-Alfvenic MHD flows. Although the description of gravity and stellar
radiation are essential to understand the formation of single protostars and
the effects of star formation in the cloud dynamics, the overall description of
the cloud and of the initial conditions for star formation can apparently be
provided on intermediate scales without accounting for gravity, stellar
radiation, and a detailed modeling of stellar outflows.

three were in a low state (LS) whereas KS1731-260 was in a high state. The LS
sources have very similar power spectra, displaying high frequency noise up to
\~200 Hz. For KS1731-260, its power spectrum is dominated by noise at
frequencies below 20 Hz. In addition a quasi-periodic oscillation at 1200 Hz is
detected. The 1-200 keV LS spectra are all consistent with resulting from
thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature (kTe) around 25-30 keV. For
KS1731-260, the spectrum is also dominated by Comptonization, but with kTe
around 3 keV and no significant hard X-ray emission. With the exception of
GS1826-238, there is an underlying soft component. For all sources, we have
detected an iron line at 6.4 keV. A reflection component is present in the

of main energy release, where hard X-rays are produced would be an optically
thin boundary layer merged with an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF).
The soft component observed probably represents the unscattered emission from
the accretion disk of variable inner radius. When the accretion rate increases,
the inner disk radius shrinks, the strength of the reflected component and
associated iron line increase, and the Comptonization region cools off in
response to an increased cooling flux from the accretion disk and from the
reprocessed/reflected component. Finally, in the light of these observations,
we discuss extensively the various criteria recently proposed to distinguish

  Prompt Emission from Gamma-Ray Burst Shocks","  Abridged.-- We demonstrate that the radiation emitted by ultrarelativistic
electrons in highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields is different from
synchrotron radiation if the electron's transverse deflections in these fields
are much smaller than the beaming angle. A quantitative analytical theory of
this radiation, which we refer to as jitter radiation, is developed. It is
shown that the emergent spectrum is determined by statistical properties of the
magnetic field. As an example,we then use the model of a magnetic field in
internal shocks of GRBs. The spectral power distribution of radiation produced
by the power-law electrons is well described by a sharply broken power-law with
indices 1 and -(p-1)/2 and the jitter break frequency is independent of the
field strength but depends on the electron density in the ejecta. Since
large-scale fields may also be present in the ejecta, we construct a
two-component, jitter+synchrotron spectral model of the prompt $\gamma$-ray
emission. Quite surprisingly, this model seems to be readily capable of
explaining several properties of time-resolved spectra of some GRBs, such as
(i) the violation of the constraint on the low-energy spectral index called the
synchrotron ``line of death'', (ii) the sharp spectral break at the peak
frequency, inconsistent with the broad synchrotron bump, (iii) the evidence for
two spectral sub-components, and (iv) possible existence of emission features
called ``GRB lines''. We believe these facts strongly support both the
existence of small-scale magnetic fields and the proposed radiation mechanism
from GRB shocks. As an example, we use the composite model to analyze GRB

  J1550-564","  We report on the X-ray spectral behavior of the exceptionally bright X-ray
nova XTE J1550-564 during its 1998-99 outburst. Our study is based on 209
pointed observations using the PCA and HEXTE instruments onboard the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer spanning 250 days and covering the entire double-peaked
eruption that occurred from 1998 September until 1999 May. The spectra are fit
to a model including multicolor blackbody disk and power-law components. The
source is observed in the very high and high/soft outburst states of black hole
X-ray novae. During the very high state, when the power-law component dominated
the spectrum, the inner disk radius is observed to vary by more than an order
of magnitude; the radius decreased by a factor of 16 in one day during a 6.8
Crab flare. If the larger of these observed radii is taken to be the last
stable orbit, then the smaller observed radius would imply that the inner edge
of the disk is inside the event horizon! However, we conclude that the apparent
variations of the inner disk radius observed during periods of increased
power-law emission are probably caused by the failure of the multicolor
disk/power-law model; the actual physical radius of the inner disk may remain
fairly constant. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the observed
inner disk radius remains approximately constant over 120 days in the high
state, when the power-law component is weak, even though the disk flux and
total flux vary by an order of magnitude. The mass of the black hole inferred
by equating the approximately constant inner disk radius observed in the
high/soft state with the last stable orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole is
M_BH = 7.4 M_sun (D/6 kpc) (cos i)^{-1/2}.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0007064v2,Self-Similar Hot Accretion Flow onto a Neutron Star,"  We consider hot, two-temperature, viscous accretion onto a rotating,
unmagnetized neutron star. We assume Coulomb coupling betweenthe protons and
electrons, and free-free cooling from the electrons. We show that the accretion
flow has an extended settling region which can be described by means of two
analytical self-similar solutions: a two-temperature solution which is valid in
an inner zone, r<10^{2.5}, where r is the radius in Schwarzchild units; and a
one-temperature solution which is valid in an outer zone, r>10^{2.5}. In both
zones the density varies as \rho ~ r^{-2} and the angular velocity as \Omega ~
r^{-3/2}. We solve the flow equations numerically and confirm that the
analytical solutions are accurate. The settling flow radiates the energy
dissipated by viscosity; so it is not advection-dominated. Except for the
radial velocity, all other gas properties - density, angular velocity,
temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux - are independent of the mass
accretion rate; these quantities do depend sensitively on the spin of the
neutron star. The angular momentum flux is outward under most conditions;
therefore, the central star is nearly always spun-down. The luminosity of the
settling zone arises from the rotational energy that is released as the star is
braked by viscosity, and the contribution from gravity is small; hence the
radiative efficiency can be arbitrarily large at low $\mdot$. For reasonable
values of the gas adiabatic index, the Bernoulli parameter is negative;
therefore, a strong outflow or wind is not expected. The flow is convectively
stable, but may be thermally unstable. The described solution is not
advection-dominated; however, when the spin of the star is small enough, it
transforms smoothly to an advection-dominated branch of solution.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102003v2,"Resolving the Image of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows with Gravitational
  Microlensing","  Microlensing of a gamma-ray burst afterglow by an intervening star can be
used to infer the radial structure of the afterglow image. Near the peak of the
microlensing event, the outer edge of the image is more highly magnified than
its central region, whereas the situation is reversed at later times due to the
rapid radial expansion of the image on the sky. Thus, the microlensed afterglow
light curve can be inverted to recover the self-similar radial intensity
profile of the afterglow image. We calculate the expected errors in the
recovered intensity profile as a function of the number of resolution elements,
under the assumption that the afterglow and microlensing event parameters are
known. For a point-mass lens and uniform source, we derive a simple scaling
relation between these parameters and the resultant errors. The afterglow need
not be monitored for its entire duration; rather, observations from the peak
magnification time t_p of the microlensing event until 7 t_p are sufficient to
resolve the majority of the image. Thus, microlensing events can be alerted by
relatively infrequent observations of afterglows and then monitored
intensively, without significant loss of information about the afterglow
intensity profile. The relative intensity profile of about 1% of all afterglows
can be measured with 10 resolution elements to an accuracy of 1% in the optical
and 10% in the infrared, using 4m-class telescopes. Weak microlensing events
with large impact parameters are more common; we estimate that for about 10% of
afterglows the image profile may be inverted to a fractional accuracy 20%
through frequent optical observations. We also calculate the effects of
external shear due to the host galaxy or a binary companion, and contamination
by background light from the host galaxy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105372v2,Constraints on Thermal Emission Models of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars,"  Thermal emission from the surface of an ultramagnetic neutron star is
believed to contribute significantly to the soft X-ray flux of the Anomalous
X-ray Pulsars. We compare the detailed predictions of models of the surface
emission from a magnetar to the observed properties of AXPs. In particular, we
focus on the combination of their luminosities and energy-dependent pulsed
fractions. We use the results of recent calculations for strongly magnetized
atmospheres to obtain the angle- and energy-dependence of the surface emission.
We include in our calculations the effects of general relativistic photon
transport and interstellar extinction. We find that the combination of the
large pulsed fractions and the high luminosities of AXPs cannot be accounted
for by surface emission from a magnetar with two antipodal hot regions or a
temperature distribution characteristic of a magnetic dipole. This result is
robust for reasonable neutron star radii, for the range of magnetic field
strengths inferred from the observed spin down rates, and for surface
temperatures consistent with the spectral properties of AXPs. Models with a
single hot emitting region can reproduce the observations, provided that the
distance to one of the sources is ~30% less than the current best estimate, and
allowing for systematic uncertainties in the spectral fit of a second source.
Finally, the thermal emission models with antipodal emission geometry predict a
characteristic strong increase of the pulsed fraction with photon energy, which
is apparently inconsistent with the current data. The energy-dependence of the
pulsed fraction in the models with one hot region shows a wider range of
behavior and can be consistent with the existing data. Upcoming high-resolution
observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton will provide a conclusive test.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105508v1,Characterizing the QPO Behavior of the X-ray Nova XTE J1550--564,"  For all 209 RXTE observations of the X-ray nova XTE J1550-564 during its
major outburst of 1998-1999, we have analyzed the X-ray power spectra, phase
lags, and coherence functions. The phase lags and coherence measures are used
to distinguish three types of low-frequency QPOs (one more than those reported
by Wijnands, Homan, & van der Klis 1999). For the most common type, the phase
lag is correlated with both the QPO frequency and the amplitude. The physical
significance of the QPO types is evident in the relationships between QPO
properties and the apparent temperature and flux from the accretion disk. There
is also a clear pattern in how the QPO types relate to the presence of
high-frequency QPOs. In general, both the amplitude and the Q value
(freq./FWHM) of low-frequency QPOs decrease as the high-frequency oscillations
increase in frequency (100 to 284 Hz) and in Q value. We speculate that the
antagonism between low-frequency and high-frequency QPOs arises from competing
structures in a perturbed accretion disk. However, we find that the frequencies
of slow (< 20 Hz) and fast (> 100 Hz) QPOs are not correlated. In addition, we
encounter systematic problems in attempting to reliably compare the QPO
frequencies with broad features in the power continuum, since there are a
variable number of such features in the power spectra. These results cast some
doubt on the reported global relationship between QPOs from neutrons stars and
those from black hole systems.

binary system that show a spatially resolved two-sided jet and an unresolved
central source. This is the first published report of such an x-ray jet seen in
an evolved stellar system comprised of ~2-3 solar masses. At E < 1 keV, the
x-ray jet extends both to the northeast and southwest relative to the central
binary system. At 1 < E < 7.1 keV, R Aqr is a point-like source centered on the
star system. While both 3.5-cm radio continuum emission and x-ray emission
appear coincident in projection and have maximum intensities at ~7.5"" northeast
of the central binary system, the next strongest x-ray component is located
\~30"" southwest of the central binary system and has no radio continuum
counterpart. The x-ray jets are likely shock heated in the recent past, and are
not in thermal equilibrium. The strongest southwest x-ray jet component may
have been shocked recently since there is no relic radio emission as expected
from an older shock. At the position of the central binary, we detect x-ray
emission below 1.6 keV consistent with blackbody emission at T ~2 x 10^6 K. At
the central star there is also a prominent 6.4 keV feature, a possible
fluorescence or collisionally excited Fe K-alpha line from an accretion disk or
from the wind of the giant star. For this excitation to occur, there must be an
unseen hard source of x-rays or particles in the immediate vicinity of the hot

quasar, FIRST J100424.9+122922, which is gravitationally-lensed by a galaxy at
z~0.95. The object was discovered as part of a program to find very red quasars
by matching the FIRST radio survey with the 2-MASS near-infrared survey.
J100424.9+122922 is the second lensed system to be found in this program,
suggesting that many gravitational lenses are probably missed from conventional
optical quasar surveys. We have made a simple lens model and a rough estimate
of the reddening in the immediate environment of the quasar which suggests that
the quasar is intrinsically very luminous and is accreting at close to the
Eddington limit of its ~10^9 M_sun black hole. The lensing galaxy has a small
amount of dust which is responsible for some excess reddening observed in the
fainter image of the quasar, but is otherwise a fairly typical massive
elliptical galaxy. We model the selection effects working against the detection
of red quasars in both lensed and unlensed samples. We show that these
selection effects are very effective at removing even lightly-reddened high
redshift quasars from magnitude-limited samples, whether they are lensed or
not. This suggests that the red quasar population in general could be very
large, and in particular the class of iron broad absorption line quasars of
which J100424.9+122922 is a member may be much larger than their rarity in
magnitude-limited samples would suggest.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204501v2,"The Amplitude Evolution and Harmonic Content of Millisecond Oscillations
  in Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts","  We present a comprehensive observational and theoretical analysis of the
amplitudes and profiles of oscillations that occur during thermonuclear X-ray
bursts from weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. Our
sample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer. The oscillations that we examined occurred primarily during
the decaying portions of bursts, and lasted for several seconds each. We find
that the oscillations are as large as 15% during the declines of the bursts,
and they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractional
amplitudes. However, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the
underlying flux in the burst. We derive folded profiles for each oscillation
train to study the pulse morphologies. The mean rms amplitudes of the
oscillations are 5%, although the eclipsing source MXB 1659-298 routinely
produces 10% oscillations in weak bursts. We also produce combined profiles
from all of the oscillations from each source. Using these pulse profiles, we
place upper limits on the fractional amplitudes of harmonic and half-frequency
signals of 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively (95% confidence). We then compare the
pulse morphologies to theoretical profiles from models with one or two
antipodal bright regions on the surface of a rotating neutron star. We find
that if one bright region is present on the star, it must either lie near the
rotational pole or cover nearly half the neutron star in order to be consistent
with the observed lack of harmonic signals. If an antipodal pattern is present,
the hot regions must form very near the rotational equator. We discuss how
these geometric constraints challenge current models for the production of
brightness variations on the surface of a neutron star. (abridged)

Galaxies (LBGs) in the region of the Hubble Deep Field North, derived from the
1 Ms public Chandra observation. Of our sample of 148 LBGs, four are detected
individually. This immediately gives a measure of the bright AGN fraction in
these galaxies of $\sim 3$~per cent, which is in agreement with that derived
from the UV spectra. The X-ray color of the detected sources indicates that
they are probably moderately obscured. Stacking of the remainder shows a
significant detection ($6\sigma$) with an average luminosity of $3.5 \times
10^{41}$~erg s$^{-1}$ per galaxy in the rest frame 2-10 keV band. We have also
studied a comparison sample of 95 z$\sim 1$ ``Balmer Break'' galaxies. Eight of
these are detected directly, with at least two clear AGN based on their high
X-ray luminosity and very hard X-ray spectra respectively. The remainder are of
relatively low luminosity ($<10^{42}$~erg s$^{-1}$), and the X-rays could arise
from either AGN or rapid star-formation. The X-ray colors and evidence from
other wavebands favor the latter interpretation. Excluding the clear AGN, we
deduce a mean X-ray luminosity of $6.6 \times 10^{40}$~erg s$^{-1}$, a factor
$\sim 5$ lower than the LBGs. The average ratio of the UV and X-ray
luminosities of these starforming galaxies $L_{\rm UV}/L_{\rm X}$, however, is
approximately the same at $z = 1$ as it is at $z = 3$. This scaling implies
that the X-ray emission follows the current star formation rate, as measured by
the UV luminosity. We use our results to constrain the star formation rate at
$z\sim 3$ from an X-ray perspective (truncated).

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0209056v2,Reionization of Hydrogen and Helium by Early Stars and Quasars,"  We compute the reionization histories of hydrogen and helium due to the
ionizing radiation fields produced by stars and quasars. For the quasars we use
a model based on halo-merger rates that reproduces all known properties of the
quasar luminosity function at high redshifts. The less constrained properties
of the ionizing radiation produced by stars are modeled with two free
parameters: (i) a transition redshift, z_tran, above which the stellar
population is dominated by massive, zero-metallicity stars and below which it
is dominated by a Scalo mass function; (ii) the product of the escape fraction
of stellar ionizing photons from their host galaxies and the star-formation
efficiency, f_esc f_*. We constrain the allowed range of these free parameters
at high redshifts based on the lack of the HI Gunn-Peterson trough at z<6 and
the upper limit on the total intergalactic optical depth for electron
scattering, tau_es<0.18, from recent cosmic microwave background (CMB)
experiments. We find that quasars ionize helium by a redshift z~4, but cannot
reionize hydrogen by themselves before z~6. A major fraction of the allowed
combinations of f_esc f_* and z_tran lead to an early peak in the ionized
fraction due to metal-free stars at high redshifts. This sometimes results in
two reionization epochs, namely an early HII or HeIII overlap phase followed by
recombination and a second overlap phase. Even if early overlap is not
achieved, the peak in the visibility function for scattering of the CMB often
coincides with the early ionization phase rather than with the actual
reionization epoch. Consequently, tau_es does not correspond directly to the
reionization redshift. We generically find values of tau_es>7%, that should be
detectable by the MAP satellite.

compact, supernova remnant N103B. The unprecedented spatial resolution of
Chandra reveals sub-arcsecond structure, both in the brightness and in spectral
variations. Underlying these small-scale variations is a surprisingly simple
radial structure in the equivalent widths of the strong Si and S emission
lines. We investigate these radial variations through spatially resolved
spectroscopy using a plane-parallel, non-equilibrium ionization model with
multiple components. The majority of the emission arises from components with a
temperature of 1 keV: a fully ionized hydrogen component; a high ionization
timescale (n_e*t > 10^12 s cm^-3) component containing Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe;
and a low ionization timescale (n_e*t ~ 10^{11} s cm^-3) O, Ne, and Mg
component. To reproduce the strong Fe Kalpha line, it is necessary to include
additional Fe in a hot (> 2 keV), low ionization (n_e*t ~ 10^10.8 s cm^-3)
component. This hot Fe may be in the form of hot Fe bubbles, formed in the
radioactive decay of clumps of 56Ni. We find no radial variation in the
ionization timescales or temperatures of the various components. Rather, the Si
and S equivalent widths increase at large radii because these lines, as well as
those of Ar and Ca, are formed in a shell occupying the outer half of the
remnant. A shell of hot Fe is located interior to this, but there is a large
region of overlap between these two shells. In the inner 30% of the remnant,
there is a core of cooler, 1 keV Fe. We find that the distribution of the
ejecta and the yields of the intermediate mass species are consistent with
model prediction for Type Ia events.

< 333 deg) of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. This survey combines the high
resolution of the Australia Telescope Compact Array with the full brightness
temperature information of the Parkes single dish telescope. In particular, we
focus on the abundance and temperature of the cool atomic clouds in the inner
galaxy. The resulting mean opacity of the HI, <kappa>, is measured as a
function of Galactic radius; it increases going in from the solar circle, to a
peak in the molecular ring of about four times its local value. This suggests
that the cool phase is more abundant there, and colder, than it is locally.
  The distribution of cool phase temperatures is derived in three different
ways. The naive, ``spin temperature'' technique overestimates the cloud
temperatures, as expected. Using two alternative approaches we get good
agreement on a histogram of the cloud temperatures, T(cool), corrected for
blending with warm phase gas. The median temperature is about 65 K, but there
is a long tail reaching down to temperatures below 20 K. Clouds with
temperatures below 40 K are common, though not as common as warmer clouds (40
to 100 K).
  Using these results we discuss two related quantities, the peak brightness
temperature seen in emission surveys, and the incidence of clouds seen in HI
self-absorption. Both phenomena match what would be expected based on our
measurements of <kappa> and T(cool).

dark matter halos, there are reasons for believing that at least three
different types of dark matter halos exist in the Universe classified by their
masses M and the inner slope of mass density -\alpha: Population A (galaxies):
10^{10} h^{-1} M_\odot < M < 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot, \alpha = 2;
Population B (cluster halos): M > 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot, \alpha =
1.3; and Population C (dwarf halos): M < 10^{10} h^{-1} M_\odot, \alpha = 1.3.
In this paper we calculate the lensing probability produced by such a compound
population of dark halos, for both image separation and time delay, assuming
that the mass function of halos is given by the Press-Schechter function and
the Universe is described by an LCDM, OCDM, or SCDM model. The LCDM model is
normalized to the WMAP observations, OCDM and SCDM models are normalized to the
abundance of rich clusters. We compare the predictions of the different
cosmological models with observational data and show that, both LCDM and OCDM
models are marginally consistent with the current available data, but the SCDM
model is ruled out. The fit of the compound model to the observed correlation
between splitting angle and time delay is excellent but the fit to the number
vs splitting angle relation is only adequate using the small number of sources
in the objective JVAS/CLASS survey. A larger survey of the same type would have
great power in discriminating among cosmological models. Furthermore,
population C in an LCDM model has a unique signature in the time domain, an
additional peak at ~3 seconds potentially observable in GRBs, which makes it
distinguishable from variants of CDM scenarios, such as warm dark matter,
repulsive dark matter, or collisional dark matter.

point, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The
solutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid
particles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively
removed by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is
dominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is
equipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the
fast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the
electromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The
results indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy
dissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot
of energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity
is small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation
of the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the
rotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk. This is
in contrast with the evolution of small-scale magnetic fields where if the
resistivity is nonzero the magnetic energy density is likely to be
equipartitioned with the kinetic energy density associated with local random
motions (e.g., turbulence), making a thin Keplerian disk possible.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304292v3,Halo Substructure And The Power Spectrum,"  (ABRIDGED) We present a semi-analytic model to explore merger histories,
destruction rates, and survival probabilities of substructure in dark matter
halos and use it to study the substructure populations of galaxy-sized halos as
a function of the power spectrum. We successfully reproduce the subhalo
velocity function and radial distribution seen in N-body simulations for
standard LCDM. We explore the implications of spectra with normalizations and
tilts spanning sigma_8 = 0.65-1 and n = 0.8-1. We also study a running index
(RI) model with dn/dlnk=-0.03, as discussed in the first year WMAP report, and
several WDM models with masses m_W = 0.75, 1.5, 3.0 keV. The substructure mass
fraction is relatively insensitive to the tilt and overall normalization of the
power spectrum. All CDM-type models yield projected substructure mass fractions
that are consistent with, but on the low side of, estimates from strong lens
systems: f = 0.4-1.5% (64 percentile) in systems M_sub < 10^9 Msun. Truncated
models produce significantly smaller fractions and are disfavored by lensing
results. We compare our predicted subhalo velocity functions to the dwarf
satellite population of the Milky Way. Assuming isotropic velocity dispersions,
we find the standard n=1 model overpredicts the number of MW satellites as
expected. Models with less small-scale power are more successful because there
are fewer subhalos of a given circular velocity and the mapping between
observed velocity dispersion and halo circular velocity is markedly altered.
The RI model, or a fixed tilt with sigma_8=0.75, can account for the MW dwarfs
without the need for differential feedback; however, these comparisons depend
sensitively on the assumption of isotropic velocities in satellite galaxies.

source G357.7-0.1 (the ""Tornado""). Observations made with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory demonstrate the presence of up to three sources of X-ray emission
from the Tornado: a relatively bright region of dimensions 2'x1' coincident
with and interior to the brightest radio emission at the ""head"" of the Tornado,
plus two fainter extended regions possibly associated with the Tornado's
""tail"". No X-ray point sources associated with the Tornado are seen down to a
3-sigma luminosity (0.5-10 keV) of 1e33 ergs/s, for a distance to the system of
12 kpc. The spectrum of the brightest region of X-rays is consistent with a
heavily absorbed (N_H ~ 1e23 cm^-2) thermal plasma of temperature kT ~ 0.6 keV;
an absorbed power law can also fit the data, but implies an extremely steep
photon index. From these data we tentatively conclude that the Tornado is a
supernova remnant (SNR), although we are unable to rule out the possibility
that the Tornado is powered either by outflows from an X-ray binary or by the
relativistic wind of an unseen pulsar. Within the SNR interpretation, the head
of the Tornado is a limb-brightened radio shell containing centrally-filled
thermal X-rays and which is interacting with a molecular cloud. We therefore
propose that the Tornado is a ""mixed morphology"" supernova remnant. The unusual
tail component of the Tornado remains unexplained in this interpretation, but
might result from expansion of the SNR into an elongated progenitor wind
bubble.

with the CTIO 1.3--meter telescope and the ANDICAM instrument, a dual
optical/infrared imager with a dichroic centered at one micron. Without the
need for light curve interpolation to produce snapshot broadband spectra, we
show that the transient spectrum remained statistically achromatic from day 2.7
to day 5.6, during a re-brightening episode. Associating the light in these
early epochs with the GRB afterglow, we infer a modest level of extinction due
to the host galaxy in the line--of--sight toward the GRB: A_V(host) = 0.30 +/-
0.03 mag for beta = -0.5 and A_V(host) < 0.4 mag (3 sigma) for any physically
plausible value of beta (with flux f_nu ~ lambda^-beta). We conclude that the
spectral slope of the afterglow component was more than beta = -0.8 between day
2.7-5.6 after the GRB, excluding the possibility that the synchrotron cooling
break passed through the optical/IR bandpass over that period. Taking
extinction into account, a decomposition of the light curve into an afterglow
and supernova component requires the presence of a supernova similar to that of
SN 1998bw, an afterglow that shows some evidence for a second break around day
8-10, and a fifth re-brightening event around day 15. Assuming an SN
1988bw-like evolution and a contemporaneous GRB and SN event, the peak SN
brightness was M_V = -19.8 +/- 0.4 - 5 log h_65 mag.

detectors allows improved imaging and spectroscopy for hard X-ray imaging above
100 keV. The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) will employ
relatively thick (5 - 10 mm) CZT detectors, which are required to perform the
broad energy-band sky survey. Interaction depth information is needed to
correct events to the detector ""focal plane"" for correct imaging and can be
used to improve the energy resolution of the detector at high energies by
allowing event-based corrections for incomplete charge collection. Background
rejection is also improved by allowing low energy events from the rear and
sides of the detector to be rejected. We present experimental results of
interaction depth sensing in a 5 mm thick pixellated Au-contact IMARAD CZT
detector. The depth sensing was done by making simultaneous measurements of
cathode and anode signals, where the interaction depth at a given energy is
proportional to the ratio of cathode/anode signals. We demonstrate how a simple
empirical formula describing the event distributions in the cathode/anode
signal space can dramatically improve the energy resolution. We also estimate
the energy and depth resolution of the detector as a function of the energy and
the interaction depth. We also show a depth-sensing prototype system currently
under development for EXIST in which cathode signals from 8, 16 or 32 crystals
can be read-out by a small multi-channel ASIC board that is vertically
edge-mounted on the cathode electrode along every second CZT crystal boundary.
This allows CZT crystals to be tiled contiguously with minimum impact on
throughput of incoming photons. The robust packaging is crucial in EXIST, which
will employ very large area imaging CZT detector arrays.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0311514v2,21 Centimeter Fluctuations from Cosmic Gas at High Redshifts,"  The relatively large Thomson optical depth, tau_e, inferred recently from the
WMAP observations suggests that the Universe was reionized in a more complex
manner than previously believed. However, the value of tau_e provides only an
integral constraint on the history of reionization and, by itself, cannot be
used to determine the nature of the sources responsible for this transition.
Here, we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic
medium at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21
centimeter radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical
description of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a
formalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both
frequency and angular scale. Prior to and following reionization, fluctuations
in the 21 cm signal are mediated by density perturbations in the distribution
of matter. Between these epochs, pockets of gas surrounding luminous objects
become ionized, producing large HII regions. These ``bubbles'' of ionized
material imprint features into the 21 cm power spectrum that make it possible
to distinguish them from fluctuations produced by the density perturbations.
The variation of the power spectrum with frequency can be used to infer the
evolution of this process. As has been emphasized previously by others, the
absolute 21 cm signal from neutral gas at high redshifts is undetectable owing
to contamination by foreground sources. However, we argue that this source of
noise can be suppressed by comparing maps closely spaced in frequency, i.e.
redshift, so that 21 cm fluctuations from the IGM can be measured against a
much brighter, but smoothly varying (in frequency) background.

Mrk348. The line is redshifted by about 130 km s^-1 with respect to the
systemic velocity, is extremely broad, with a FWHM of 130 km s^-1, and has no
detectable high velocity components within 1500 km s^-1 on either side of the
observed line. The unusual line profile led us to suspect that this source,
might belong to a class of megamaser galaxies in which the amplified emission
is the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching
molecular cloud, rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk. Our initial
VLBA observations show that the maser emission emanates entirely from a region
<0.25 pc in extent, located toward a continuum component thought to be
associated with the receding jet. The very high linewidth occurring on such
small spatial scales and the rapid variability indicate that the H_2O emission
is likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic
jet material and the molecular gas in the cloud where the jet is boring
through. The orientation of the radio jets close to the plane of the sky also
results in shocks with the preferred orientation for strong masers from our
vantage point. Single-dish monitoring with the Effelsberg 100m telescope showed
that the line and continuum emission ""flared"" on very similar timescales. The
close temporal correlation between this activity in the maser emission and the
continuum flare further suggest that the masing region and the continuum
hotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different
manifestations of the same dynamical events.

matter haloes with a suite of cosmological N-body simulations and use our
results to test analytic models. We consider constant equation of state models,
and allow both w>-1 and w<-1. Using five simulations with w ranging from -1.5
to -0.5, and with more than ~1600 well-resolved haloes each, we show that the
halo concentration model of Bullock et al. (2001) accurately predicts the
median concentrations of haloes over the range of w, halo masses, and redshifts
that we are capable of probing. We find that the Bullock et al. (2001) model
works best when halo masses and concentrations are defined relative to an outer
radius set by a cosmology-dependent virial overdensity. For a fixed power
spectrum normalization and fixed-mass haloes, larger values of w lead to higher
concentrations and higher halo central densities, both because collapse occurs
earlier and because haloes have higher virial densities. While precise
predictions of halo densities are quite sensitive to various uncertainties, we
make broad comparisons to galaxy rotation curve data. At fixed power spectrum
normalization (fixed sigma_8), w>-1 quintessence models seem to exacerbate the
central density problem relative to the standard w=-1 model. Meanwhile w<-1
models help to reduce the apparent discrepancy. We confirm that the Jenkins et
al. (2001) halo mass function provides an excellent approximation to the
abundance of haloes in our simulations and extend its region of validity to
include models with w<-1.

lines at 6.65 and 6.95 keV in the persistent emission of the dipping low-mass

at 1.48 keV, 2.67 kev, 7.82 keV and 8.29 keV consistent with Mg XII, S XVI, Ni
XXVII K alpha and Fe XXVI K beta transitions, respectively. Such absorption
lines from highly ionized ions are now observed in a number of high inclination
(ie. close to edge-on) LMXBs, such as XB 1916-053, where the inclination is
estimated to be between 60-80 degrees. This, together with the lack of any
orbital phase dependence of the features (except during dips), suggests that
the highly ionized plasma responsible for the absorption lines is located in a
cylindrical geometry around the compact object. Using the ratio of Fe XXV and
Fe XXVI column densities, we estimate the photo-ionization parameter of the
absorbing material to be 10^{3.92} erg cm s^{-1}. Only the Fe XXV line is
observed during dipping intervals and the upper-limits to the Fe XXVI column
density are consistent with a decrease in the amount of ionization during
dipping intervals. This implies the presence of cooler material in the line of
sight during dipping. We also report the discovery of a 0.98 keV absorption
edge in the persistent emission spectrum. The edge energy decreases to 0.87 keV
during deep dipping intervals. The detected feature may result from edges of
moderately ionized Ne and/or Fe with the average ionization level decreasing
from persistent emission to deep dipping. This is again consistent with the
presence of cooler material in the line of sight during dipping.

galaxy cluster Abell 267. The object, which we call ""PALS1"", was found in a
survey aimed at identifying highly-magnified Lyman-break galaxies in the fields
of intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the source had U>24.7 (2-sigma;
AB), g=21.96, and very blue g-r and r-i colors; i.e., PALS1 was a U-band
drop-out, characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at z~3. However,
three months later the source had faded by more than three magnitudes. Further
observations showed a continued decline in luminosity, to R>26.4 seven months
after discovery. Though the apparent brightness is suggestive of a supernova at
roughly the cluster redshift, we show that the photometry and light curve argue
against any known type of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy
distribution and location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent
with the hypothesis that PALS1 is a gravitationally-lensed transient at z~3.3.

by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) during major mergers of
spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation,
and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto
supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We
assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black
hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that
regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers
nuclear gas inflow which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole
accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN
feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short
timescale,particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive
powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of
the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black
holes. Without AGN, gas-rich mergers lead to ellipticals which remain blue
owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyrs have elapsed. In
contrast, mergers with black holes produce ellipticals that redden much faster,
an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete
termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r ~ 2.3 in
less than one Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population
of extremely red massive early type-galaxies, and it appears to be an important
driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the
Local Universe.

Eulerian TVD and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) -- and a
spectrophotometric analysis in the U_n, G, R filter set. The simulated galaxies
at z=2 satisfy the color-selection criteria proposed by Adelberger et al.
(2004) and Steidel et al. (2004) when we assume Calzetti extinction with
E(B-V)=0.15. We find that the number density of simulated galaxies brighter
than R<25.5 at z=2 is about 1e-2 h^3 Mpc^-3 for E(B-V)=0.15, which is roughly
twice that of the number density found by Erb et al. (2004) for the UV bright
sample. This suggests that roughly half of the massive galaxies with M*>10^{10}
Msun/h at z=2 are UV bright population, and the other half is bright in the
infra-red wavelengths. The most massive galaxies at z=2 have stellar masses >=
10^{11-12} Msun. They typically have been continuously forming stars with a
rate exceeding 30 Msun/yr over a few Gyrs from z=10 to z=2, together with
significant contribution by starbursts reaching up to 1000 Msun/yr which lie on
top of the continuous component. TVD simulations indicate a more sporadic star
formation history than the SPH simulations. Our results do not imply that
hierarchical galaxy formation fails to account for the observed massive
galaxies at z>=1. The global star formation rate density in our simulations
peaks at z>=5, a much higher redshift than predicted by the semianalytic
models. This star formation history suggests early build-up of the stellar mass
density, and predicts that 70 (50, 30)% of the total stellar mass at z=0 had
already been formed by z=1 (2, 3). Upcoming observations by Spitzer and Swift

  Approach","  Cold accretion disks such as those in star-forming systems, quiescent
cataclysmic variables, and some active galactic nuclei, are expected to have
neutral gas which does not couple well to magnetic fields. The turbulent
viscosity in such disks must be hydrodynamic in origin, not
magnetohydrodynamic. We investigate the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in
a linear shear flow sandwiched between two parallel walls. The unperturbed flow
is similar to plane Couette flow but with a Coriolis force included. Although
there are no exponentially growing eigenmodes in this system, nevertheless,
because of the non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, it is possible to have a
large transient growth in the energy of perturbations. For a constant angular
momentum disk, we find that the perturbation with maximum growth has a
wave-vector in the vertical direction. The energy grows by more than a factor
of 100 for a Reynolds number R=300 and more than a factor of 1000 for R=1000.
Turbulence can be easily excited in such a disk, as found in previous numerical
simulations. For a Keplerian disk, on the other hand, similar vertical
perturbations grow by no more than a factor of 4, explaining why the same
simulations did not find turbulence in this system. However, certain other
two-dimensional perturbations with no vertical structure do exhibit modest
growth. For the optimum two-dimensional perturbation, the energy grows by a
factor of ~100 for R~10^4.5 and by a factor of 1000 for R~10^6. It is
conceivable that these two-dimensional disturbances might lead to
self-sustained turbulence. The Reynolds numbers of cold astrophysical disks are
much larger even than 10^6, therefore, hydrodynamic turbulence may be possible
in disks.

  Energy Growth","  Despite observational evidence for cold neutral astrophysical accretion
disks, the viscous process which may drive the accretion in such systems is not
yet understood. While molecular viscosity is too small to explain the observed
accretion efficiencies by more than ten orders of magnitude, the absence of any
linear instability in Keplerian accretion flows is often used to rule out the
possibility of turbulent viscosity. Recently, the fact that some fine tuned
disturbances of any inviscid shear flow can reach arbitrarily large transient
growth has been proposed as an alternative route to turbulence in these
systems. We present an analytic study of this process for 3D plane wave
disturbances of a general rotating shear flow in Lagrangian coordinates, and
demonstrate that large transient growth is the generic feature of
non-axisymmetric disturbances with near radial leading wave vectors. The
maximum energy growth is slower than quadratic, but faster than linear in time.
The fastest growth occurs for two dimensional perturbations, and is only
limited by viscosity, and ultimately by the disk vertical thickness.
  After including viscosity and vertical structure, we find that, as a function
of the Reynolds number, R, the maximum energy growth is approximately 0.4
(R/log R)^{2/3}, and put forth a heuristic argument for why R > 10^4 is
required to sustain turbulence in Keplerian disks. Therefore, assuming that
there exists a non-linear feedback process to replenish the seeds for transient
growth, astrophysical accretion disks must be well within the turbulent regime.
However, large 3D numerical simulations running for many orbital times, and/or
with fine tuned initial conditions, are required to confirm Keplerian
hydrodynamic turbulence on the computer.

hydrodynamic simulations -- Eulerian TVD and SPH -- of a concordance Lambda CDM

by these extremely red objects (EROs): (1) the mass-scale, and (2) red colors.
We perform spectrophotometric analyses of simulated galaxies in B, z, R, I, Js,
Ks, K filters, and compare their near-IR properties with observations at
redshift z=1-3. We find that the simulated galaxies brighter than the magnitude

density of a few \times 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} at z~2, in good agreement with the
observed number density in the K20 survey. Therefore, our hydrodynamic
simulations do not exhibit the ``mass-scale problem''. The answer to the
``redness problem'' is less clear because of our poor knowledge of the amount
of dust extinction in EROs and the uncertain fraction of star-forming EROs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502241v1,A Physical Model for the Origin of Quasar Lifetimes,"  We propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which observational quasar
lifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are strongly
distinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.
Quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part of
the accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities powering
accretion. In this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but the
quasar is buried. Eventually, feedback from accretion energy disperses
surrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observable
optically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required to
maintain a quasar luminosity. We model this process and measure the unobscured
and intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxy
merger. The source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,
calculated from local gas properties. We calculate the column density of
hydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these column
densities and gas metallicities to determine B-band attenuation of the source.
Defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observed
B-band luminosity above some limit L_B,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 Myr for
L_B,min=10^11 L_sun (M_B=-23), in good agreement with observationally
determined quasar lifetimes. This is significantly smaller than the intrinsic
lifetime ~100 Myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. The ratio of observed
to intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosity
and the observed frequency.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504190v2,Black Holes in Galaxy Mergers: Evolution of Quasars,"  Based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a model
in which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassive
black holes in galaxies. Nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision
triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration
of the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas and
dust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and UV
wavelengths. Eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and
expels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. Between buried and dead
phases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous
quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of
obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this
phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed
luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a
function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10
Myr for bright quasars in the optical B-band, in good agreement with empirical
estimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 Myr,
naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. However,
observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands
as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We
obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the
quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees
remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from
the SDSS for appropriate luminosity thresholds. (Abridged)

  Quasar Luminosity Functions","  We consider implications of our new model of quasar lifetimes and light
curves for the quasar luminosity function (LF) at different frequencies and
redshifts. In our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and the lifetime depends on
both their instantaneous and peak luminosities. The bright end of the LF traces
the peak intrinsic quasar activity, but the faint end consists of quasars which
are either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the observed LF corresponds
directly to the maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities,
which falls off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. We study this model
using simulations of galaxy mergers which successfully reproduce a wide range
of observed quasar phenomena, including the observed column density
distribution. By combining quasar lifetimes and the distribution of maximum
quasar luminosities determined from the observed hard X-ray LF with the
corresponding luminosity and host-system dependent column densities, we produce
the expected soft X-ray and B-band LFs. Our predictions agree exceptionally
well with the observed LFs at all observed luminosities, over the redshift
range considered (z < 1), without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about an
obscured population of sources. Our results also suggest that observed
correlations in hard X-ray samples between the obscured fraction of quasars and
luminosity can be explained in the context of our model by the expulsion of
surrounding gas due to heating from accretion feedback energy as a quasar nears
its peak luminosity and final black hole mass.

by blue continua that extend to the Lyman limit punctuated by broad emission
lines including transitions of O VI, N V, Si IV, and C IV. The continuum of WX
Hyi can be fit with a white dwarf model with physically reasonable model
parameters, but neither system actually shows unambiguous signatures of white
dwarf emission. The shape and flux of the spectrum of SS Cyg cannot be
self-consistently reconciled with a white dwarf providing all of the FUV
continuum flux. Combination white dwarf/disk or white dwarf/optically thin
plasma models improve the fit but still do not give physically reasonable model
parameters for a quiescent dwarf nova. Assuming that the UV emission lines
arise from the disk, the line shapes indicate that surface fluxes fall roughly
as R^{-2} in both systems. Fits to the double-peaked line profiles in SS Cyg
indicate that the FUV line forming region is concentrated closer to the white
dwarf than that of the optical lines and provide no evidence of a hole in the
inner disk. Although the flux from SS Cyg was relatively constant during all of
our observations, WX Hyi showed significant variability during the GHRS

detected. Their radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions are similar,
except for PKS0941-080, which is X-ray under-luminous by about two orders of
magnitude. The comparison between the full sample of GPS galaxies with
measurements in hard X-rays and a control sample of radio galaxies rules out
intrinsic X-ray weakness as causing a lower detection rate of GPS sources in
X-ray surveys. Four out of seven GPS galaxies exhibit high X-ray column
densities, whereas for the remaining three this measurement is hampered by the
poor spectral statistics. Bearing in mind the low number statistics in both the
GPS and the control sample, the average column density measured in GPS galaxies
is larger than in FRI or Broad Line Region FR II radio galaxies, but consistent
with that measured in High-Excitation FRII galaxies. This leads to a location
the absorbing gas in an obscuring ``torus'', which prevents us from observing
the nuclear region along lines-of-sight perpendicular to the radio axis. This
interpretation is supported by the discovery of rapid (timescale ~1000 s) X-ray

implications on the properties of damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) using
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We vary both the wind strength and the
internal parameters of the the wind model in a series of cosmological SPH
simulations that include radiative cooling and heating by a UV background, star
formation, and feedback from supernovae and galactic winds. To test our
simulations, we examine the DLA `rate-of-incidence' as a function of halo mass,
galaxy apparent magnitude, and impact parameter. We find that the statistical
distribution of DLAs does not depend on the exact values of internal numerical
parameters that control the decoupling of hydrodynamic forces when the gas is
ejected from starforming regions. The DLA rate-of-incidence in our simulations
at z=3 is dominated by the faint galaxies with apparent magnitude R_AB < 25.5.
However, interestingly in a `strong wind' run, the differential distribution of
DLA sight-lines is peaked at Mhalo = 10^{12} Msun/h (R_AB~27), and the mean DLA
halo mass is Mmean=10^{12.4} Msun/h (R_AB ~ 26). These mass-scales are much
larger than those if we ignore winds, because galactic wind feedback suppresses
the DLA cross section in low-mass halos and increases the relative contribution
to the DLA incidence from more massive halos. The DLAs in our simulations are
more compact than the present-day disk galaxies, and the impact parameter
distribution is very narrow unless we limit the search for the host galaxy to
only bright LBGs. The comoving number density of DLAs is higher than that of
LBGs down to R_AB=30 mag if the physical radius of each DLA is smaller than 5

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512218v1,Weak Gravitational Lensing of High-Redshift 21 cm Power Spectra,"  We describe the effects of weak gravitational lensing by cosmological large
scale structure on the diffuse emission of 21 centimeter radiation from neutral
hydrogen at high redshifts during the era of reionization. The ability to
observe radial information through the frequency, and thus three-dimensional
regions of the background radiation at different redshifts, suggests that 21 cm
studies may provide a useful context for studying weak lensing effects. We
focus on the gravitational lensing effects on both the angular power spectra
and the intrinsic, three-dimensional power spectra. We present a new approach
for calculating the weak lensing signature based on integrating differential
Fourier-space shells of the deflection field and approximating the
magnification matrix. This method is applied to reionization models of the 21
cm spectra up to small angular scales over a range in redshift. The effect on
the angular power spectrum is typically < 1% on small angular scales, and very
small on scales corresponding to the feature imprinted by reionization bubbles,
due to the near-scale invariance of the angular power spectrum of the 21 cm
signal on these scales. We describe the expected effect of weak lensing on
three-dimensional 21 cm power spectra, and show that lensing creates aspherical
perturbations to the intrinsic power spectrum which depend on the polar angle
of the wavevector. The effect on the 3D power spectrum is < 1% on scales k <
0.1 h/Mpc, but can be > 1% for highly inclined modes for k > 1 h/Mpc. The
angular variation of the lensing effect on these scales is well described by a
quartic polynomial in the cosine of the polar angle. The detection of the
gravitational lensing effects on 21 cm power spectra will require very
sensitive, high resolution observations by future low-frequency radio arrays.

begin by estimating their birth space velocity distribution from proper motion
measurements of Brisken et al. (2002, 2003). We find no evidence for
multimodality of the distribution and favor one in which the absolute
one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially distributed and with a
three-dimensional mean velocity of 380^{+40}_{-60} km s^-1. We then proceed
with a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modelling the birth properties
of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and
Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We present a population model that appears
generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest that pulsars
are born in the spiral arms, with a Galactocentric radial distribution that is
well described by the functional form proposed by Yusifov & Kucuk (2004), in
which the pulsar surface density peaks at radius ~3 kpc. The birth spin period
distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of
multimodality. Models which assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to be
independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are inadequate, as they
lead to the detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations.
Dithered radio luminosities proportional to the square root of the spin-down
luminosity accommodate the observations well and provide a natural mechanism
for the pulsars to dim uniformly as they approach the death line, avoiding an
observed pile-up on the latter. There is no evidence for significant torque
decay (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the
pulsars as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate
and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.

surveys of the Galaxy, we explore the chemical abundance properties and
phase-space distributions in hierarchically-formed stellar halo simulations set
in a LambdaCDM Universe. Our sample of Milky-Way type stellar halo simulations
result in average metallicities that range from [Fe/H] = -1.3 to -0.9, with the
most metal poor halos resulting from accretion histories that lack destructive
mergers with massive (metal rich) satellites. Our stellar halo metallicities
increase with stellar halo mass. The slope of the [Fe/H]-stellar mass trend
mimics that of the satellite galaxies that were destroyed to build the halos,
implying that the relation propagates hierarchically. All simulated halos
contain a significant fraction of old stellar populations accreted more than 10
Gyr ago and in a few cases, some intermediate age populations exist. In
contrast with the Milky Way, many of our simulated stellar halos contain old
stellar populations which are metal rich, originating in the early accretion of
massive satellites. We suggest that the (metal rich) stellar halo of M31 falls
into this category, while the more metal poor halo of the Milky Way is lacking
in early massive accretion events. Interestingly, our hierarchically-formed
stellar halos often have non-negligible metallicity gradients in both [Fe/H]
and [alpha/Fe]. These gradients extend a few tens of kpc, and can be as large
as 0.5 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.2 dex in [alpha/Fe]. Finally, we find that chemical
abundances can act as a rough substitute for time of accretion of satellite
galaxies. We propose a criterion for identifying tidal streams spatially by
selecting stars with [alpha/Fe] ratios below solar.

similar evolution, at redshifts 0<z<~1.5. Knowing one of the quasar, merger, or
elliptical mass/luminosity functions, it is possible to predict the others.
Allowing for greater model dependence, we compare the rate of early-type
buildup with the implied merger and quasar triggering rates as a function of
mass and redshift and find agreement. Over this redshift range, observed merger
fractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function and
buildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift
(>~10^11 M_solar at z<~0.3) where 'dry' mergers appear to dominate. This
supports a necessary prediction of theories where mergers between gas-rich
galaxies produce ellipticals with an associated phase of quasar activity, after
which the remnant becomes red. These populations trace a similar characteristic
transition mass, possibly reflecting the mass above which the elliptical
population is mostly (>~50%) assembled at a given redshift, which increases
with redshift over the observed range in a manner consistent with suggestions
that cosmic downsizing may apply to red galaxy assembly as well as star
formation. These mass distributions as a function of redshift do not uniformly

of KBOs by Neptune-mass planets (``oligarchs''), (4) eviction of excess

circularize by dynamical friction, (6) planetary migration and capture of

starbursts and 'buried quasars' until accretion feedback expels the gas,
rendering a briefly visible optical quasar. Star formation is shut down and
accretion declines, leaving a passively evolving remnant with properties

radiative cooling via photon diffusion and emission on the other hand, drives
oscillations with a period approximately equal to the H-burning timescale. If
these oscillations grow, the gradually rising temperature at the base of the
helium layer eventually provokes a thin-shell thermal instability and hence a
delayed mixed burst. For Mdot > 0.25 Mdot_Edd, there is no instability or
overstability, and there are no bursts. Nearly all other theoretical models
predict that bursts should occur for all Mdot < Mdot_Edd, in conflict with both
our results and observations. We suggest that this discrepancy arises from the
assumed strength of the hot CNO cycle breakout reaction 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne in
these other models. That observations agree much better with the results of
Narayan & Heyl and our two-zone model, both of which neglect breakout
reactions, may imply that the true 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne cross section is much
smaller than assumed in previous investigations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605678v2,"An Observational Determination of the Bolometric Quasar Luminosity
  Function","  We combine a large set of quasar luminosity function (QLF) measurements from
the rest-frame optical, soft and hard X-ray, and near- and mid-infrared bands
to determine the bolometric QLF in the redshift interval z=0-6. Accounting for
the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of spectral
energy distribution (SED) shapes, and their dependence on luminosity, makes it
possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a
baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey.
We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z~4.5 and confirm
at high significance (>10sigma) previous claims of a flattening in both the
faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the
column density distribution and quasar SED, which both depend on luminosity, a
single bolometric QLF self-consistently reproduces the observed QLFs in all
bands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this
luminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric QLF and there
is no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the
expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray
background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find they are
consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total quasar luminosity
density is well-constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We provide a number of fitting
functions to the bolometric QLF and its manifestations in various bands, and a
script to return the QLF at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits,
as the most simple inferences from the QLF measured in a single band can be
misleading.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606001v2,Estimators for local non-Gaussianities,"  We study the Likelihood function of data given f_NL for the so-called local
type of non-Gaussianity. In this case the curvature perturbation is a
non-linear function, local in real space, of a Gaussian random field. We
compute the Cramer-Rao bound for f_NL and show that for small values of f_NL
the 3-point function estimator saturates the bound and is equivalent to
calculating the full Likelihood of the data. However, for sufficiently large
f_NL, the naive 3-point function estimator has a much larger variance than
previously thought. In the limit in which the departure from Gaussianity is
detected with high confidence, error bars on f_NL only decrease as 1/ln Npix
rather than Npix^-1/2 as the size of the data set increases. We identify the
physical origin of this behavior and explain why it only affects the local type
of non-Gaussianity, where the contribution of the first multipoles is always
relevant. We find a simple improvement to the 3-point function estimator that
makes the square root of its variance decrease as Npix^-1/2 even for large
f_NL, asymptotically approaching the Cramer-Rao bound. We show that using the
modified estimator is practically equivalent to computing the full Likelihood
of f_NL given the data. Thus other statistics of the data, such as the 4-point
function and Minkowski functionals, contain no additional information on f_NL.
In particular, we explicitly show that the recent claims about the relevance of
the 4-point function are not correct. By direct inspection of the Likelihood,
we show that the data do not contain enough information for any statistic to be
able to constrain higher order terms in the relation between the Gaussian field
and the curvature perturbation, unless these are orders of magnitude larger
than the size suggested by the current limits on f_NL.

  quantifying disc and jet contributions","  The optical/near-infrared (OIR) region of the spectra of low-mass X-ray
binaries appears to lie at the intersection of a variety of different emission
processes. In this paper we present quasi-simultaneous OIR - X-ray observations
of 33 XBs in an attempt to estimate the contributions of various emission
processes in these sources, as a function of X-ray state and luminosity. A
global correlation is found between OIR and X-ray luminosity for low-mass black
hole candidate XBs (BHXBs) in the hard X-ray state, of the form L_OIR is
proportional to Lx^0.6. This correlation holds over 8 orders of magnitude in Lx
and includes data from BHXBs in quiescence and at large distances (LMC and
M31). A similar correlation is found in low-mass neutron star XBs (NSXBs) in
the hard state. For BHXBs in the soft state, all the near-infrared (NIR) and
some of the optical emission is suppressed below the correlation, a behaviour
indicative of the jet switching off/on in transition to/from the soft state. We
compare these relations to theoretical models of a number of emission
processes. We find that X-ray reprocessing in the disc and emission from the
jets both predict a slope close to 0.6 for BHXBs, and both contribute to the
OIR in BHXBs in the hard state, the jets producing ~90 percent of the NIR
emission at high luminosities. X-ray reprocessing dominates the OIR in NSXBs in
the hard state, with possible contributions from the jets (only at high
luminosity) and the viscously heated disc. We also show that the optically
thick jet spectrum of BHXBs extends to near the K-band. (abridged)

  Progenitors of Short-Duration Hard-Spectrum Bursts","  Starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-duration
hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (SHB) by Swift last year, a growing body of
evidence has suggested that SHBs are associated with an older and
lower-redshift galactic population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases,
with large (>~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putative
host galaxies. Here we present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB
detected by Swift and localized by the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We find a massive
red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec from
our revised XRT position. Using associative and probabilistic arguments we
suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this
offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc in
projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any SHB to date and
almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset.
Spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host show
it to have undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB
060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the GRB explosion
since birth is tau = 1.3 +- 0.2 Gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the SHB
progenitor is v_kick = 55 +- 15 km/s.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of mass ~10^9 Msun when the Universe was less
than one billion years old. This finding presents several challenges for
theoretical models. Here, we present the first multi-scale simulations that,
together with a self-regulated model for the SMBH growth, produce a luminous
quasar at z ~ 6.5 in the LCDM paradigm. We follow the hierarchical assembly
history of the most massive halo in a ~ 3 Gpc^3 volume, and find that this halo
of ~ 8x 10^{12} Msun forming at z ~ 6.5 after several major mergers is able to
reproduce a number of observed properties of SDSS J1148+5251, the most distant
quasar detected at z =6.42 (Fan et al. 2003). Moreover, the SMBHs grow through
gas accretion below the Eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing to
feedback. We find that the progenitors experience significant star formation
(up to 10^4 Msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellar
mass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} Msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent with
observations of significant metal enrichment in SDSS J1148+5251. Our results
provide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard LCDM

quasars and the fundamental SMBH-host correlation in a hierarchical

fundamental unknowns about our Universe. Over the past decade more than 200
extra-solar planets have been discovered, providing new urgency for addressing
this question in these or other planetary systems. Independently of this

constructed with the goal of detecting 21cm emission from cosmic hydrogen in

the Mileura Wide-Field Array (MWA), will cover in 8 kHz bins the entire
frequency range of 80-300 MHz, which is perfectly matched to the band over
which our civilization emits most of its radio power. We show that this and
other low-frequency observatories (culminating with the Square Kilometer Array

civilization out to a distance of ~10^{1-2.7}pc, within a spherical volume
containing 10^{3-8}x(Omega_b/4*pi)^alpha stars, where alpha=1 (or 1.5) for a
radar beam of solid angle Omega_b that remains steady (or sweeps) across the
sky. Such a radio signal will show-up as a series of narrow spectral lines that
do not coincide with known atomic or molecular lines. The high spectral
resolution attainable with the upcoming observatories will allow to monitor the
periodic Doppler shift of the broadcasted lines over the planet's orbital
period around the parent star. Determination of the parent star mass through
observations of its spectrum could then be used to infer the inclination,
semi-major axis and eccentricity of the planet's orbit. This, in turn, will

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610817v1,Self-Similar Force-Free Wind From an Accretion Disk,"  We consider a self-similar force-free wind flowing out of an infinitely thin
disk located in the equatorial plane. On the disk plane, we assume that the
magnetic stream function $P$ scales as $P\propto R^\nu$, where $R$ is the
cylindrical radius. We also assume that the azimuthal velocity in the disk is
constant: $v_\phi = Mc$, where $M<1$ is a constant. For each choice of the
parameters $\nu$ and $M$, we find an infinite number of solutions that are
physically well-behaved and have fluid velocity $\leq c$ throughout the domain
of interest. Among these solutions, we show via physical arguments and
time-dependent numerical simulations that the minimum-torque solution, i.e.,
the solution with the smallest amount of toroidal field, is the one picked by a
real system. For $\nu \geq 1$, the Lorentz factor of the outflow increases
along a field line as $\gamma \approx M(z/\Rfp)^{(2-\nu)/2} \approx R/R_{\rm
A}$, where $\Rfp$ is the radius of the foot-point of the field line on the disk
and $R_{\rm A}=\Rfp/M$ is the cylindrical radius at which the field line
crosses the Alfven surface or the light cylinder. For $\nu < 1$, the Lorentz
factor follows the same scaling for $z/\Rfp < M^{-1/(1-\nu)}$, but at larger
distances it grows more slowly: $\gamma \approx (z/\Rfp)^{\nu/2}$. For either
regime of $\nu$, the dependence of $\gamma$ on $M$ shows that the rotation of
the disk plays a strong role in jet acceleration. On the other hand, the
poloidal shape of a field line is given by $z/\Rfp \approx
(R/\Rfp)^{2/(2-\nu)}$ and is independent of $M$. Thus rotation has neither a
collimating nor a decollimating effect on field lines, suggesting that
relativistic astrophysical jets are not collimated by the rotational winding up
of the magnetic field.

spectral variability on time-scales from a few tens of ksec to years. We found
in both cases highly significant spectral variability below ~ 6 keV down to the
shortest time-scales investigated. These variations can be naturally explained
in terms of variations in the low energy cut-off due to obscuring matter along
the line of sight. If the cut-off is modeled by two neutral absorption
components, one fully covering the source and the second covering only a
fraction of the source, the shortest time-scale of variability of a few days
constrains the location of the obscuring matter to within 3.4 X 10^4
Schwarzschild radii from the central X-ray source. This is consistent with the
distance of the Broad Emission Line Region, as inferred from reverberation
mapping, and difficult to reconcile with the parsec scale dusty molecular torus
of Krolik & Begelman (1988). We have also explored a more complex absorption
structure, namely the presence of an ionized absorber. Although the behaviour
of the ionization parameter is nicely consistent with the expectations, the
results are not completely satisfactory from the statistical point of view.
  The overall absorption during the 2001 December observation is lower than in
all other historical observations with similar 2-10 keV flux. This suggests
that absorption variability plays a crucial role in the observed flux
variability of this source.

interpret the emerging body of observational data on star-forming galaxies at
z>~6. The efficiency and duty cycle of the star formation activity within dark
matter halos are determined by fitting the luminosity functions of Lya emitter
and Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~5-6. Using our model parameters we
predict the likely abundance of star forming galaxies at earlier epochs and
compare these to the emerging data in the redshift interval 7<z<10. We find
that the abundance of luminous Lyman-break galaxies in the 500 Myr between z~6
and 10 can be naturally explained by the hierarchical assembly of dark matter
haloes; there is only marginal evidence for strong physical evolution. In
contrast, the first estimates of the abundance of less luminous star forming
galaxies at z=9-10 are higher than predicted and, if verified by further data,
may suggest a top-heavy stellar mass function at these early epochs. Although
these abundances remain uncertain because of the difficulty of spectroscopic
confirmation and cosmic variance, even a modest improvement in survey
capability with present or upcoming facilities should yield great progress. In
this context, we use our model to consider those observational techniques that
hold the most promise and make predictions for specific surveys that are, or
will soon be, underway. We conclude that narrowband Lya emitter surveys should
be efficient on searches at z~7-8; however, such conventional surveys are
unlikely to detect sufficient galaxies at z~10 to provide useful constraints.
For this reason, gravitational lensing offers the best prospect for probing the

field dark energy, Cuscuton, which can be realized as the incompressible (or
infinite speed of sound) limit of a k-essence fluid. In this paper, we study
how Cuscuton modifies the constraint sector of Einstein gravity. In particular,
we study Cuscuton cosmology and show that even though Cuscuton can have an
arbitrary equation of state, or time dependence, and is thus inhomogeneous; its
perturbations do not introduce any additional dynamical degree of freedom and
only satisfy a constraint equation, amounting to an effective modification of
gravity on large scales. Therefore, Cuscuton can be considered to be a minimal
theory of evolving dark energy, or a minimal modification of a cosmological
constant, as it has no internal dynamics. Moreover, this is the only
modification of Einstein gravity to our knowledge that does not introduce any
additional degrees freedom (and is not conformally equivalent to the Einstein
gravity). We then study two simple Cuscuton models, with quadratic and
exponential potentials. The quadratic model has the exact same expansion
history as LCDM, and yet contains an early dark energy component with constant
energy fraction, which is constrained to < 2%, mainly from WMAP Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and SDSS Lyman-alpha forest observations. The
exponential model has the same expansion history as the DGP self-accelerating
braneworld model, but generates a much smaller Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect, and is thus consistent with the CMB observations. Finally, we show that
the evolution is local on super-horizon scales, implying that there is no gross

of modern telescopes, the photometric evolution of galaxies destined to host

nearby relaxed clusters. To assess the impact of galaxy formation, we compare
two sets of simulations, one performed in the non-radiative regime and another
with radiative cooling and several physical processes critical to various
aspects of galaxy formation: star formation, metal enrichment and stellar
feedback. We show that the observed ICM properties outside cluster cores are
well-reproduced in the simulations that include cooling and star formation,
while the non-radiative simulations predict an overall shape of the ICM
profiles inconsistent with observations. In particular, we find that the ICM
entropy in our runs with cooling is enhanced to the observed levels at radii as
large as half of the virial radius. We also find that outside cluster cores
entropy scaling with the mean ICM temperature in both simulations and Chandra
observations is consistent with being self-similar within current error bars.
We find that the pressure profiles of simulated clusters are also close to
self-similar and exhibit little cluster-to-cluster scatter. The X-ray
observable-total mass relations for our simulated sample agree with the Chandra
measurements to \~10%-20% in normalization. We show that this systematic
difference could be caused by the subsonic gas motions, unaccounted for in
X-ray hydrostatic mass estimates. The much improved agreement of simulations

the existence of tight relations of X-ray observables, such as Yx, and total
cluster mass and the simple redshift evolution of these relations hold promise
for the use of clusters as cosmological probes.

five nearby star-forming regions: the Orion A cloud, NGC 2068/71, NGC 2024/23,
Serpens and Ophiuchus. Color excess ratios E(H-Ks)/E(Ks-[lambda]) were measured
for stars without infrared excess dust emission from circumstellar
disks/envelopes.
  For four of these five regions, the extinction laws are similar at all
wavelengths and differ systematically from a previous determination of the
extinction law, which was dominated by the diffuse ISM, derived for the IRAC
bands. This difference could be due to the difference in the dust properties of
the dense molecular clouds observed here and those of the diffuse ISM. The
extinction law at longer wavelengths toward the Ophiuchus region lies between
that to the other four regions studied here and that for the ISM. In addition,
we extended our extinction law determination to 24micron for Serpens and NGC

improvement over existing models in describing local bonding for bulk defects
and disordered phases. The model consists of two- and three-body interactions
with theoretically motivated functional forms that capture chemical and
physical trends as explained in a companion paper. The numerical parameters in
the functional form are obtained by fitting to a set of ab initio results from
quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory in the local
density approximation, which include various bulk phases and defect structures.
We test the potential by applying it to the relaxation of point defects, core
properties of partial dislocations and the structure of disordered phases, none
of which are included in the fitting procedure. For dislocations, our model
makes predictions in excellent agreement with ab initio and tight-binding
calculations. It is the only potential known to describe both the 30$^\circ$-
and 90$^\circ$-partial dislocations in the glide set {111}. The structural and
thermodynamic properties of the liquid and amorphous phases are also in good
agreement with experimental and ab initio results. Our potential is the first
capable of simulating a quench directly from the liquid to the amorphous phase,
and the resulting amorphous structure is more realistic than with existing
empirical preparation methods. These advances in transferability come with no
extra computational cost, since force evaluation with our model is faster than

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0010183v1,Glassy effects in the swelling/collapse dynamics of homogeneous polymers,"  We investigate, using numerical simulations and analytical arguments, a
simple one dimensional model for the swelling or the collapse of a closed
polymer chain of size N, representing the dynamical evolution of a polymer in a
\Theta-solvent that is rapidly changed into a good solvent (swelling) or a bad
solvent (collapse). In the case of swelling, the density profile for
intermediate times is parabolic and expands in space as t^{1/3}, as predicted
by a Flory-like continuum theory. The dynamics slows down after a time \propto
N^2 when the chain becomes stretched, and the polymer gets stuck in metastable
`zig-zag' configurations, from which it escapes through thermal activation. The
size of the polymer in the final stages is found to grow as \sqrt{\ln t}. In
the case of collapse, the chain very quickly (after a time of order unity)
breaks up into clusters of monomers (`pearls'). The evolution of the chain then
proceeds through a slow growth of the size of these metastable clusters, again
evolving as the logarithm of time. We enumerate the total number of metastable
states as a function of the extension of the chain, and deduce from this
computation that the radius of the chain should decrease as 1/\ln(\ln t). We
compute the total number of metastable states with a given value of the energy,
and find that the complexity is non zero for arbitrary low energies. We also
obtain the distribution of cluster sizes, that we compare to simple
`cut-in-two' coalescence models. Finally, we determine the aging properties of
the dynamical structure. The subaging behaviour that we find is attributed to
the tail of the distribution at small cluster sizes, corresponding to
anomalously `fast' clusters (as compared to the average). We argue that this
mechanism for subaging might hold in other slowly coarsening systems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0011168v1,"Characterization of the frequency of extreme events by the Generalized
  Pareto Distribution","  Based on recent results in extreme value theory, we use a new technique for
the statistical estimation of distribution tails. Specifically, we use the
Gnedenko-Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem, which gives a natural limit law for
peak-over-threshold values in the form of the Generalized Pareto Distribution
(GPD). Useful in finance, insurance, hydrology, we investigate here the
earthquake energy distribution described by the Gutenberg-Richter seismic
moment-frequency law and analyze shallow earthquakes (depth h < 70 km) in the
Harvard catalog over the period 1977-2000 in 18 seismic zones. The whole GPD is
found to approximate the tails of the seismic moment distributions quite well
above moment-magnitudes larger than mW=5.3 and no statistically significant
regional difference is found for subduction and transform seismic zones. We
confirm that the b-value is very different in mid-ocean ridges compared to
other zones (b=1.50=B10.09 versus b=1.00=B10.05 corresponding to a power law
exponent close to 1 versus 2/3) with a very high statistical confidence. We
propose a physical mechanism for this, contrasting slow healing ruptures in
mid-ocean ridges with fast healing ruptures in other zones. Deviations from the
GPD at the very end of the tail are detected in the sample containing
earthquakes from all major subduction zones (sample size of 4985 events). We
propose a new statistical test of significance of such deviations based on the
bootstrap method. The number of events deviating from the tails of GPD in the
studied data sets (15-20 at most) is not sufficient for determining the
functional form of those deviations. Thus, it is practically impossible to give
preference to one of the previously suggested parametric families describing
the ends of tails of seismic moment distributions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9901025v14,On the Topological Nature of Fundamental Interactions,"  A thought experiment is proposed to unify quantum mechanics and general
relativity. The central paradigm is that space-time {\it topology} is
ultimately responsible for the Heisenberg uncertaintly principle. It is found
that Plankian space-time exhibits a complicated, but also definite, multiply
connected character. In this framework, an analysis of the interactions in
Nature is presented.
  I. The Universal ground state of the constructed theory derives from the
properties of the topological manifold $Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$, which has
23 intrinsic degrees of freedom, discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal
groups, an SU(5) gauge group, and leads to a U(1) symmetry on a lattice. The
structure of $Q$ provides a unique equation motion for the mass-energy and
particle rest mass wave functions. In its excited state the Universe is
characterized by a lattice of three-tori, $L(T^3)$. The topological
identifications present in this structure, a direct reflection of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, provide the boundary conditions for solutions
to the equation of motion, and suggest an interpretation for the conceptually
difficult concept of quantum mechanical entanglement. II. In the second half of
the paper the (observable) properties of $Q$ and $L(T^3)$ are investigated. One
reproduces the standard model, and the theory naturally contains a Higgs field
with possible inflation. The electron and its neutrino are identified as
particle ground states and their masses, together with those of all other known
particles, are predicted. A mass of $m_{\rm H}=131.6$ GeV is found for the
Higgs boson. [Abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9901319v4,Metric preheating and limitations of linearized gravity,"  Recently it has become clear that the resonant amplification of quantum field
fluctuations at preheating must be accompanied by resonant amplification of
scalar metric perturbations, since the two are united by Einstein's equations.
Furthermore, this ""metric preheating"" enhances particle production and leads to
gravitational rescattering effects even at linear order. In multi-field models
with strong preheating (q \gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear,
with the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \to 0).
This amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the
inflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy
perturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein
field equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial
conditions. This has serious implications at all scales - from the large-angle
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies to primordial black holes. We
investigate the (q,k) parameter space in a two-field model, and introduce the
time to nonlinearity, t_{nl}, as the timescale for the breakdown of the
linearized Einstein equations. Backreaction effects are expected to shut down
the linear resonances, but cannot remove the existing amplification, which
threatens the viability of strong preheating when confronted with the CMB. We
discuss ways to escape the above conclusions, including secondary phases of
inflation and preheating solely to fermions. Finally we rank known classes of
inflation from strongest (chaotic and strongly coupled hybrid inflation) to
weakest (hidden sector, warm inflation) in terms of the distortion of the
primordial spectrum due to these resonances in preheating.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0405243v3,"Little Hierarchy, Little Higgses, and a Little Symmetry","  Little Higgs theories are an attempt to address the little hierarchy problem,
i.e., the tension between the naturalness of the electroweak scale and the
precision measurements showing no evidence for new physics up to 5-10 TeV. In
little Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop
order from the quadratic divergence. This allows the cutoff to be raised up to
\~10 TeV, beyond the scales probed by the precision data. However, strong
constraints can still arise from the contributions of the new TeV scale
particles and hence re-introduces the fine-tuning problem. In this paper we
show that a new symmetry, denoted as T-parity, under which all heavy gauge
bosons and scalar triplets are odd, can remove all the tree-level contributions
to the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little Higgs theories
completely natural. The T-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of
little Higgs models by following the most general construction of the low
energy effective theory a la Callan, Coleman, Wess and Zumino. In particular,
we discuss in detail how to implement the T-parity in the littlest Higgs model
based on SU(5)/SO(5). The symmetry breaking scale f can be even lower than 500
GeV if the contributions from the unknown UV physics at the cutoff are somewhat
small. The existence of $T$-parity has drastic impacts on the phenomenology of
the little Higgs theories. The T-odd particles need to be pair-produced and
will cascade down to the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) which is stable. A
neutral LTP gives rise to missing energy signals at the colliders which can
mimic supersymmetry. It can also serve as a good dark matter candidate.

http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0103018v4,Effect of Trends on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis,"  Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis method used to
estimate long-range power-law correlation exponents in noisy signals. Many
noisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results
obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically
study the effects of three types of trends -- linear, periodic, and power-law
trends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data.
We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially
generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how
trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find
that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise
and the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of
these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the
amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of
the power-law trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties
of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy
signals with trends also follow scaling laws -- i.e. long-range power-law
dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We
show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the
superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend,
assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition
rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superimposed
trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in
the correlation properties of the noise.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2416v2,Fundamental Plane of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters,"  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys are considered among the most
promising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their
premise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be
affected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In
this letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that
accommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane
relationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy
clusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is
the mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ
half-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using
the Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in
mass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since
measurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ
clusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of
the cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting
cosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our
Fundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one
may naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while
including more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve
the accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of
non-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the
intracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to
reduce these errors.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3465v1,"Cosmological Simulations of the Preheating Scenario for Galaxy Cluster
  Formation: Comparison to Analytic Models and Observations","  We perform a set of non--radiative cosmological simulations of a preheated
intracluster medium in which the entropy of the gas was uniformly boosted at
high redshift. The results of these simulations are used first to test the
current analytic techniques of preheating via entropy input in the smooth
accretion limit. When the unmodified profile is taken directly from
simulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the results
of our simulations. This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the
accreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good
approximation even with a realistic accretion history. When we examine the
simulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropy
amplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. In
the second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheating
simulations to recent observations. We show -- in agreement with previous work
-- that for a reasonable amount of preheating, a satisfactory match can be
found to the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. However --
as noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of the
simulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. In particular,
while rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at large
radius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating can
simultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels. As a result,
we confirm that the simple preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, in
which entropy is injected universally at high redshift, is inconsistent with
observations.

depth, tau_eff, over the redshift range 2<z<4.2 from a sample of 86
high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise quasar spectra obtained with the ESI and
HIRES spectrographs on Keck, and with the MIKE spectrograph on Magellan. This
represents an improvement over previous analyses of the Lya forest from
high-resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of two in the
size of the data set alone. We pay particular attention to robust error
estimation and extensively test for systematic effects. We find that our
estimates of the quasar continuum levels in the Lya forest obtained by spline
fitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the bias
increasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mock
spectra. The mean fractional error is <1% at z=2, 4% at z=3, and 12% at z=4.
Previous measurements of tau_eff at z>~3 based on directly fitting the quasar
continua in the Lya forest, which have generally neglected this effect, are
therefore likely biased low. We provide estimates of the level of absorption
arising from metals in the Lya forest based on both direct and statistical
metal removal results in the literature, finding that this contribution is
~6-9% at z=3 and decreases monotonically with redshift. The high precision of
our measurement, attaining 3% in redshift bins of width Delta z=0.2 around z=3,
indicates significant departures from the best-fit power-law redshift evolution
(tau_eff=0.0018(1+z)^3.92, when metals are left in), particularly near z=3.2.
The observed downward departure is statistically consistent with a similar
feature detected in a precision statistical measurement using Sloan Digital Sky

Chandra observations and 441 archival XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic
plane (|b|<5 degree). Our search revealed four sources with periodic
variability on time scales of 200-5000 s, all of which are probably accreting
white dwarfs. We identify 7 of 12 known Galactic magnetars, but find no new
examples with periods between 5 and 20 s. We convert this non-detection into
limits on the total number of Galactic magnetars by computing the fraction of
the young Galactic stellar population that was included in our survey. We find
that easily-detectable magnetars, modeled after persistent anomalous X-ray
pulsars, could have been identified in 5% of the Galactic spiral arms by mass.
If we assume there are 3 previously-known examples within our random survey,
then there are 59 (+92,-32) in the Galaxy. Transient magnetars in quiescence
could have been identified throughout 0.4% of the spiral arms, and the lack of
new examples implies that <540 exist in the Galaxy (90% confidence). Similar
constraints are found by considering the detectability of transient magnetars
in outburst by current and past X-ray missions. For assumed lifetimes of 1e4
yr, we find that the birth rate of magnetars could range between 0.003 and 0.06
per year. Therefore, the birth rate of magnetars is at least 10% of that for
normal radio pulsars. The magnetar birth rate could exceed that of radio
pulsars, unless the lifetimes of transient magnetars are >1e5 yr. Obtaining

hotspots of the nearby FRII radio galaxy 3C 321, using new and archival data
from MERLIN, the VLA, Spitzer, HST, and Chandra. An initially collimated radio
jet extends northwest from the nucleus of its host galaxy and produces a
compact knot of radio emission adjacent (in projection) to a companion galaxy,
after which it dramatically flares and bends, extending out in a diffuse
structure 35 kpc northwest of the nucleus. We argue that the simplest
explanation for the unusual morphology of the jet is that it is undergoing an
interaction with the companion galaxy. Given that the northwest hotspot that
lies >250 kpc from the core shows X-ray emission, which likely indicates in

has been disrupted on a timescale less than the light travel time to the end of
the lobe, $\sim 10^6$ years, and that the jet flow to this hotspot will only be
disrupted for as long as the jet-companion interaction takes place. The host
galaxy of 3C 321 and the companion galaxy are in the process of merging, and
each hosts a luminous AGN. As this is an unusual situation, we investigate the
hypothesis that the interacting jet has driven material on to the companion
galaxy, triggering its AGN. Finally, we present detailed radio and X-ray
observations of both hotspots, which show that there are multiple emission
sites, with spatial offsets between the radio and X-ray emission.

  for a third body around CM Draconis","  Context: New eclipse minimum timings of the M4.5/M4.5 binary CM Dra were
obtained between the years 2000 and 2007. In combination with published timings
going back to 1977, a clear non-linearity in observed-minus-calculated (O-C)
times has become apparent. Several models are applied to explain the observed
timing behavior.
  Aims: Revealing the processes that cause the observed O-C behavior, and
testing the evidence for a third body around the CM Dra system.
  Methods: The O-C times of the system were fitted against several functions,
representing different physical origins of the timing variations.
  Results: An analysis using model-selection statistics gives about equal
weight to a parabolic and to a sinusoidal fitting function. Attraction from a
third body, either at large distance in a quasi-constant constellation across
the years of observations or from a body on a shorter orbit generating
periodicities in O-C times is the most likely source of the observed O-C times.
The white dwarf GJ 630.1B, a proper motion companion of CM Dra, can however be
rejected as the responsible third body. Also, no further evidence of the
short-periodic planet candidate described by Deeg et al. (2000) is found,
whereas other mechanisms, such as period changes from stellar winds or
Applegate's mechanism can be rejected.

period of 18.5+-4.5 years or an object in the mass range of 1.5M_jup to
0.1M_sun with periods of hundreds to thousands of years is the most likely

simple scenarios for explaining the observed Ly-a and rest-frame UV luminosity
functions (LFs) of LAEs: (i) the ""escape fraction"" scenario, in which the
""effective"" escape fraction (including the IGM attenuation) of Ly-a photons is
f_Lya ~0.1 (0.15) at z=3 (6), and (ii) the ""stochastic"" scenario, in which the
fraction of LAEs that are turned on at z=3 (6) is \Cstoc ~0.07 (0.2) after
correcting for the IGM attenuation. Our comparisons with a number of different
observations suggest that the stochastic scenario is preferred over the escape
fraction scenario. We find that the mean values of stellar mass, metallicity
and black hole mass hosted by LAEs are all smaller in the stochastic scenario
than in the escape fraction scenario. In our simulations, the galaxy stellar
mass function evolves rapidly, as expected in hierarchical structure formation.
However, its evolution is largely compensated by a beginning decline in the
specific star formation rate, resulting in little evolution of the rest-frame
UV LF from z=6 to 3. The rest-frame UV LF of both LAEs and LBGs at z=3 & 6 can
be described well by the stochastic scenario provided the extinction is
moderate, E(B-V) ~0.15, for both populations, although our simulation might be
overpredicting the number of bright LBGs at z=6. We also discuss the
correlation function and bias of LAEs. The Ly-a LFs at z=6 in a field-of-view

data cubes. The dendrogram of a data cube is an abstraction of the changing
topology of the isosurfaces as a function of contour level. The ability to
track hierarchical structure over a range of scales makes this analysis
philosophically different from local segmentation algorithms like CLUMPFIND.
Points in the dendrogram structure correspond to specific volumes in data cubes
defined by their bounding isosurfaces. We further refine the technique by
measuring the properties associated with each isosurface in the analysis
allowing for a multiscale calculation of molecular gas properties. Using
COMPLETE 13CO(1-0) data from the L1448 region in Perseus and mock observations
of a simulated data cube, we identify regions that have a significant
contribution by self-gravity to their energetics on a range of scales. We find
evidence for self-gravitation on all spatial scales in L1448 though not in all
regions. In the simulated observations, nearly all of the emission is found in
objects that would be self-gravitating if gravity were included in the
simulation. We reconstruct the size-line width relationship within the data
cube using the dendrogram-derived properties and find it follows the standard
relation: s_v ~ R^0.58. Finally, we show that constructing the dendrogram of CO
J=1-0 emission from the Orion-Monoceros region allows for the identification of
giant molecular clouds in a blended molecular line data set using only a
physically motivated definition (self-gravitating clouds with masses 5x10^4

http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3807v2,"Simulations of Ultrarelativistic Magnetodynamic Jets from Gamma-ray
  Burst Engines","  Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) require an engine capable of driving a
jet of plasma to ultrarelativistic bulk Lorentz factors of up to several
hundred and into narrow opening angles of a few degrees. We use global
axisymmetric stationary solutions of magnetically-dominated (force-free)
ultrarelativistic jets to test whether the popular magnetic-driving paradigm
can generate the required Lorentz factors and opening angles. Our global
solutions are obtained via time-dependent relativistic ideal magnetodynamical
numerical simulations which follow the jet from the central engine to beyond
six orders of magnitude in radius. Our model is primarily motivated by the
collapsar model, in which a jet is produced by a spinning black hole or neutron
star and then propagates through a massive stellar envelope. We find that the
size of the presupernova progenitor star and the radial profile of pressure
inside the star determine the terminal Lorentz factor and opening angle of the
jet. At the radius where the jet breaks out of the star, our well-motivated
fiducial model generates a Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 400$ and a half-opening
angle $\theta_j\sim 2^\circ$, consistent with observations of many
long-duration GRBs. Other models with slightly different parameters give
$\gamma$ in the range 100 to 5000 and $\theta_j$ from $0.1^\circ$ to
$10^\circ$, thus reproducing the range of properties inferred for GRB jets. A
potentially observable feature of some of our solutions is that the maximum
Poynting flux in the jet is found at $\theta \sim \theta_j$ with the jet power
concentrated in a hollow cone, while the maximum in the Lorentz factor occurs
at an angle $\theta$ substantially smaller than $\theta_j$ also in a hollow
cone. [abridged]

  simulation of a LambdaCDM universe","  We explore galaxy properties and their link with environment and clustering
using a population of ~1000 galaxies formed in a high resolution hydrodynamic
simulation of the Lambda CDM cosmology. At the redshift we concentrate on, z=1,
the spatial resolution is 1.4 proper kpc/h and Milky-way sized disk galaxies
contain ~10^5 particles within their virial radii. We include supermassive
black hole accretion and feedback as well as a multiphase model for star
formation. We find that a number of familiar qualitative relationships hold
approximately between galaxy properties, for example, galaxies lie between two
broad extremes of type, where ``late'' types tend to be smaller in size, have
lower circular velocities, younger stars, higher star formation rates, larger
disk to bulge ratios and lower Sersic indices than ``early types''. As in
previous studies the stellar component of disk galaxies is not as rotationally
supported as in observations. Bulges contain too much of the stellar mass,
although disks do have scale lengths compatible with observations. The addition
of black hole physics to the simulations does not appear to have an impact on
the angular momentum results, nor do we find that it is affected in an
identical simulation with significantly lower mass resolution. Despite this, we
can profitably use the rank order of either disk to total ratio, Sersic index,
or galaxy age to separate galaxies into morphological classes and examine the
density-morphology relation and morphology dependence of clustering. We find
that while at redshift z=0, the well known preponderance of early types in
dense environments is seen, at z=1 the density-morphology relation becomes
flatter and late type galaxies are even seen to have a higher clustering
amplitude than early types (abridged).

http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2097v1,Pluto's Light Curve in 1933-1934,"  We are reporting on a new accurate photographic light curve of Pluto for
1933-1934 when the heliocentric distance was 40 AU. We used 43 B-band and
V-band images of Pluto on 32 plates taken on 15 nights from 19 March 1933 to 10
March 1934. Most of these plates were taken with the Mount Wilson 60"" and 100""
telescopes, but 7 of the plates (now at the Harvard College Observatory) were
taken with the 12"" and 16"" Metcalf doublets at Oak Ridge. The plates were
measured with an iris diaphragm photometer, which has an average one-sigma
photometric error on these plates of 0.08 mag as measured by the repeatability
of constant comparison stars. The modern B and V magnitudes for the comparison
stars were measured with the Lowell Observatory Hall 1.1-m telescope. The
magnitudes in the plate's photographic system were converted to the Johnson B-
and V-system after correction with color terms, even though they are small in
size. We find that the average B-band mean opposition magnitude of Pluto in
1933-1934 was 15.73 +- 0.01, and we see a roughly sinusoidal modulation on the
rotational period (6.38 days) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.11 +- 0.03
mag. With this, we show that Pluto darkened by 5% from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955.
This darkening from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955 cannot be due to changing viewing
geometry (as both epochs had identical sub-Earth latitudes), so our
observations must record a real albedo change over the southern hemisphere. The
later darkening trend from 1954 to the 1980s has been explained by changing
viewing geometry (as more of the darker northern hemisphere comes into view).
Thus, we now have strong evidence for albedo changes on the surface of Pluto,
and these are most easily explained by the systematic sublimation of frosts
from the sunward pole that led to a drop in the mean surface albedo.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3032v1,Testing earthquake predictions,"  Statistical tests of earthquake predictions require a null hypothesis to
model occasional chance successes. To define and quantify `chance success' is
knotty. Some null hypotheses ascribe chance to the Earth: Seismicity is modeled
as random. The null distribution of the number of successful predictions -- or
any other test statistic -- is taken to be its distribution when the fixed set
of predictions is applied to random seismicity. Such tests tacitly assume that
the predictions do not depend on the observed seismicity. Conditioning on the
predictions in this way sets a low hurdle for statistical significance.
Consider this scheme: When an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater occurs
anywhere in the world, predict that an earthquake at least as large will occur
within 21 days and within an epicentral distance of 50 km. We apply this rule
to the Harvard centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) catalog for 2000--2004 to generate
a set of predictions. The null hypothesis is that earthquake times are
exchangeable conditional on their magnitudes and locations and on the
predictions--a common ``nonparametric'' assumption in the literature. We
generate random seismicity by permuting the times of events in the CMT catalog.
We consider an event successfully predicted only if (i) it is predicted and
(ii) there is no larger event within 50 km in the previous 21 days. The
$P$-value for the observed success rate is $<0.001$: The method successfully
predicts about 5% of earthquakes, far better than `chance,' because the
predictor exploits the clustering of earthquakes -- occasional foreshocks --
which the null hypothesis lacks. Rather than condition on the predictions and
use a stochastic model for seismicity, it is preferable to treat the observed
seismicity as fixed, and to compare the success rate of the predictions to the
success rate of simple-minded predictions like those just described. If the
proffered predictions do no better than a simple scheme, they have little
value.

star-forming cores with the particular goal to identify and understand
evolutionary trends in core properties, and to explore the nature of Very Low
Luminosity Objects (< 0.1 L_sun; VeLLOs). METHODS: Using the MAMBO bolometer
array, we create maps unusually sensitive to faint (few mJy per beam) extended

Complementary information on embedded stars is obtained from Spitzer, IRAS, and
2MASS. RESULTS: Our maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize
extended emission features (``subcores'') and compact intensity peaks in our
data separately to pay attention to this complexity. We derive, e.g., sizes,
masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well as column densities and
related properties for the peaks. Combination with archival infrared data then
enables the derivation of bolometric luminosities and temperatures, as well as
envelope masses, for the young embedded stars. CONCLUSIONS: (abridged) Starless
and star-forming cores occupy the same parameter space in many core properties;
a picture of dense core evolution in which any dense core begins to actively
form stars once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e.g., mass, density, or both,
is inconsistent with our data. Comparison of various evolutionary indicators
for young stellar objects in our sample (e.g., bolometric temperatures) reveals
inconsistencies between some of them, possibly suggesting a revision of some of
these indicators.

Resolution Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space

faint companion at a separation of 0\farcs17. A second HST observation 1.04 yr
later confirms orbital motion in a retrograde direction. By combining our two
measures with the spectroscopic orbit of Kamper and an analysis of the
Hipparcos and FK5 proper motions by Wielen et al., we find a mass for Polaris
Aa of 4.5^{+2.2}_{-1.4} M_\odot--the first purely dynamical mass determined for
any Cepheid. For the faint companion Polaris Ab we find a dynamical mass of
1.26^{+0.14}_{-0.07} M_\odot, consistent with an inferred spectral type of F6 V
and with the flux difference of 5.4 mag observed at 2255\AA. The magnitude
difference at the V band is estimated to be 7.2 mag. Continued HST observations
will significantly reduce the mass errors, which are presently still too large
to provide critical constraints on the roles of convective overshoot, mass
loss, rotation, and opacities in the evolution of intermediate-mass stars.
  Our astrometry, combined with two centuries of archival measurements, also
confirms that the well-known, more distant (18"") visual companion, Polaris B,
has a nearly common proper motion with that of the Aa,Ab pair. This is
consistent with orbital motion in a long-period bound system. The ultraviolet
brightness of Polaris B is in accordance with its known F3 V spectral type if
it has the same distance as Polaris Aa,Ab.

infrared quasars (IR QSOs) in the local universe based on the spectra from the
Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The MIR properties
of IR QSOs are compared with those of optically-selected Palomar-Green QSOs (PG
QSOs) and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The average MIR spectral
features from ~ 5 to 30um, including the spectral slopes, 6.2um PAH emission
strengths and [NeII] 12.81um luminosities of IR QSOs, differ from those of PG
QSOs. In contrast, IR QSOs and ULIRGs have comparable PAH and [NeII]
luminosities. These results are consistent with IR QSOs being at a transitional
stage from ULIRGs to classical QSOs. We also find that the colour index
alpha(30, 15) is a good indicator of the relative contribution of starbursts to
AGNs for all QSOs. Correlations between the [NeII] 12.81um and PAH 6.2um
luminosities and those between the [NeII], PAH with 60um luminosities for
ULIRGs and IR QSOs indicate that both [NeII] and PAH luminosities are
approximate star formation rate indicators for IR QSOs and starburst-dominated
galaxies; the scatters are, however, quite large (~ 0.7 to 0.8 dex). Finally
the correlation between the EW(PAH 6.2um) and outflow velocities suggests that
star formation activities are suppressed by feedback from AGNs and/or
supernovae.

  Background, Cosmic Star Formation, and Quasar Activity","  We investigate the implications of the intergalactic opacity for the
evolution of the cosmic UV luminosity density and its sources. Our main
constraint is our measurement of the Lya forest opacity at redshifts 2<z<4.2
from 86 high-resolution quasar spectra. In addition, we impose the requirements
that HI must be reionized by z=6 and HeII by z~3, and consider estimates of the
hardness of the ionizing background from HI to HeII column density ratios. The
derived hydrogen photoionization rate is remarkably flat over the Lya forest
redshift range covered. Because the quasar luminosity function is strongly
peaked near z~2, the lack of redshift evolution indicates that star-forming
galaxies likely dominate the photoionization rate at z>~3. Combined with direct
measurements of the galaxy UV luminosity function, this requires only a small
fraction f_esc~0.5% of galactic hydrogen ionizing photons to escape their
source for galaxies to solely account for the entire ionizing background. Under
the assumption that the galactic UV emissivity traces the star formation rate,
current state-of-the-art observational estimates of the star formation rate
density appear to underestimate the total photoionization rate at z~4 by a
factor ~4, are in tension with recent determinations of the UV luminosity
function, and fail to reionize the Universe by z~6 if extrapolated to
arbitrarily high redshift. A theoretical star formation history peaking earlier
fits the Lya forest photoionization rate well, reionizes the Universe in time,
and is in better agreement with the rate of z~4 gamma-ray bursts observed by
Swift. Quasars suffice to doubly ionize helium by z~3 and likely contribute a
non-negligible and perhaps dominant fraction of the hydrogen ionizing
background at their z~2 peak. [Abridged]

galaxies 3C 305, DA 240, and 4C 73.08, and investigate the origin of their
nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclei of the three sources appear to have
different relative contributions of accretion- and jet-related X-ray emission,
as expected based on earlier work. The X-ray spectrum of the FRII narrow-line
radio galaxy (NLRG) 4C 73.08 is modeled with the sum of a heavily absorbed
power law that we interpret to be associated with a luminous accretion disk and
circumnuclear obscuring structure, and an unabsorbed power law that originates
in an unresolved jet. This behavior is consistent with other narrow-line radio
galaxies. The X-ray emission of the low-excitation FRII radio galaxy DA 240 is
best modeled as an unabsorbed power law that we associate with a parsec-scale
jet, similar to other low-excitation sources that we have studied previously.
However, the X-ray nucleus of the narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 305 shows no
evidence for the heavily absorbed X-ray emission that has been found in other
NLRGs. It is possible that the nuclear optical spectrum in 3C 305 is
intrinsically weak-lined, with the strong emission arising from extended
regions that indicate the presence of jet--environment interactions. Our
observations of 3C 305 suggest that this source is more closely related to
other weak-lined radio galaxies. This ambiguity could extend to other sources
currently classified as NLRGs. We also present XMM-Newton and VLA observations
of the hotspot of DA 240, arguing that this is another detection of X-ray
synchrotron emission from a low-luminosity hotspot.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2988v1,Extending Recovery of the Primordial Matter Power Spectrum,"  The shape of the primordial matter power spectrum Plin(k) encodes critical
information on cosmological parameters. At large scales, the observable galaxy
power spectrum Pobs(k) is expected to follow the shape of Plin(k), but on
smaller scales the effects of nonlinearity and galaxy bias make the ratio
Pobs(k)/Plin(k) scale-dependent. We develop a method that can extend the
dynamic range of the Plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on the
galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) from the projected galaxy correlation
function wp. We devise an analytic model to calculate Pobs(k) in real-space and
redshift-space. Once HOD parameters are determined by matching wp for a given
cosmological model, galaxy bias is completely specified, and our analytic model
predicts both the shape and normalization of Pobs(k). Applying our method to
SDSS main galaxy samples, we find that the real-space Pobs(k) follows the shape
of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the 1-2% level up to k=0.2 h/Mpc.
When we apply our method to SDSS LRG samples, the linear bias approximation is
accurate to 5% at k<0.08 h/Mpc, but the scale-dependence of LRG bias prevents
the use of linear theory at k>0.08 h/Mpc. Our HOD model prediction is in good
agreement with the recent SDSS LRG Pobs(k) measurements at all measured scales
(k<0.2 h/Mpc), naturally explaining the shape of Pobs(k). The ""Q-model""
prescription is a poor description of galaxy bias for the LRG samples, and it
can lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates when measurements at k>0.1
h/Mpc are included in the analysis. We quantify the potential bias and
constraints on cosmological parameters that arise from applying linear theory
and Q-model fitting, and we demonstrate the utility of HOD modeling of future
high precision measurements of Pobs(k) on quasi-linear scales.

without strong feedback to observations at z=0. We confirm previous findings
that models without strong feedback overproduce the observed galaxy baryonic
mass function, especially at the low and high mass extremes. Through
post-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to
reproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme
form of ""preventive"" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic
mass that was originally accreted via ""hot mode"" from shock-heated gas. This
does not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement
with observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at
high redshift from baryons that originally accreted via ""cold mode"" onto lower
mass progenitors. An efficient ""ejective"" feedback mechanism, such as supernova
driven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. Feedback must also
reduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts
and have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically re-map galaxy
masses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation's
predicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the
observed sequence of star-forming galaxies but fail to recover the observed
population of passive, low star formation rate galaxies. Suppressing all hot
mode accretion improves agreement for high mass galaxies but worsens the
agreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z=0 observations requires a
feedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of
galaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other
galaxies essentially unchanged.

of 0.52 < q < 0.65, a white dwarf mass of 0.44 < M1(Msol) < 0.65, and a donor
star mass of 0.23 < M2(Msol) < 0.44. Conclusions. We find that the donor star
in HS 0218+3229 is significantly undermassive for its spectral type. It is
therefore very likely that it has undergone nuclear evolution prior to the
onset of mass transfer.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4554v3,"A New Calculation of the Ionizing Background Spectrum and the Effects of
  HeII Reionization","  The ionizing background determines the ionization balance and the
thermodynamics of the cosmic gas. It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to
theoretical and empirical studies of both the IGM and galaxy formation. We
present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical
constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity
functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model,
star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the HI
ionizing field at z<3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher
redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we
explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how
recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that
recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of
reemitted ionizing photons as many of these rapidly redshift below the
ionization edges and have a distribution of energies. A simple analytic model
that captures the main effects seen in our numerical radiative transfer
calculations is given. Finally, we discuss the effects of HeII reionization by
quasars on both the spectrum of the ionizing background and on the thermal
history of the IGM. In regions that have yet to be reionized, the spectrum is
expected to be almost completely suppressed immediately above 54.4 eV while a
background of higher-energy (>~0.5 keV) photons permeates the entire universe
owing to the frequency-dependence of the photoionization cross section. We
provide an analytic model of the heat input during HeII reionization and its
effects on the temperature-density relation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4787v5,CfA3: 185 Type Ia Supernova Light Curves from the CfA,"  We present multi-band photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia), with over
11500 observations. These were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the F. L.
Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).
This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reduced
nearby SN Ia (z < 0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby
sample, bringing SN Ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties
dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or better
in BVRIr'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We
also estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system
BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our standard system
photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars, where
available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths
mag in most cases. We find that 1991bg-like SN Ia are sufficiently distinct
from other SN Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that
they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training
samples. The CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better
light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where
near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle
host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic
uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2591v2,The Role of Dwarf Galaxies in Building Large Stellar Halos,"  The hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smaller
galactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. The past
decade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, driven
in part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. Multi-object spectroscopy
enabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the Milky Way
and M31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. Improvements in
high-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundance
patterns of the Milky Way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained by
Galactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.
  These breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearby
stars in the Milky Way and luminous red giant stars in M31 and Local Group
dwarf satellites. In the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allow
observations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, and
they will enable observations of individual stars far out in the Galactic halo.
The chemical abundance census now available for the Milky Way will become
possible for our nearest neighbor, M31. Velocity dispersion measurements now
available in M31 will become possible for systems beyond the Local Group such
as Sculptor and M81 Group galaxies. Detailed studies of a greater number of
individual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satellites
will test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemical
evolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses in
different environments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2998v1,The Formation and Architecture of Young Planetary Systems,"  Newly-formed planetary systems with ages of <10 Myr offer many unique
insights into the formation, evolution, and fundamental properties of
extrasolar planets. These planets have fallen beyond the limits of past
surveys, but as we enter the next decade, we stand on the threshold of several
crucial advances in instrumentation and observing techniques that will finally
unveil this critical population. In this white paper, we consider several
classes of planets (inner gas giants, outer gas giants, and ultrawide
planetary-mass companions) and summarize the motivation for their study, the
the observational tests that will distinguish between competing theoretical
models, and the infrastructure investments and policy choices that will best
enable future discovery. We propose that there are two fundamental questions
that must be addressed: 1) Do planets form via core accretion, gravitational
instability, or a combination of the two methods? 2) What do the atmospheres an
interiors of young planets look like, and does the mass-luminosity relation of
young planets more closely resemble the ""hot start"" or ""cold start"" models? To
address these questions, we recommend investment in high-resolution NIR
spectrographs (existing and new), support for innovative new techniques and
pathfinder surveys for directly-imaged young exoplanets, and continued
investment in visible-light adaptive optics to allow full characterization of
wide ""planetary-mass"" companions for calibrating planet evolutionary models. In
summary, testing newly proposed planet formation and evolutionary predictions
will require the identification of a large population of young (<10 Myr)
planets whose orbital, atmospheric, and structural properties can be studied.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0669v4,Correlation Probes of a QCD Critical Point,"  Critical opalescence is a characteristic experimental signature of a second
order phase transition in solid state physics. A new, experimentally accessible
measure of opacity and of attenuation length in heavy ion reactions is
suggested, as a combination of HBT radii and nuclear modification factors. This
opacity is maximal when $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, the system size and centrality
correspond to the critical point of QCD. To characterize the phase transition
at this critical point, the critical exponent of the correlation function can
be determined by measuring the L\'evy index of stability of the Bose-Einstein
or HBT correlations. The exponent of the correlation length can be determined
from fits to the multiplicity distribution in various pseudorapidity intervals,
also as a function of colliding energy, system size, centrality and (chemical)
freeze-out temperature. These two critical exponents determine the remaining
four critical exponents and the universality class of this second order phase
transition. As a control experiment, the determination of the critical exponent
of the specific heat capacity is proposed, from event-by-event fluctuation
measurements. To measure opacity precisely, well calibrated high transverse
momentum probes are needed, such as given by the excitation function of
$\gamma$ + jet correlation functions.

weak interactions within the framework of the Standard Model and in theoretical
predictions of the primordial abundance of 4He in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In
previous work, we successfully demonstrated the trapping of ultracold neutrons
(UCN) in a conservative potential magnetic trap. A major upgrade of the
apparatus is nearing completion at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). In our approach, a beam of 0.89
nm neutrons is incident on a superfluid 4He target within the minimum field
region of an Ioffe-type magnetic trap. A fraction of the neutrons is
downscattered in the helium to energies <200 neV, and those in the appropriate
spin state become trapped. The inverse process is suppressed by the low phonon
density of helium at temperatures less than 200 mK, allowing the neutron to
travel undisturbed. When the neutron decays the energetic electron ionizes the
helium, producing scintillation light that is detected using photomultiplier
tubes. Statistical limitations of the previous apparatus will be alleviated by
significant increases in field strength and trap volume resulting in twenty
times more trapped neutrons.

  Black Hole Binaries Among Luminous AGN","  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic nuclei are thought to
be a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for
the circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital
decay of SMBHBs with a range of total masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through
physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take
over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is in the
stalled ""secondary-dominated"" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of
10^7 years at orbital periods t_var between a day and a year. A dedicated
optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a
population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance N_var is
proportional to t_var^alpha, in a range of periods t_var around tens of weeks.
SMBHBs with M < 10^7 M_sun, with 0.5 < alpha < 1.5, would probe the physics of
viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass
binaries, with alpha=8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The
lowest mass SMBHBs (M < 10^{5-6} M_sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short
orbital periods, in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space
Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are strongly sub-dominant in the last
few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved
background of near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss constraints on the SMBHB
population available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage
requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified
from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of
SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.

questions about when and where the majority of metals were formed, how they

stellar and galactic scales. X-ray absorption studies have evolved in recent

http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3385v1,Structure and Evolution of Pre-Main Sequence Stars,"  Low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars are strong and variable X-ray
emitters, as has been well established by EINSTEIN and ROSAT observatories. It
was originally believed that this emission was of thermal nature and primarily
originated from coronal activity (magnetically confined loops, in analogy with
Solar activity) on contracting young stars. Broadband spectral analysis showed
that the emission was not isothermal and that elemental abundances were
non-Solar. The resolving power of the Chandra and XMM X-ray gratings
spectrometers have provided the first, tantalizing details concerning the
physical conditions such as temperatures, densities, and abundances that
characterize the X-ray emitting regions of young star. These existing high
resolution spectrometers, however, simply do not have the effective area to
measure diagnostic lines for a large number of PMS stars over required to
answer global questions such as: how does magnetic activity in PMS stars differ
from that of main sequence stars, how do they evolve, what determines the
population structure and activity in stellar clusters, and how does the
activity influence the evolution of protostellar disks. Highly resolved

currently available will provide major advances in answering these questions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2966v2,Equivalence Principle Implications of Modified Gravity Models,"  Theories that attempt to explain the observed cosmic acceleration by
modifying general relativity all introduce a new scalar degree of freedom that
is active on large scales, but is screened on small scales to match
experiments. We show that if such screening occurrs via the chameleon mechanism
such as in f(R), it is possible to have order one violation of the equivalence
principle, despite the absence of explicit violation in the microscopic action.
Namely, extended objects such as galaxies or constituents thereof do not all
fall at the same rate. The chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge for
large objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by the
gravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). This leads to
order one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan
frame, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if
the scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld
model, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. We
propose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. small
galaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical friction
is negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared to
standard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should have
different velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical mass
estimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones. We
discuss possible pitfalls in some of these tests. The cleanest is the third one
where mass estimate from HI rotational velocity could exceed that from stars by
30 % or more. To avoid blanket screening of all objects, the most promising
place to look is in voids.

obtained for exoplanets, the Deep Impact spacecraft obtained light curves of
Earth at seven wavebands spanning 300-1000 nm as part of the EPOXI mission of
opportunity. In this paper we analyze disc-integrated light curves, treating
Earth as if it were an exoplanet, to determine if we can detect the presence of
oceans and continents. We present two observations each spanning one day, taken
at gibbous phases. The rotation of the planet leads to diurnal albedo
variations of 15-30%, with the largest relative changes occuring at the reddest
wavelengths. To characterize these variations in an unbiased manner we carry
out a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this
analysis reveals that 98% of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only
2 dominant eigencolors. We use the time-variations of these two eigencolors to
construct longitudinal maps of the Earth, treating it as a non-uniform Lambert
sphere. We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors
correspond to cloud-free continents and oceans; this despite the fact that our
observations were taken on days with typical cloud cover. We also find that the
near-infrared wavebands are particularly useful in distinguishing between land
and water. Based on this experiment we conclude that it should be possible to
infer the existence of water oceans on exoplanets with time-resolved broadband
observations taken by a large space-based coronagraphic telescope.

resolution X-ray spectra as enabled by the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings
should be considered a powerful and viable new resource for delving into a
relatively unexplored regime for directly determining dust properties:
composition, quantity, and distribution. We present initial cross-section
measurements of astrophysically likely iron-based dust candidates taken at the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light Source synchrotron
beamline, as an illustrative tool for the formulation of our methodology.
Focused at the 700eV Fe LIII and LII photoelectric edges, we discuss a
technique for modeling dust properties in the soft X-rays using L-edge data, to
complement K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure analysis techniques discussed
in Lee & Ravel 2005. This is intended to be *a techniques paper* of interest
and usefulness to both condensed matter experimentalists and astrophysicists.
For the experimentalists, we offer a new prescription for normalizing
relatively low S/N L-edge cross section measurements. For astrophysics
interests, we discuss the use of X-ray absorption spectra for determining dust
composition in cold and ionized astrophysical environments, and a new method
for determining *species-specific gas-to-dust ratios*. Possible astrophysical
applications of interest, are offered. Prospects for improving on this work
with future X-ray missions with higher throughput and spectral resolution are

http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3482v2,Substructure depletion in the Milky Way halo by the disk,"  We employ numerical simulations and simple analytical estimates to argue that
dark matter substructures orbiting in the inner regions of the Galaxy can be
efficiently destroyed by disk shocking, a dynamical process known to affect
globular star clusters. We carry out a set of fiducial high-resolution
collisionless simulations in which we adiabatically grow a disk, allowing us to
examine the impact of the disk on the substructure abundance. We also track the
orbits of dark matter satellites in the high-resolution Aquarius simulations
and analytically estimate the cumulative halo and disk shocking effect. Our
calculations indicate that the presence of a disk with only 10% of the total
Milky Way mass can significantly alter the mass function of substructures in
the inner parts of halos. This has important implications especially for the
relatively small number of satellites seen within ~30 kpc of the Milky Way
center, where disk shocking is expected to reduce the substructure abundance by
a factor of ~2 at 10^9 M$_{\odot}$ and
  ~3 at 10^7 M$_{\odot}$. The most massive subhalos with 10^10
  M$_{\odot}$ survive even in the presence of the disk. This suggests that
there is no inner missing satellite problem, and calls into question whether
these substructures can produce transient features in disks, like multi-armed
spiral patterns. Also, the depletion of dark matter substructures through
shocking on the baryonic structures of the disk and central bulge may aggravate
the problem to fully account for the observed flux anomalies in gravitational
lens systems, and significantly reduces the dark matter annihilation signal
expected from nearby substructures in the inner halo.

microwave sky matched to the most recent astrophysical observations. The
primary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment; however, we have widened the
frequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to
other microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these
simulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated
with the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter
structure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters,
groups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ
signals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination
of cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3% (4%)
of halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20% or more. We
find the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz,
less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<1.2 have
their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20% or more. At 148 GHz, less than
20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<0.8 have their SZ
decrements filled in at a level of 50% or larger. Our models also suggest that
a population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed
sources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90
and 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a
useful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power
spectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.

  Short-Duration GRB 070724A","  [Abridged] We report the discovery of the near-infrared and optical afterglow
of the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB070724A. The afterglow is detected in
i,J,H,K observations starting 2.3 hr after the burst with K=19.59+/-0.16 mag
and i=23.79+/-0.07 mag, but is absent in images obtained 1.3 years later.
Fading is also detected in the K-band between 2.8 and 3.7 hr at a 4-sigma
significance level. The optical/near-IR spectral index, beta_{O,NIR}=-2, is
much redder than expected in the standard afterglow model, pointing to either
significant dust extinction, A_{V,host}~2 mag, or a non-afterglow origin for
the near-IR emission. The case for extinction is supported by a shallow optical
to X-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',
and a normal near-IR to X-ray spectral index. Moreover, a comparison to the
optical discovery magnitudes of all short GRBs with optical afterglows
indicates that the near-IR counterpart of GRB070724A is one of the brightest to
date, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. In the
context of a non-afterglow origin, the near-IR emission may be dominated by a
mini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of M~10^-4 Msun and a
radioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c). However, the
mini-SN model predicts a spectral peak in the UV rather than near-IR,
suggesting that this is either not the correct interpretation or that the
mini-SN models need to be revised. Finally, the afterglow coincides with a star
forming galaxy at z=0.457, previously identified as the host based on its
coincidence with the X-ray afterglow position (~2"" radius). Our discovery of
the optical/near-IR afterglow makes this association secure.

  II. Distribution and origin of warm molecular gas","  The origin and heating mechanisms of warm (50<T<200 K) molecular gas in
low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are strongly debated. Both passive
heating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as well
as active heating by shocks and by UV associated with the outflows or accretion
have been proposed. We aim to characterize the warm gas within protosteller
objects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolar
outflows and the quiescent cloud. High-J CO maps (12CO J=6--5 and 7--6) of the
immediate surroundings (up to 10,000 AU) of eight low-mass YSOs are obtained
with the CHAMP+ 650/850 GHz array receiver mounted on the APEX telescope. In
addition, isotopologue observations of the 13CO J=6--5 transition and [C I]

emission is seen toward all protostars. In the case of HH~46 and Ced 110 IRS 4,
the on-source emission originates in material heated by UV photons scattered in
the outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. Warm
quiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by UV photons from
shocks. Shock-heated warm gas is only detected for Class 0 flows and the more
massive Class I sources such as HH~46. Outflow temperatures, estimated from the
CO 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 K, close to model predictions, with the
exception of the L~1551 IRS 5 and IRAS 12496-7650, for which temperatures <50 K
are found. APEX-CHAMP+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar's

molecular outflow and surrounding cloud, through observations of high

be embedded YSOs. Observations of submillimeter lines of CO, HCO+ and their
isotopologues, both single spectra and small maps were taken with the FLASH and
APEX-2a instruments mounted on APEX to trace the gas around the sources. The
HARP-B instrument on the JCMT was used to map IRAS 15398-3359 in these lines.
HCO+ mapping probes the presence of dense centrally condensed gas, a
characteristic of protostellar envelopes. The rare isotopologues C18O and
H13CO+ are also included to determine the optical depth, column density, and
source velocity. The combination of multiple CO transitions, such as 3-2, 4-3

Archival submillimeter continuum data are used to determine envelope masses.
Eleven of the sixteen sources have associated warm and/or dense quiescent as

strength and degree of concentration of the HCO+ 4-3 and CO 4-3 lines as a
diagnostic, five sources classified as Class I based on their spectral energy

employing a pipelined architecture, FTK is able to continuously operate at
Level-1 rates without deadtime. The system design is defined and studied using

(sub)millimeter emission associated with the supermassive black hole at the
Galactic Center. In the submillimeter regime, Sgr A* exhibits time-variable
linear polarization on timescales corresponding to <10 Schwarzschild radii of
the presumed 4 million solar mass black hole. In previous work, we demonstrated
the potential for total-intensity (sub)millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect
time-variable -- and periodic -- source structure changes in the Sgr A* black
hole system using nonimaging analyses. Here we extend this work to include full
polarimetric VLBI observations. We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter
VLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion
disk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust
against calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization
fraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization
fraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of
changes in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.
The shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization
fraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures
that are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of
periodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly
affected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out. As
more antennas are included in the (sub)mm-VLBI array, observations with full
polarization will provide important new diagnostics to help disentangle
intrinsic source polarization from Faraday rotation effects in the accretion
and outflow region close to the black hole event horizon.

selected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red Spitzer/IRAC colors,
satisfying [3.6]-[4.5] > -0.1 AB mag. Photometric redshifts derived from Subaru
XMM Deep Survey (BViz-bands), UKIRT Infrared Deep Survey-Ultra-Deep Survey
(UKIDSS-UDS, JK-bands), and from the Spitzer Public UDS survey (3.6-8.0 micron)
show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ~ 1.6
that is more than 20 sigma above the mean at this redshift. We obtained optical
spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using IMACS on the
Magellan telescope. We measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the range
z=1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin (<1.4 Mpc) of the astrometric center of the
cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4
sigma) detection in the [0.5-2 keV] band compatible with the expected thermal
emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in
this cluster shows a prominent red-sequence, dominated by a population of red
galaxies with (z-J) > 1.7 mag. The photometric redshift probability
distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z=1.62, coincident
with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U-B) color and

fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic LCDM
initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with
the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically
converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and
their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective
resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved
by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these
methods to the six Milky Way-mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from
halo centre a typical point intersects about 10^14 streams with a very broad
range of individual densities; the ~10^6 most massive streams contribute about
half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution
of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most massive
fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1% of the total signal. Dark matter
particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the Big Bang.
The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie
well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a
negligible boost (<0.1%) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate.
The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10%.
Thus fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the
detectability of dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories, or
indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant
cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most massive local
fine-grained streams because of their extreme localisation in energy/momentum
space. (abridged)

are luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which may

formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies.

luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense
cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are ~100x

underlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similar
to that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anything

short GRBs are cosmological in origin, reside in both star forming and
elliptical galaxies, are not associated with supernovae, and span a wide
isotropic-equivalent energy range of ~10^48-10^52 erg. However, a fundamental
question remains unanswered: What are the progenitors of short GRBs? The most
popular theoretical model invokes the coalescence of compact object binaries
with neutron star and/or black hole constituents. However, additional
possibilities exist, including magnetars formed through prompt channels
(massive star core-collapse) and delayed channels (binary white dwarf mergers,
white dwarf accretion-induced collapse), or accretion-induced collapse of
neutron stars. In this review I summarize our current knowledge of the galactic
and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and use these observations to draw
inferences about the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i)
some short GRBs explode in dead elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short
GRBs occur in star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs
are distinct from those of long GRBs (lower star formation rates, and higher
luminosities and metallicities), and instead appear to be drawn from the
general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs
relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long
GRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution is in good agreement with
predictions for NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) short GRBs trace under-luminous
locations within their hosts, but appear to be more closely correlated with the
rest-frame optical light (old stars) than the UV light (young massive stars).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3041v2,Lyman-alpha Cooling Emission from Galaxy Formation,"  Recent studies have shown that galaxies accrete most of their baryons via the
cold mode, from streams with temperatures T~10^4-10^5 K. At these temperatures,
the streams should radiate primarily in the Lya line and have therefore been
proposed as a model to power the extended, high-redshift objects known as Lya
blobs and other high-redshift Lya sources. We introduce a new Lya radiative
transfer code, aRT, and apply it to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We
address physical and numerical issues that are critical to making accurate
predictions for the cooling luminosity, but that have been mostly neglected or
treated simplistically so far. We highlight the importance of self-shielding
and of properly treating sub-resolution models in simulations. Most existing
simulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead
to order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a
combination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation
techniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the
self-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lya cooling luminosity on
halo mass at z=3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion. While
cooling in massive halos (without additional energy input from star formation
and AGN) is in principle sufficient to produce L_alpha~10^43-10^44 erg s^-1
blobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to
form stars, but which is kept 100% gaseous in our optimistic estimates.
Excluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one
to two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the
observed Lya blobs with pure cooling. Resonant scattering produces diffuse Lya
halos, even for centrally concentrated emission, and broad double peaked line
profiles. [Abridged]

particular, we find that key features of the power spectra can be directly read
off of the nature of the roll path, the curve the field vector rolls along with
respect to the field manifold. For example, models whose roll path makes a
sharp turn 60 e-folds before inflation ends tend to be ruled out because they
produce strong departures from scale invariance. Finally, we apply our
formalism to confront four classes of two-field models with WMAP data,
including doubly quadratic and quartic potentials and non-standard kinetic
terms, showing how whether a model is ruled out depends not only on certain
features of the inflationary Lagrangian, but also on the initial conditions.
Ultimately, models must possess the right balance of kinematical and dynamical
behaviors, which we capture in a set of functions that can be reconstructed
from spectral observables.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4406v2,Intergalactic Dust Extinction in Hydrodynamic Cosmological Simulations,"  Recently Menard et al. detected a subtle but systematic change in the mean
color of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foreground
galaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10Mpc/h, which they interpret
as a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. We present theoretical
models of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a
(50Mpc/h)^3 volume. Our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds and
assumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. The predicted galaxy-dust
correlation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlation
function, and reproducing the MSFR data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of
0.24, about half the value in the Galactic ISM. Roughly half of the reddening
arises in dust that is more than 100Kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. We
also examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smaller
fraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires an
unphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the MSFR data. In both
models, the signal is dominated by sightlines with E(g-i)=0.001-0.1. The
no-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddening
to arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 Msun. The wind model predicts a mean
visual extinction of A_V ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with a
sightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could be
significant for future supernova cosmology studies. Reproducing the MSFR
results in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ISM dust survive
its expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.
Future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure the
dependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for models
of enriched galactic outflows and the survival of IG dust.

  The Methods and Database","  This is the first paper of a series in which we present new measurements of
the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from
the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have obtained 2.3 million
observations of 14,882 sample galaxies over an interval of 11 years (March 1998
through Dec. 2008). We considered 1036 SNe detected in our sample and used an
optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe~Ia, 116 SNe~Ibc, 324 SNe~II) to determine
our SN rates. This is the largest and most homogeneous set of nearby SNe ever
assembled for this purpose, and ours is the first local SN rate analysis based
on CCD imaging and modern image-subtraction techniques. In this paper, we lay
the foundation of the study. We derive the recipe for the control-time
calculation for SNe with a known luminosity function, and provide details on
the construction of the galaxy and SN samples used in the calculations.
Compared with a complete volume-limited galaxy sample, our sample has a deficit
of low-luminosity galaxies but still provides enough statistics for a reliable
rate calculation. There is a strong Malmquist bias, so the average size
(luminosity or mass) of the galaxies increases monotonically with distance, and
this trend is used to showcase a correlation between SN rates and galaxy sizes.
Very few core-collapse SNe are found in early-type galaxies, providing strong
constraints on the amount of recent star formation within these galaxies. The
small average observation interval ($\sim 9$ days) of our survey ensures that
our control-time calculations can tolerate a reasonable amount of uncertainty
in the luminosity functions of SNe. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to
determine the limiting magnitude of each image and the SN detection efficiency
as a function of galaxy Hubble type ... (abridged)

issues that have plagued previous rate calculations for nearby SNe: the
luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a
volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object, and fit
a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve
shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a
Gaussian distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of
different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed
fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find
significant fractions of SNe II-L (10%), IIb (12%), and IIn (9%) in the SN II

  Low-Frequency Dipoles","  The designs of the first generation of cosmological 21-cm observatories are
split between single dipole experiments which integrate over a large patch of
sky in order to find the global (spectral) signature of reionization, and
interferometers with arcminute-scale angular resolution whose goal is to
measure the 3D power spectrum of ionized regions during reionization. We
examine whether intermediate scale instruments with complete Fourier (uv)
coverage are capable of placing new constraints on reionization. We find that
even without using a full power spectrum analysis, the global redshift of
reionization, z_reion, can in principle be measured from the variance in the
21-cm signal among multiple beams as a function of frequency at a roughly 1
degree angular scale. At this scale, the beam-to-beam variance in the
differential brightness temperature peaks when the average neutral fraction was
around 50%, providing a convenient flag of z_reion. We choose a low angular
resolution of order 1 degree to exploit the physical size of the ionized
regions and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Thermal noise, foregrounds, and
instrumental effects should also be manageable at this angular scale, as long
as the uv coverage is complete within the compact core required for
low-resolution imaging. For example, we find that z_reion can potentially be
detected to within a redshift uncertainty of less than around 1 in around 500
hours of integration on the existing MWA prototype (with only 32x16 dipoles),
operating at an angular resolution of around 1 degree and a spectral resolution

  for Short GRBs with Optical Afterglows","  [abridged] We investigate the afterglow properties and large-scale
environments of several short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with
sub-arcsecond optical afterglow positions but no bright coincident host
galaxies. The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility
of significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.
Five such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical
afterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are
systematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst
densities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),
or to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray
fluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale
environments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying
hosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near
each burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence
(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10"",
while somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with
faint galaxies at separations of ~2"". By measuring redshifts for the brighter
galaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of
~30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z>1 leads to offsets of
~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be
explained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two
possibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the
centers of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due
to the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and
have fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts.

Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2007qd, discovered by the SDSS-II Supernova Survey.
It possesses physical properties intermediate to those of the peculiar SN

that it had an extraordinarily fast rise time of <= 10 days and a peak absolute
B magnitude of -15.4 +/- 0.2 at most, making it one of the most subluminous SN
Ia ever observed. Follow-up spectroscopy of SN 2007qd near maximum brightness
unambiguously shows the presence of intermediate-mass elements which are likely
caused by carbon/oxygen nuclear burning. Near maximum brightness, SN 2007qd had
a photospheric velocity of only 2800 km/s, similar to that of SN 2008ha but
about 4000 and 7000 km/s less than that of SN 2002cx and normal SN Ia,

highly correlated with both their light-curve stretch and photospheric

suggests that SN 2007qd is also a pure deflagration of a white dwarf, although
other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. It may be a critical link between SN

perform fully self-consistent GR polarized radiative transfer using our new

angle (PA), accretion rate Mdot, and electron temperature Te (Te is reported
for radius 6M). By fitting the mean sub-mm fluxes and LP/CP fractions, we

diffuse X-ray emission from the cluster has a roughly ellipsoidal shape and
extends out to radii of at least ~60 arcsec (~500 kpc). The centroid of the
diffuse X-ray emission is offset by 0.68(+/-0.11) arcsec (5.5+/-0.9 kpc) from
the position of the quasar. We measure a cluster mass within the radius at
which the mean enclosed density is 2500 times the critical density,
r_2500=283(+18/-13)kpc, of 1.02 (+0.21/-0.14)x10^14 M_sun. The gas mass
fraction within this radius is f_gas=0.129(+0.015/-0.016). This value is
consistent with measurements at lower redshifts and implies minimal evolution
in the f_gas(z) relation for hot, massive clusters at 0<z<1.1. The measured
metal abundance of 0.42(+0.08/-0.07) Solar is consistent with the abundance
observed in other massive, high redshift clusters. The spatially-resolved
temperature profile for the cluster shows a drop in temperature, from kT~8 keV
to kT~3 keV, in its central regions that is characteristic of cooling core
clusters. This is the first spectroscopic identification of a cooling core

can supply enough fuel to support the growth of the supermassive black hole and
to power the luminous quasar. The radiative power of the quasar exceeds by a
factor of 10 the kinematic power of the central radio source, suggesting that

  simulations of gas rich galaxies","  We study the evolution of gravitationally recoiled supermassive black holes
(BHs) in massive gas-rich galaxies by means of high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations. We find that the presence of a massive gaseous disc allows
recoiled BHs to return to the centre on a much shorter timescale than for
purely stellar discs. Also, BH accretion and feedback can strongly modify the
orbit of recoiled BHs and hence their return timescale, besides affecting the
distribution of gas and stars in the galactic centre. However, the dynamical
interaction of kicked BHs with the surrounding medium is in general complex and
can facilitate both a fast return to the centre as well as a significant delay.
The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rates of the recoiling BHs in our simulated
galaxies are favourably high for the detection of off-centred AGN if kicked
within gas-rich discs -- up to a few per cent of the Eddington accretion rate
-- and are highly variable on timescales of a few 10^7 yrs. In major merger
simulations of gas-rich galaxies, we find that gravitational recoils increase
the scatter in the BH mass -- host galaxy relationships compared to simulations
without kicks, with the BH mass being more sensitive to recoil kicks than the
bulge mass. A generic result of our numerical models is that the clumpy massive
discs suggested by recent high-redshift observations, as well as the remnants
of gas-rich mergers, exhibit a gravitational potential that falls steeply in
the central regions, due to the dissipative concentration of baryons. As a
result, supermassive BHs should only rarely be able to escape from massive
galaxies at high redshifts, which is the epoch where the bulk of BH recoils is
expected to occur.[Abridged]

condensation of planet-mass H-4He gas clouds in trillion-planet clumps is set
at 300,000 yr (0.3My) following the onset of plasma instabilities when ambient
temperatures were >1000K. Eventual collapse of the planet-cloud into a solid
structure takes place against the background of an expanding universe with
declining ambient temperatures. Stars form from planet mergers within the
clumps and die by supernovae on overeating of planets. For planets produced by
stars, isothermal free fall collapse occurs initially via quasi equilibrium
polytropes until opacity sets in due to molecule and dust formation. The
contracting cooling cloud is a venue for molecule formation and the sequential
condensation of solid particles, starting from mineral grains at high
temperatures to ice particles at lower temperatures, water-ice becomes
thermodynamically stable between 7 and 15 My after the initial onset of
collapse, and contraction to form a solid icy core begins shortly thereafter.
Primordial-clump-planets are separated by ~ 1000 AU, reflecting the high
density of the universe at 30,000 yr. Exchanges of materials, organic molecules
and evolving templates readily occur, providing optimal conditions for an
initial origin of life in hot primordial gas planet water cores when adequately
fertilized by stardust. The condensation of solid molecular hydrogen as an
extended outer crust takes place much later in the collapse history of the

the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds the saturation vapour pressure of solid
hydrogen at the ambient temperature and condensation occurs.

galaxies, aimed at measuring their stellar masses and population ages. The
goals of this study are to evaluate whether short GRBs track the stellar mass
distribution of galaxies, to investigate the progenitor delay time
distribution, and to explore any connection between long and short GRB
progenitors. Using single stellar population models we infer masses of
log(M/M_sun)=8.8-11.6 and population ages of tau=0.03-4.4 Gyr. We further infer
maximal masses of log(M/M_sun)=9.7-11.9 by assuming stellar population ages
equal to the age of the universe at each host's redshift. Comparing the
distribution of stellar masses to the general galaxy mass function we find that
short GRBs track the cosmic stellar mass distribution only if the late-type
hosts generally have maximal masses. However, there is an apparent dearth of
early-type hosts compared to the equal contribution of early- and late-type
galaxies to the cosmic stellar mass budget. These results suggest that stellar
mass may not be the sole parameter controlling the short GRB rate, and raise
the possibility of a two-component model with both mass and star formation
playing a role. If short GRBs in late-type galaxies indeed track the star
formation activity, the resulting typical delay time is ~0.2 Gyr, while those
in early-type hosts have a typical delay of ~3 Gyr. Using the same stellar
population models we fit the data for 22 long GRB hosts and find that they have
lower masses and younger population ages, with <log(M/M_sun)>=9.1 and
<tau>=0.06 Gyr, respectively; their maximal masses are similarly lower,
<log(M/M_sun)>=9.6. Most importantly, the two host populations remain distinct
even if we consider only the star-forming hosts of short GRBs, supporting our
previous findings that the progenitors of long GRBs and short GRBs in late-type
galaxies are distinct.

properties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as CIV
1549. Specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between L_UV and
emission line EQW (the Baldwin Effect) and the ""blueshifting"" of
high-ionization emission lines. The blueshift of the CIV emission line is
nearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (RQ) quasars
and 360 km/s for radio-loud (RL) quasars, and the Baldwin Effect is present in
both RQ and RL samples. Composite spectra are constructed as a function of CIV
emission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships between
different line species and the SED. Within a two-component disk+wind model of
the broad emission line region (BELR), where the wind filters the continuum
seen by the disk component, we find that RL quasars are consistent with being
dominated by the disk component, while BALQSOs are consistent with being
dominated by the wind component. Some RQ objects have emission line features
similar to RL quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (BH) spin
to form radio jets. Our results suggest that there could be significant
systematic errors in the determination of L_bol and BH mass that make it
difficult to place these findings in a more physical context. However, it is
possible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of BELR
parameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars
(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the SED, which
ultimately must be tied to BH mass and accretion rate.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2770v1,"Evidence for Low Black Hole Spin and Physically Motivated Accretion
  Models from Millimeter VLBI Observations of Sagittarius A*","  Millimeter very-long baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides the novel
capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive black holes
on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the
immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. (2009) have already shown
that by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion
theory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black
hole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes.
Here we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a
class of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find
that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux
distribution at the 3.9-sigma level, strongly favoring length-to-width ratios
of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically motivated accretion
flow models provide a significantly better fit to the mm-VLBI observations than
phenomenological models, at the 2.9-sigma level. This implies that not only is
mm-VLBI presently capable of distinguishing between potential physical models
for Sgr A*'s emission, but further that it is sensitive to the strong
gravitational lensing associated with the propagation of photons near the black
hole. Based upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude,
viewing angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are
a=0.0(+0.64+0.86), theta=68(+5+9)(-20-28) degrees, and xi=-52(+17+33)(-15-24)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4959v2,The First Systematic Study of Type Ibc Supernova Multi-band Light Curves,"  We present detailed optical photometry for 25 Type Ibc supernovae within
d\approx150 Mpc obtained with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope in
2004-2007. This study represents the first uniform, systematic, and statistical
sample of multi-band SNe Ibc light curves available to date. We correct the
light curves for host galaxy extinction using a new technique based on the
photometric color evolution, namely, we show that the (V-R) color of
extinction-corrected SNe Ibc at t\approx10 days after V-band maximum is tightly
distributed, (V-R)=0.26+-0.06 mag. Using this technique, we find that SNe Ibc
typically suffer from significant host galaxy extinction, E(B-V)\approx0.4 mag.
A comparison of the extinction-corrected light curves for SNe Ib and Ic reveals
that they are statistically indistinguishable, both in luminosity and decline
rate. We report peak absolute magnitudes of M_R=-17.9+-0.9 mag and
M_R=-18.3+-0.6 mag for SNe Ib and Ic, respectively. Focusing on the broad-lined
SNe Ic, we find that they are more luminous than the normal SNe Ibc sample,
M_R=-19.0+-1.1 mag, with a probability of only 1.6% that they are drawn from
the same population of explosions. By comparing the peak absolute magnitudes of
SNe Ic-BL with those inferred for local engine-driven explosions (GRB-SN
1998bw, XRF-SN 2006aj, and SN2009bb) we find a 25% probability that they are
drawn from the SNe Ic-BL population. Finally, we fit analytic models to the
light-curves to derive typical Ni-56 masses of M_Ni \approx0.2 and 0.5 M_sun
for SNe Ibc and SNe Ic-BL, respectively. With reasonable assumptions for the
photospheric velocities, we extract kinetic energy and ejecta mass values of
M_ej \approx 2 M_sun and E_K\approx1e+51 erg for SNe Ibc, while for SNe Ic-BL
we find higher values, M_ej\approx5 M_sun and E_K\approx1e+52 erg. We discuss
the implications for the progenitors of SNe Ibc and their relation to
engine-driven explosions [ABRIDGED].

http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1967v1,Rotation periods for very low mass stars in Praesepe,"  We investigate the rotation periods of fully convective very low mass stars
(VLM, M<0.3 Msol), with the aim to derive empirical constraints for the
spindown due to magnetically driven stellar winds. Our analysis is based on a
new sample of rotation periods in the main-sequence cluster Praesepe (age 600
Myr). From photometric lightcurves obtained with the Isaac Newton Telescope, we
measure rotation periods for 49 objects, among them 26 in the VLM domain. This
enlarges the period sample in this mass and age regime by a factor of 6. Almost
all VLM objects in our sample are fast rotators with periods <2.5 d, in
contrast to the stars with M>0.6 Msol in this cluster which have periods of
7-14 d. Thus, we confirm that the period-mass distribution in Praesepe exhibits
a radical break at M~0.3-0.6 Msol. Our data indicate a positive period-mass
trend in the VLM regime, similar to younger clusters. In addition, the scatter
of the periods increases with mass. For the M>0.3 Msol objects in our sample
the period distribution is probably affected by binarity. By comparing the
Praesepe periods with literature samples in the cluster NGC2516 (age ~150 Myr)
we constrain the spindown in the VLM regime. An exponential rotational braking
law P ~ exp(t/tau) with a mass-dependent tau is required to reproduce the data.
The spindown timescale tau increases steeply towards lower masses; we derive
tau~0.5 Gyr for 0.3 Msol and >1 Gyr for 0.1 Msol. These constraints are
consistent with the current paradigm of the spindown due to wind braking. We
discuss possible physical origins of this behaviour and prospects for future
work.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4345v1,"Rotational Variability of Earth's Polar Regions: Implications for
  Detecting Snowball Planets","  We have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations of
Earth's poles with the Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI Mission of
Opportunity. These data mimic what we will see when we point next-generation
space telescopes at nearby exoplanets. We use principal component analysis
(PCA) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneities
and map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as a
complement to the equatorial views presented in Cowan et al. (2009). We also
perform the same PCA on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurves
from NASA's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model. This
numerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA
can robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar
broadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent
albedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to
mid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes
emphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the
mid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at
short wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor
in the south polar observation. We construct a simple reflectance model for a
snowball Earth. By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the
modern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not
noticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short
wavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in
those wavebands. Thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal color
variations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-day
Earth, regardless of viewing angle.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0776v2,The cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray background from dark matter annihilation,"  (Abridged) The extragalactic background light (EBL) observed at multiple
wavelengths is a promising tool to probe the nature of dark matter since it
might contain a significant contribution from gamma-rays produced promptly by
dark matter annihilation. Additionally, the electrons and positrons produced in
the annihilation give energy to the CMB photons to populate the EBL with X-rays
and gamma-rays. We here create full-sky maps of the radiation from both of
these contributions using the high-resolution Millennium-II simulation. We use
upper limits on the contributions of unknown sources to the EBL to constrain
the intrinsic properties of dark matter using a model-independent approach that
can be employed as a template to test different particle physics models
(including those with a Sommerfeld enhancement). These upper limits are based
on observations spanning eight orders of magnitude in energy (from soft X-rays
measured by CHANDRA to gamma-rays measured by Fermi), and on expectations for
the contributions from blazars and star forming galaxies. To exemplify this
approach, we analyze a set of benchmark Sommerfeld-enhanced models that give
the correct dark matter abundance, satisfy CMB constraints, and fit the cosmic
ray spectra measured by PAMELA and Fermi without any contribution from local
subhalos. We find that these models are in conflict with the EBL constraints
unless the contribution of unresolved subhalos is small and the annihilation
signal dominates the EBL. We conclude that provided the collisionless cold dark
matter paradigm is accurate, even for conservative estimates of the
contribution from unresolved subhalos and astrophysical backgrounds, the EBL is
at least as sensitive a probe of these types of scenarios as the CMB. Our
results disfavor an explanation of the positron excess measured by PAMELA based
only on dark matter annihilation in the smooth Galactic halo.

  Space Telescope and Wide Field Camera 3","  We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope to
determine the Hubble constant (H0) from optical and infrared observations of
over 600 Cepheid variables in the host galaxies of 8 recent Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia), providing the calibration for a mag-z relation of 253 SNe Ia.
Increased precision over past measurements comes from: (1) more than doubling
the number of infrared observations of Cepheids in nearby SN hosts; (2)
increasing the sample of ideal SN Ia calibrators from six to eight; (3)
increasing by 20% the number of Cepheids with infrared observations in the
megamaser host NGC 4258; (4) reducing the difference in the mean metallicity of
the Cepheid comparison samples from \Delta log [O/H] = 0.08 to 0.05; and (5)
calibrating all optical Cepheid colors with one camera, WFC3, to remove
cross-instrument zero-point errors. Uncertainty in H0 from beyond the 1st rung
of the distance ladder is reduced from 3.5% to 2.3%. The measurement of H0 via
the geometric distance to NGC 4258 is 74.8 \pm 3.1 km s- 1 Mpc-1, a 4.1%
measurement including systematics. Better precision independent of NGC 4258
comes from two alternative Cepheid absolute calibrations: (1) 13 Milky Way
Cepheids with parallaxes and (2) 92 Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud with
multiple eclipsing binary distances, yielding 74.4 \pm 2.5 km s- 1 Mpc-1, a
3.4% uncertainty with systematics. Our best estimate uses all three
calibrations but a larger uncertainty afforded from any two: H0 = 73.8 \pm 2.4
km s- 1 Mpc-1 including systematics, a 3.3% uncertainty. The improvement in H0,
combined with WMAP7yr data, results in a constraint on the EOS parameter of
dark energy of w = -1.08 \pm 0.10 and Neff = 4.2 \pm 0.7 for the number of
relativistic species in the early universe. It also rules out the best-fitting
gigaparsec-scale void models, posited as an alternative to dark energy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3597v1,Kinematics of Gas in Lyman Alpha Nebulae,"  Exploring the origin of Ly-alpha nebulae (blobs) requires measurements of
their gas kinematics that are impossible with only the resonant,
optically-thick LyA line. To define gas motions relative to the systemic
velocity of the blob, the LyA line must be compared with an optically-thin line
like Halpha, which is not much altered by radiative transfer effects. We obtain
optical and NIR spectra of the two brightest LyA blobs from Yang et al. sample
using the Magellan/MagE and VLT/SINFONI. Both the LyA and Halpha lines confirm
that these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. Within each blob, we detect
several Halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in HST
images. The Halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internal
velocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (LAB01), their
velocity difference is ~440 km/s. The presence of multiple galaxies within the
blobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relative
motion, is consistent with our previous finding that LyA blobs inhabit massive
dark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.
To determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly
infalling or outflowing, we compare the LyA and Halpha line centers, finding
that LyA is not offset (Delta LyA = +0km/s) in LAB01 and redshifted by only
+230 km/s in LAB02. These offsets are small compared to those of Lyman break
galaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. We test and
rule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models with
super/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. Because of the
unknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiple
sources of LyA emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and more
sophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range of
infall and outflow scenarios.

models of reionization based on the initial density field of the Aquarius
parent simulation, Millennium-II, to study the impact of patchy reionization on
the faint satellite population of Milky Way halos. Because the Aquarius suite
consists of zoom-in simulations of halos in the Millennium-II volume, we follow
the formation of substructure and the growth of reionization bubbles due to the
larger environment simultaneously, and thereby determine the reionization
redshifts of satellite candidates. We do this for four different reionization
models, and also compare results to instantaneous reionization. Using a simple
procedure for selecting satellites and assigning luminosities in the
simulations, we compare the resulting satellite populations. We find that the
overall number of satellites depends sensitively on the reionization model,
with a factor of 3-4 variation between the four models for a given host halo,
although the difference is entirely in the population of faint satellites (M_V
> -10). In addition, we find that for a given reionization model the total
number of satellites differs by 10%-20% between the patchy and homogeneous
scenarios, provided that the redshift is chosen appropriately for the
instantaneous case. However, the halo-halo scatter from the six Aquarius halos
is large, up to a factor of 2-3, and so is comparable to the difference between
reionization scenarios. In order to use the population of faint dwarf galaxies
around the Milky Way as a probe of the local reionization history, then, it is
necessary to first better understand the general distribution of substructure
around Milky Way-mass halos.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1281v2,Moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics,"  We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation using
the new moving mesh code AREPO and compare the results with GADGET simulations
based on a traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The two
codes share the same Tree-PM gravity solver and include identical
sub-resolution physics, but employ different methods to solve the equations of
hydrodynamics. This allows us to assess the impact of hydro-solver
uncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. We
focus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic star
formation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numerical
methods. Properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by Keres et
al. (2011), while a third paper by Sijacki et al. (2011) uses idealised
simulations to analyse the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. We
find that the global baryon statistics differ significantly between the two
simulation approaches. AREPO shows higher star formation rates at late times,
lower mean temperatures, and different gas mass fractions in characteristic
phases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas.
Although both codes use the same implementation of cooling, more gas cools out
of haloes in AREPO compared with GADGET towards low redshifts. We show that
this is caused by a higher heating rate with SPH in the outer parts of haloes,
owing to viscous dissipation of SPH's inherent sonic velocity noise and SPH's
efficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region,
and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in AREPO. As a result of
such differences, AREPO leads also to more disk-like morphologies compared to
GADGET. Our results indicate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can lead
to comparatively large systematic differences.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1831v1,CO and H2 Absorption in the AA Tauri Circumstellar Disk,"  The direct study of molecular gas in inner protoplanetary disks is
complicated by uncertainties in the spatial distribution of the gas, the
time-variability of the source, and the comparison of observations across a
wide range of wavelengths. Some of these challenges can be mitigated with
far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. Using new observations obtained with the
HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, we measure column densities and rovibrational
temperatures for CO and H2 observed on the line-of-sight through the AA Tauri
circumstellar disk. CO A-X absorption bands are observed against the far-UV
continuum. The CO absorption is characterized by log(N(^{12}CO)) = 17.5 +/- 0.5
cm^{-2} and T_rot(CO) = 500$^{+500}_{-200} K, although this rotational
temperature may underestimate the local kinetic temperature of the CO-bearing
gas. We also detect ^{13}CO in absorption with an isotopic ratio of ~20. We do
not observe H2 absorption against the continuum; however, hot H2 (v > 0) is
detected in absorption against the LyA emission line. We measure the column
densities in eight individual rovibrational states, determining a total
log(N(H2)) = 17.9^{+0.6}_{-0.3} cm^{-2} with a thermal temperature of T(H2) =
2500^{+800}_{-700} K. The high-temperature of the molecules, the relatively
small H2 column density, and the high-inclination of the AA Tauri disk suggest
that the absorbing gas resides in an inner disk atmosphere. If the H2 and CO
are co-spatial within a molecular layer ~ 0.6 AU thick, this region is
characterized by <n_H2> ~ 10^{5} cm^{-3} with an observed <CO/H2> ratio of ~
0.4. We also find evidence for a departure from a purely thermal H2
distribution, suggesting that excitation by continuum photons and H2 formation
may be altering the level populations in the molecular gas.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3468v2,Moving mesh cosmology: the hydrodynamics of galaxy formation,"  We present a detailed comparison between the well-known SPH code GADGET and
the new moving-mesh code AREPO on a number of hydrodynamical test problems.
Through a variety of numerical experiments we establish a clear link between
test problems and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in
several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in
idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation
setups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting gas properties in the full
cosmological framework, as highlighted in papers by Vogelsberger et al. (2011)
and Keres et al. (2011). We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid
instabilities in GADGET suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates
vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from
infalling substructures. In idealized tests of inside-out disk formation, the
convergence rate of gas disk sizes is much slower in GADGET due to spurious
angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction
between a forming central disk and orbiting substructures in a halo, the final
disk morphology is strikingly different. In AREPO, gas from infalling
substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo
atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disk. Conversely,
gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in GADGET simulations, morphologically
transforming the disk as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH
solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably
affect cosmological simulations due to their hierarchical nature. Our numerical
experiments clearly demonstrate that AREPO delivers a physically more reliable
solution.

high-resolution gravity solver. We are thus able to compare both simulation
sets on an object-by-object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact of
different hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. In accompanying
papers, we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted by
the simulation codes, (Vogelsberger et al. 2011) and complementary idealized
simulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes
(Sijacki et al. 2011). Here we investigate their influence on the baryonic
properties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. We find that
AREPO leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies in
massive haloes and to more extended gaseous disks in galaxies, which also
feature a thinner and smoother morphology than their GADGET counterparts.
Consequently, galaxies formed in AREPO have larger sizes and higher specific
angular momentum than their SPH correspondents. The more efficient cooling
flows in AREPO yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centers (and
the opposite trend in halo outskirts) leading to higher star formation rates of
massive galaxies. While both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number of
baryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results clearly demonstrate that
galaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accurate
hydrodynamical techniques such as AREPO.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6265v2,"On the Correlations between Galaxy Properties and Supermassive Black
  Hole Mass","  We use a large sample of upper limits and accurate estimates of supermassive
black holes masses coupled with libraries of host galaxy velocity dispersions,
rotational velocities and photometric parameters extracted from Sloan Digital
Sky Survey i-band images to establish correlations between the SMBH and host
galaxy parameters. We test whether the mass of the black hole, MBH, is
fundamentally driven by either local or global galaxy properties. We explore
correlations between MBH and stellar velocity dispersion sigma, bulge
luminosity, bulge mass Sersic index, bulge mean effective surface brightness,
luminosity of the galaxy, galaxy stellar mass, maximum circular velocity Vc,
galaxy dynamical and effective masses. We verify the tightness of the MBH-sigma
relation and find that correlations with other galaxy parameters do not yield
tighter trends. We do not find differences in the MBH-sigma relation of barred
and unbarred galaxies. The MBH-sigma relation of pseudo-bulges is also coarser
and has a different slope than that involving classical bulges. The MBH-bulge
mass is not as tight as the MBH-sigma relation, despite the bulge mass proving
to be a better proxy of MBH than bulge luminosity. We find a rather poor
correlation between MBH and Sersic index suggesting that MBH is not related to
the bulge light concentration. The correlations between MBH and galaxy
luminosity or mass are not a marked improvement over the MBH sigma relation. If
Vc is a proxy for the dark matter halo mass, the large scatter of the MBH-Vc
relation then suggests that MBH is more coupled to the baryonic rather than the
dark matter. We have tested the need for a third parameter in the MBH scaling
relations, through various linear correlations with bulge and galaxy
parameters, only to confirm that the fundamental plane of the SMBH is mainly
driven by sigma, with a small tilt due to the effective radius. (Abridged)

  Applications to the Star Formation Law","  The most common means of converting an observed CO line intensity into a
molecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (Xco). While in the
Milky Way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is good
reason to believe that Xco will depend on the larger-scale galactic
environment. Utilising numerical models, we investigate how varying
metallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impact the
way CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under what
circumstances Xco may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due to
the combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, Xco
is depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments such
as ULIRGs. In contrast, in low metallicity environments, Xco tends to be higher
than in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal-poor clouds. At
higher redshifts, gas-rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps which
are warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocity
dispersions. These discs tend to have Xco values ranging between present-epoch
gas-rich mergers and quiescent discs at low-z. This model shows that on
average, mergers do have lower Xco values than disc galaxies, though there is
significant overlap. Xco varies smoothly with the local conditions within a
galaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine our
results to provide a general fitting formula for Xco as a function of CO line
intensity and metallicity. We show that replacing the traditional approach of
using one constant Xco for starbursts and another for discs with our best-fit
function produces star formation laws that are continuous rather than bimodal,
and that have significantly reduced scatter.

  Eridani (2009)","  Context. Nova Eridani (2009) caught the eye of the nova community due to its
fast decline from maximum, which was initially missed, and its subsequent
development in the radio and X-ray wavelengths. This system also exhibits
properties similar to those of the much smaller class of recurrent novae;
themselves potential progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae. Aims. We aim to
determine the nature and physical parameters of the KT Eri progenitor system.
Methods. We searched the Harvard College Observatory archive plates for the
progenitor of KT Eri to determine the nature of the system, particularly the
evolutionary stage of the secondary.We used the data obtained to search for any
periodic signal and the derived luminosity to estimate a recurrence timescale.
Furthermore, by comparing the colours of the quiescent system on a
colour-magnitude diagram we may infer the nature of the secondary star.
Results. We identified the progenitor system of KT Eri and measured a quiescent
magnitude of < B >= 14.7 \pm 0.4. No previous outburst was found. However, we
suggest that if the nova is recurrent it should be on a timescale of centuries.
We find a periodicity at quiescence of 737 days which may arise from reflection
effects and/or eclipses in the central binary. The periodicity and the
quiescence magnitude of the system suggest that the secondary star is evolved
and likely in, or ascending, the Red Giant Branch. A second period is evident
at 376 days which has a sinusoidal like light curve. Furthermore, the outburst
amplitude of ~ 9 magnitudes is inconsistent with those expected for fast
classical novae (~ 17 magnitudes) which may lend further support for an evolved
secondary. (Abridged)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5635v2,Moving Mesh Cosmology: Properties of Gas Disks,"  We compare the structural properties of galaxies formed in cosmological
simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET with
those using the moving-mesh code AREPO. Both codes employ identical gravity
solvers and the same sub-resolution physics but use very different methods to
track the hydrodynamic evolution of gas. This permits us to isolate the effects
of the hydro solver on the formation and evolution of galactic gas disks in
GADGET and AREPO haloes with comparable numerical resolution. In a matching
sample of GADGET and AREPO haloes we fit simulated gas disks with exponential
profiles. We find that the cold gas disks formed using the moving mesh approach
have systematically larger disk scale lengths and higher specific angular
momenta than their GADGET counterparts across a wide range in halo masses. For
low mass galaxies differences between the properties of the simulated galaxy
disks are caused by an insufficient number of resolution elements which lead to
the artificial angular momentum transfer in our SPH calculation. We however
find that galactic disks formed in massive halos, resolved with 10^6
particles/cells, are still systematically smaller in the GADGET run by a factor
of ~2. The reasons for this are: 1) The excessive heating of haloes close to
the cooling radius due to spurious dissipation of the subsonic turbulence in
GADGET; and 2) The efficient delivery of low angular momentum gaseous blobs to
the bottom of the potential well. While this large population of gaseous blobs
in GADGET originates from the filaments which are pressure confined and
fragment due to the SPH surface tension while infalling into hot halo
atmospheres, it is essentially absent in the moving mesh calculation, clearly
indicating numerical rather than physical origin of the blob material.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2877v2,The X-ray Counterpart of the High-B Pulsar PSR J0726-2612,"  Middle-aged, cooling neutron stars are observed both as relatively rapidly
spinning radio pulsars and as more slowly spinning, strongly magnetized
isolated neutron stars (INSs), which stand out by their thermal X-ray spectra.
The difference between the two classes may be that the INSs initially had much
stronger magnetic fields, which decayed. To test this, we used the Chandra
X-ray Observatory to observe 1RXS J072559.8-261229, a possible X-ray
counterpart to PSR J0726-2612, which, with its 3.44s period and 3e13G inferred
magnetic field strength, is the nearest and least extincted among the possible
slowly-spinning, strong-field INS progenitors (it likely is in the Gould Belt,
at ~1 kpc). We confirm the identification and find that the pulsar has a
spectrum consistent with being purely thermal, with blackbody temperature
kT=87+/-5 eV and radius R=5.7+2.6-1.3 km at a distance of 1 kpc. We detect
sinusoidal pulsations at twice the radio period with a semi-amplitude of
27\pm5%. The properties of PSR J0726-2612 strongly resemble those of the INSs,
except for its much shorter characteristic age of 200 kyr (instead of several
Myr). We conclude that PSR J0726-2612 is indeed an example of a young INS, one
that started with a magnetic field strength on the low end of those inferred
for the INSs, and that, therefore, decayed by a relatively small amount. Our
results suggest that the long-period, strong-field pulsars and the INSs are
members of the same class, and open up new opportunities to understand the
puzzling X-ray and optical emission of the INSs through radio observations of
PSR J0726-2612.

rotational velocities derived from HI line widths. We compare the data products
provided through the SDSS imaging pipeline with our own photometry of the SDSS
images, and use the velocities (V) as an independent metric to determine ideal
galaxy sizes (R) and luminosities (L). Our radial and luminosity parameters
improve upon the SDSS DR7 Petrosian radii and luminosities through the use of
isophotal fits to the galaxy images. This improvement is gauged via VL and RV
relations whose respective scatters are reduced by ~8% and ~30% compared to
similar relations built with SDSS parameters. The tightest VRL relations are
obtained with the i-band radius, R235i, measured at 23.5 mag/arcsec^-2, and the
luminosity L235i, measured within R235i. Our VRL scaling relations compare
well, both in scatter and slope, with similar studies (such comparisons however
depend sensitively on the nature and size of the compared samples). The typical
slopes, b, and observed scatters, sigma, of the i-band VL, RL and RV relations

also compute scaling relations in terms of the baryonic mass (stars + gas),

fundamental, than other VL relations of spiral galaxies.

high-resolution spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma).

on their mass profiles, we have carried out (gravity-only) simulations of the
concordance LCDM cosmology, covering a mass range of 2.10^{12}-2.10^{15} solar
mass/h and a redshift range of z=0-2, while satisfying the associated
requirements of resolution and statistical control. When fitting to the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our concentration-mass (c-M) relation differs in
normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited
statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of
the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a
function of the peak height parameter, \nu. Unlike the c-M relation, the slope
of the c-\nu relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z=0-2,
while the amplitude varies by ~30% for massive clusters. This relation is,
however, not universal: Using a simulation suite covering the allowed wCDM
parameter space, we show that the c-\nu relation varies by about +/- 20% as
cosmological parameters are varied. At fixed mass, the c(M) distribution is
well-fit by a Gaussian with \sigma_c/c = 0.33, independent of the radius at
which the concentration is defined, the halo dynamical state, and the
underlying cosmology. We compare the LCDM predictions with observations of halo
concentrations from strong lensing, weak lensing, galaxy kinematics, and X-ray

but with some disagreements at lower masses. Because of uncertainty in
observational systematics and modeling of baryonic physics, the significance of
these discrepancies remains unclear.

shocks driven by the expanding radio source, we estimated the corresponding

under-pressured with respect to the cold optical-line emitting gas and

  clusters of the Fornax dSph","  Recently, high-dispersion spectroscopy has demonstrated conclusively that
four of the five globular clusters (GCs) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy
are very metal-poor with [Fe/H]<-2. The remaining cluster, Fornax 4, has
[Fe/H]=-1.4. This is in stark contrast to the field star metallicity
distribution which shows a broad peak around [Fe/H]=-1 with only a few percent
of the stars having [Fe/H]<-2. If we only consider stars and clusters with
[Fe/H]<-2 we thus find an extremely high GC specific frequency, SN=400,
implying by far the highest ratio of GCs to field stars known anywhere. We
estimate that about 1/5-1/4 of all stars in the Fornax dSph with [Fe/H]<-2
belong to the four most metal-poor GCs. These GCs could, therefore, at most
have been a factor of 4-5 more massive initially. Yet, the Fornax GCs appear to
share the same anomalous chemical abundance patterns known from Milky Way GCs,
commonly attributed to the presence of multiple stellar generations within the
clusters. The extreme ratio of metal-poor GC- versus field stars in the Fornax
dSph is difficult to reconcile with scenarios for self-enrichment and early
evolution of GCs in which a large fraction (90%-95%) of the first-generation
stars have been lost. It also suggests that the GCs may not have formed as part
of a larger population of now disrupted clusters with an initial power-law mass
distribution. The Fornax dSph may be a rosetta stone for constraining theories
of the formation, self-enrichment and early dynamical evolution of star
clusters.

spectral type F,G,K, and M, based on 29000 spectra taken with the Keck I
telescope. We also present 131 FGKM standard stars, all of which exhibit
constant radial velocity for at least 10 years, with an RMS less than 0.03
km/s. All velocities are measured relative to the solar system barycenter.
Spectra of the Sun and of asteroids pin the zero-point of our velocities,
yielding a velocity accuracy of 0.01 km/s for G2V stars. This velocity
zero-point agrees within 0.01 \kms with the zero-points carefully determined by
Nidever et al. (2002) and Latham et al. (2002). For reference we compute the
differences in velocity zero-points between our velocities and standard stars
of the IAU, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and l'Observatoire
de Geneve, finding agreement with all of them at the level of 0.1 km/s. But our
radial velocities (and those of all other groups) contain no corrections for
convective blueshift or gravitational redshifts (except for G2V stars), leaving
them vulnerable to systematic errors of 0.2 \kms for K dwarfs and ~0.3 km/s for
M dwarfs due to subphotospheric convection, for which we offer velocity
corrections. The velocities here thus represent accurately the radial component
of each star's velocity vector. The radial velocity standards presented here
are designed to be useful as fundamental standards in astronomy. They may be
useful for Gaia (Crifo et al. 2010, Gilmore et al. 2012} and for dynamical
studies of such systems as long-period binary stars, star clusters, Galactic
structure, and nearby galaxies, as will be carried out by SDSS, RAVE, APOGEE,

http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0006v3,"Constraining the Galactic potential via action-based distribution
  functions for mono-abundance stellar populations","  We present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the Galactic
potential based on the phase-space information for many individual stars. Such
an approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic
surveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes the orbit
distribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)
proposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these
parametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space
distributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars
(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which
enables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic
mono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to
constrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint
likelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over
the DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection
function inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the
uncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,
we study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be
reached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By
creating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and
realistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitational
potential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with
sample sizes of a few thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that
are smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitations
in our current study.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2913v3,A model for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation physics,"  We present a new comprehensive model of the physics of galaxy formation
designed for large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation
using the moving mesh code AREPO. Our model includes primordial and metal line
cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution and feedback
processes, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, a novel subgrid model for the
metal loading of outflows, black hole (BH) seeding, BH growth and merging
procedures, quasar- and radio-mode feedback, and a prescription for radiative
electro-magnetic (EM) feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The metal
mass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind mass
loading. This is required to simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content
of low mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. Radiative EM AGN feedback
is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a
luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback
suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode
feedback alone, but is less efficient than mechanical radio-mode feedback in
regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions
for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations. Our
best match model reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation
history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass - halo mass relation, g-,
r-, i-, z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher relation.
We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and
AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low and
high mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to
be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient
cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.

Class 0 protostar L1527 IRS (IRAS 04368+2557) at 870 micron and 3.4 mm from the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Combined Array for Research in Millimeter
Astronomy (CARMA). We detect the signature of an edge-on disk surrounding the
protostar with an observed diameter of 180 AU in the sub/millimeter images. The
mass of the disk is estimated to be 0.007 M_sun, assuming optically thin,
isothermal dust emission. The millimeter spectral index is observed to be quite
shallow at all the spatial scales probed; alpha ~ 2, implying a dust opacity
spectral index beta ~ 0. We model the emission from the disk and surrounding
envelope using Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes, simultaneously fitting the
sub/millimeter visibility amplitudes, sub/millimeter images, resolved L\arcmin\
image, spectral energy distribution, and mid-infrared spectrum. The best
fitting model has a disk radius of R = 125 AU, is highly flared (H ~ R^1.3),
has a radial density profile rho ~ R^-2.5, and has a mass of 0.0075 M_sun. The
scale height at 100 AU is 48 AU, about a factor of two greater than vertical
hydrostatic equilibrium. The resolved millimeter observations indicate that
disks may grow rapidly throughout the Class 0 phase. The mass and radius of the
young disk around L1527 is comparable to disks around pre-main sequence stars;
however, the disk is considerably more vertically extended, possibly due to a
combination of lower protostellar mass, infall onto the disk upper layers, and
little settling of ~1 micron-sized dust grains.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4184v1,"Searching for Cooling Signatures in Strong Lensing Galaxy Clusters:
  Evidence Against Baryons Shaping the Matter Distribution in Cluster Cores","  The process by which the mass density profile of certain galaxy clusters
becomes centrally concentrated enough to produce high strong lensing (SL)
cross-sections is not well understood. It has been suggested that the baryonic
condensation of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) due to cooling may drag dark
matter to the cores and thus steepen the profile. In this work, we search for
evidence of ongoing ICM cooling in the first large, well-defined sample of
strong lensing selected galaxy clusters in the range 0.1 < z < 0.6. Based on
known correlations between the ICM cooling rate and both optical emission line
luminosity and star formation, we measure, for a sample of 89 strong lensing
clusters, the fraction of clusters that have [OII]3727 emission in their
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the fraction of line-emitting BCGs
is constant as a function of redshift for z > 0.2 and shows no statistically
significant deviation from the total cluster population. Specific star
formation rates, as traced by the strength of the 4000 angstrom break, D_4000,
are also consistent with the general cluster population. Finally, we use
optical imaging of the SL clusters to measure the angular separation, R_arc,
between the arc and the center of mass of each lensing cluster in our sample
and test for evidence of changing [OII] emission and D_4000 as a function of
R_arc, a proxy observable for SL cross-sections. D_4000 is constant with all
values of R_arc, and the [OII] emission fractions show no dependence on R_arc
for R_arc > 10"" and only very marginal evidence of increased weak [OII]
emission for systems with R_arc < 10"". These results argue against the ability
of baryonic cooling associated with cool core activity in the cores of galaxy
clusters to strongly modify the underlying dark matter potential, leading to an
increase in strong lensing cross-sections.

simulations on Cartesian meshes as well as arbitrary static and moving Voronoi
meshes is presented. Most major astrophysical fluid dynamics codes use a finite
volume (FV) approach. We demonstrate that the DG technique offers distinct
advantages over FV formulations on both static and moving meshes. The DG method
is also easily generalized to higher than second-order accuracy without
requiring the use of extended stencils to estimate derivatives (thereby making
the scheme highly parallelizable). We implement the technique in the AREPO code
for solving the fluid and the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. By examining
various test problems, we show that our new formulation provides improved
accuracy over FV approaches of the same order, and reduces post-shock
oscillations and artificial diffusion of angular momentum. In addition, the DG
method makes it possible to represent magnetic fields in a locally
divergence-free way, improving the stability of MHD simulations and moderating
global divergence errors, and is a viable alternative for solving the MHD
equations on meshes where Constrained-Transport (CT) cannot be applied. We find
that the DG procedure on a moving mesh is more sensitive to the choice of slope
limiter than is its FV method counterpart. Therefore, future work to improve
the performance of the DG scheme even further will likely involve the design of
optimal slope limiters. As presently constructed, our technique offers the
potential of improved accuracy in astrophysical simulations using the moving

  Binary Progenitors","  We present a detailed investigation of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
rest-frame UV/optical observations of 22 short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host
galaxies and sub-galactic environments. Utilizing the high angular resolution
and depth of HST, we characterize the host galaxy morphologies, measure precise
projected physical and host-normalized offsets between the bursts and host
centers, and calculate the locations of the bursts with respect to their host
light distributions (rest-frame UV and optical). We calculate a median short
GRB projected physical offset of 4.5 kpc, about 3.5 times larger than that for
long GRBs, and find that ~25% of short GRBs have offsets of >10 kpc. When
compared to their host sizes, the median offset is 1.5 half-light radii (r_e),
about 1.5 times larger than the values for long GRBs, core-collapse supernovae,
and Type Ia supernovae. In addition, ~20% of short GRBs having offsets of >5
r_e, and only ~25% are located within 1 r_e. We further find that short GRBs
severely under-represent their hosts' rest-frame optical and UV light, with
~30-45% of the bursts located in regions of their host galaxies that have no
detectable stellar light, and ~55% in the regions with no UV light. Therefore,
short GRBs do not occur in regions of star formation or even stellar mass. This
demonstrates that the progenitor systems of short GRBs must migrate from their
birth sites to their eventual explosion sites, a signature of kicks in compact
object binary systems. Utilizing the full sample of offsets, we estimate natal
kick velocities of ~20-140 km s^-1. These independent lines of evidence provide
the strongest support to date that short GRBs result from the merger of compact
object binaries (NS-NS/NS-BH).

which the supermassive black holes (BHs) powering luminous z ~ 6 QSOs grow from
massive seeds. We simulate at high resolution 18 fields sampling regions with
densities ranging from the mean cosmic density all the way to the highest sigma
peaks in the Millennium simulation volume. Only in the most massive halos, BHs
can grow to masses up to ~ 10^9 Msun by z ~ 6 without invoking super-Eddington
accretion. Accretion onto the most massive BHs becomes limited by thermal AGN
feedback by z ~ 9-8 with further BH growth proceeding in short Eddington
limited bursts. Our modelling suggests that current flux-limited surveys of
QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect objects at their peak luminosity
and therefore miss a substantial population of QSOs powered by similarly
massive BHs but with low accretion rates. To test whether the required host
halo masses are consistent with the observed galaxy environment of z ~ 6 QSOs,
we produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies. Without
strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of bright galaxies
larger than observed by a factor ten or more. Supernova-driven galactic winds
reduce the predicted numbers to a level consistent with observations indicating
that stellar feedback was already very efficient at high redshifts. We have
further investigated the effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas.
Our adopted AGN feedback prescription drives mostly energy-driven highly

consistent with observations. The spatially extended thermal X-ray emission
around bright QSOs powered by these outflows can exceed by large factors the
emission expected without AGN feedback and is an important diagnostic of the
mechanism whereby AGN feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.

prompted much speculation on its origin. In this Letter, we propose that G2
formed out of the debris stream produced by the removal of mass from the outer
envelope of a nearby giant star. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the
returning tidal debris stream with cooling, and find that the stream condenses
into clumps that fall periodically onto Sgr A*. We propose that one of these
clumps is the observed G2 cloud, with the rest of the stream being detectable
at lower Br-$\gamma$ emissivity along a trajectory that would trace from G2 to
the star that was partially disrupted. By simultaneously fitting the orbits of
S2, G2, and $\sim$ 2,000 candidate stars, and by fixing the orbital plane of
each candidate star to G2 (as is expected for a tidal disruption), we find that
several stars have orbits that are compatible with the notion that one of them
was tidally disrupted to produce G2. If one of these stars were indeed
disrupted, it last encountered Sgr A* hundreds of years ago, and has likely
encountered Sgr A* repeatedly. However, while these stars are compatible with
the giant disruption scenario given their measured positions and proper
motions, their radial velocities are currently unknown. If one of these stars'
radial velocity is measured to be compatible with a disruptive orbit, it would
strongly suggest its disruption produced G2.

  Shocks. I. Particle Energy Spectra and Acceleration Mechanism","  Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies in low Mach number (M<5) shocks
is revealed by radio and X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and solar
flares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood.
Diffusive shock acceleration, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration,
cannot be directly invoked to explain the acceleration of electrons. Rather, an
additional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal
to supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process.
In this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma
simulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus
on the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference
run with M=3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field. We find that
about 15 percent of the electrons can be efficiently accelerated, forming a
non-thermal power-law tail in the energy spectrum with a slope of p~2.4.
Initially, thermal electrons are energized at the shock front via shock drift
acceleration. The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream, where
their interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the
waves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock, for
further energization via shock drift acceleration. In summary, the
self-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of shock drift acceleration,
similarly to a sustained Fermi-like process. This mechanism offers a natural
solution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed
from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration
efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.

1630-47) and a new X-ray transient (NuSTAR J163433-473841), NuSTAR locates
three sources from the Chandra survey of this region whose spectra are extended
above 10 keV for the first time: CXOU J163329.5-473332, CXOU J163350.9-474638,
and CXOU J163355.1-473804. Imaging, timing, and spectral data from a broad
X-ray range (0.3-79 keV) are analyzed and interpreted with the aim of
classifying these objects. CXOU J163329.5-473332 is either a cataclysmic
variable or a faint low-mass X-ray binary. CXOU J163350.9-474638 varies in
intensity on year-long timescales, and with no multi-wavelength counterpart, it
could be a distant X-ray binary or possibly a magnetar. CXOU J163355.1-473804
features a helium-like iron line at 6.7 keV and is classified as a nearby
cataclysmic variable. Additional surveys are planned for the Norma Arm and
Galactic Center, and those NuSTAR observations will benefit from the lessons
learned during this pilot study.

from 0.5-1 $\mu$m and Clio2 operating from 1-5 $\mu$m. MagAO was installed in
2012 and successfully completed two commissioning runs in 2012-2013. In April
2014 we had our first science run that was open to the general Magellan

using a variety of data from the Hinode spacecraft. We have also inferred the
atmospheric stratification of the physical parameters by means of the inversion
of the observed Stokes profiles employing the Stokes Inversion based on
Response functions (SIR) code. Finally, we analyzed their evolution using a
time series from the same instrument. Blue-shifted events tend to appear over
bright regions at the edge of granules, while red-shifted events are seen
predominantly over dark regions on intergranular lanes. Large linear
polarization signals can be seen in the region that connects them. The magnetic
structure inferred from the time series revealed that the structure corresponds
to a $\Omega$-loop, with one footpoint always over the edge of a granule and
the other inside an intergranular lane. The physical parameters obtained from
the inversions of the observed Stokes profiles in both events show an increase
with respect to the Harvard-Smithonian reference atmosphere in the temperature
at $\log\tau_{500} \in (-1, -3)$ and a strong magnetic field, $B \ge 1$ kG, at
the bottom of the atmosphere that quickly decreases upward until vanishing at
$\log\tau_{500} \approx -2$. In the blue-shifted events, the line of sight
velocities change from upflows at the bottom to downflows at the top of the
atmosphere. Red-shifted events display the opposite velocity stratification.
The change of sign in line of sight velocity happens at the same optical depth
in which the magnetic field becomes zero. The physical mechanism that best
explains the inferred magnetic field configuration and flow motions is a siphon
flow along an arched magnetic flux tube. Further investigation is required
however, as the expected features of a siphon flow cannot be unequivocally
identified.

  Pair NGC2207/IC2163","  We present a comprehensive study of the total X-ray emission from the
colliding galaxy pair NGC2207/IC2163, based on Chandra, Spitzer, and GALEX
data. We detect 28 ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), 7 of which were not
detected previously due to X-ray variability. Twelve sources show significant
long-term variability, with no correlated spectral changes. Seven sources are
transient candidates. One ULX coincides with an extremely blue star cluster
(B-V = -0.7). We confirm that the global relation between the number and
luminosity of ULXs and the integrated star formation rate (SFR) of the host
galaxy also holds on local scales. We investigate the effects of dust
extinction and/or age on the X-ray binary (XRB) population on sub-galactic
scales. The distributions of Nx and Lx are peaked at L(IR)/L(NUV)~1, which may
be associated with an age of ~10 Myr for the underlying stellar population. We
find that ~1/3 of the XRBs are located in close proximity to young star
complexes. The luminosity function of the X-ray binaries is consistent with
that typical for high-mass X-ray binaries, and appears unaffected by
variability. We disentangle and compare the X-ray diffuse spectrum with that of
the bright XRBs. The hot interstellar medium dominates the diffuse X-ray
emission at E<1 keV, has a temperature kT=0.28 (+0.05/-0.04) keV and intrinsic
0.5-2 keV luminosity of 7.9e+40 erg/s, a factor of ~2.3 higher than the average

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5817v1,"The Dark Matter Halos of Moderate Luminosity X-ray AGN as Determined
  from Weak Gravitational Lensing and Host Stellar Masses","  Understanding the relationship between galaxies hosting active galactic
nuclei (AGN) and the dark matter halos in which they reside is key to
constraining how black-hole fueling is triggered and regulated. Previous
efforts have relied on simple halo mass estimates inferred from clustering,
weak gravitational lensing, or halo occupation distribution modeling. In
practice, these approaches remain uncertain because AGN, no matter how they are
identified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupation
function whose general shape and normalization are poorly known. In this work,
we show that better constraints can be achieved through a rigorous comparison
of the clustering, lensing, and cross-correlation signals of AGN hosts to a
fiducial stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) derived for all galaxies. Our
technique exploits the fact that the global SHMR can be measured with much
higher accuracy than any statistic derived from AGN samples alone. Using 382
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN at z<1 from the COSMOS field, we report the first
measurements of weak gravitational lensing from an X-ray selected sample.
Comparing this signal to predictions from the global SHMR, we find that,
contrary to previous results, most X-ray AGN do not live in medium size groups
---nearly half reside in relatively low mass halos with Mh~10^12.5 Msun. The
AGN occupation function is well described by the same form derived for all
galaxies but with a lower normalization---the fraction of halos with AGN in our
sample is a few percent. By highlighting the relatively ""normal"" way in which
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts occupy halos, our results suggest that the
environmental signature of distinct fueling modes for luminous QSOs compared to
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN is less obvious than previously claimed.

  XO-2S -- Dependence on Stellar Parameters","  The chemical composition of exoplanet host stars is an important factor in
understanding the formation and characteristics of their orbiting planets. The
best example of this to date is the planet-metallicity correlation. Other
proposed correlations are thus far less robust, in part due to uncertainty in
the chemical history of stars pre- and post-planet formation. Binary host stars
of similar type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of planets on
host star abundances. Here we present a differential elemental abundance
analysis of the XO-2 stellar binary, in which both G9 stars host giant planets,
one of which is transiting. Building on our previous work, we report 16
elemental abundances and compare the $\Delta$(XO-2N-XO-S) values to elemental
condensation temperatures. The $\Delta$(N-S) values and slopes with
condensation temperature resulting from four different pairs of stellar
parameters are compared to explore the effects of changing the relative
temperature and gravity of the stars. We find that most of the abundance
differences between the stars depend on the chosen stellar parameters, but that
Fe, Si, and potentially Ni are consistently enhanced in XO-2N regardless of the
chosen stellar parameters. This study emphasizes the power of binary host star
abundance analysis for probing the effects of giant planet formation, but also
illustrates the potentially large uncertainties in abundance differences and
slopes induced by changes in stellar temperature and gravity.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05306v3,A Dark Year for Tidal Disruption Events,"  The disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole results
in the initial production of an extended debris stream that winds repeatedly
around the black hole, producing a complex three-dimensional figure that may
self-intersect. Both analytical work and simulations have shown that typical
encounters generate streams that are extremely thin. In this paper we show that
this implies that even small relativistic precessions attributed to black hole
spin can induce deflections that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even
after many windings. Additionally, hydrodynamical simulations have demonstrated
that energy is deposited very slowly via hydrodynamic processes alone,
resulting in the liberation of very little gravitational binding energy in the
absence of stream-stream collisions. This naturally leads to a ""dark period"" in
which the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen
orbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for
disruptions around black holes with mass $\sim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$. We find that
more-massive black holes tend to have more violent stream self-intersections,
resulting in short viscous times that lead to prompt accretion onto the black
hole. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the
black hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed
delay time $t_{\rm delay}$. For lower black hole masses ($M_{\rm h} \lesssim
10^{6}$), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of
magnitude, and because the accretion rates for TDEs about higher-mass black
hole are already sub-Eddington, this results in the majority of TDEs being
sub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are
biased towards prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been
unidentified. [abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06908v2,Carbon in Red Giants in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies,"  We present carbon abundances of red giants in Milky Way globular clusters and
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our sample includes measurements of carbon
abundances for 154 giants in the clusters NGC 2419, M68, and M15 and 398 giants
in the dSphs Sculptor, Fornax, Ursa Minor, and Draco. This sample doubles the
number of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the
clusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which
can be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is
observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.
Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize
that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with
increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of
asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia
supernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich
giants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases
preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way
stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] < +1 in dSphs follow a
different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in
dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the
metallicity of the [C/Fe] ""knee"" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe]
distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for
chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.

auctions where a buyer wishes to procure multiple units of a homogeneous item
from n sellers who are strategic about their per unit valuation. The buyer
earns the profit by reselling these units in an external consumer market. The
paper looks at three scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we look at unit
capacity sellers where per unit valuation is private information of each seller
and the revenue curve is concave. For this setting, we define two benchmarks.
We show that no randomized prior free auction can be constant competitive
against any of these two benchmarks. However, for a lightly constrained
benchmark we design a prior-free auction PEPA (Profit Extracting Procurement
Auction) which is 4-competitive and we show this bound is tight. Second, we
study a setting where the sellers have non-unit capacities that are common
knowledge and derive similar results. In particular, we propose a prior free
auction PEPAC (Profit Extracting Procurement Auction with Capacity) which is
truthful for any concave revenue curve. Third, we obtain results in the
inherently harder bi-dimensional case where per unit valuation as well as
capacities are private information of the sellers. We show that PEPAC is
truthful and constant competitive for the specific case of linear revenue
curves. We believe that this paper represents the first set of results on
single dimensional and bi-dimensional profit maximizing prior-free multi-unit

  signalling networks","  The study of cellular signalling pathways and their deregulation in disease
states, such as cancer, is a large and extremely complex task. Indeed, these
systems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their
literatures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at
least apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build
significant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems
that are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.
  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the
representation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in
signalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,
capable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by
post-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires
highly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every
interaction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these
conditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from
information contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the
story.
  In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the
representation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive
cognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a
generalization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible
representation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it
allows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much,
detail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides
a basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge
extracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we
can define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.

  Crab Nebula gamma-ray flares","  We develop a model of particle acceleration in explosive reconnection events
in relativistic magnetically-dominated plasmas and apply it to explain
gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula. The model relies on development of
current-driven instabilities on macroscopic scales (not related to plasma skin
depths). Using analytical and numerical methods (fluid and particle-in-cell
simulations), we study a number of model problems in relativistic
magnetically-dominated plasma: (i) we extend Syrovatsky's classical model of
explosive X-point collapse to magnetically-dominated plasmas; (ii) we consider
instability of two-dimensional force-free system of magnetic flux tubes; (iii)
we consider merger of two zero total poloidal current magnetic flux tubes. In
all cases regimes of spontaneous and driven evolution are investigated. We
identify two stages of particle acceleration: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point
collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during
the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection electric field
of the order of the magnetic field. The explosive stage of reconnection
produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend on the average
magnetization. The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger
that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy in a regime of
forced reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds at a
slower reconnection rate. Crab flares result from the initial explosive stages
of magnetic island mergers of magnetic flux tubes produced in the bulk of
nebula at intermediate polar regions. The post-termination shock plasma flow in
the wind sectors with mild magnetization naturally generates large-scale highly

  - II. The importance of environment in the suppression of star formation","  We present an in depth study on the evolution of galaxy properties in compact
groups over the past 3 Gyr. We are using the largest multi-wavelength sample
to-date, comprised 1770 groups (containing 7417 galaxies), in the redshift
range of 0.01<z<0.23. To derive the physical properties of the galaxies we rely
on ultraviolet (UV)-to-infrared spectral energy distribution modeling, using
CIGALE. Our results suggest that during the 3 Gyr period covered by our sample,
the star formation activity of galaxies in our groups has been substantially
reduced (3-10 times). Moreover, their star formation histories as well as their
UV-optical and mid-infrared colors are significantly different from those of
field and cluster galaxies, indicating that compact group galaxies spend more
time transitioning through the green valley. The morphological transformation
from late-type spirals into early-type galaxies occurs in the mid-infrared
transition zone rather than in the UV-optical green valley. We find evidence of
shocks in the emission line ratios and gas velocity dispersions of the
late-type galaxies located below the star forming main sequence. Our results
suggest that in addition to gas stripping, turbulence and shocks might play an
important role in suppressing the star formation in compact group galaxies.

  in gamma-ray bursts","  The origin of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission still defies
explanation, in spite of recent progress made, for example, on the occasional
presence of a thermal component in the spectrum along with the ubiquitous
non-thermal component that is modelled with a Band function. The combination of
finite duration and aperiodic modulations make GRBs hard to characterise
temporally. Although correlations between GRB luminosity and spectral hardness
on one side and time variability on the other side have long been known, the
loose and often arbitrary definition of the latter makes the interpretation
uncertain. We characterise the temporal variability in an objective way and
search for a connection with rest-frame spectral properties for a number of
well-observed GRBs. We studied the individual power density spectra (PDS) of
123 long gamma-ray bursts with measured redshift, rest-frame peak energy Ep,i
of the time-averaged nuFnu spectrum, and well-constrained PDS slope alpha
detected with Swift, Fermi and past spacecraft. The PDS were modelled with a
power law either with or without a break adopting a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo technique. We find a highly significant Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation. The
null hypothesis probability is ~ 10^-9. In the framework of the internal shock
synchrotron model, the Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation can hardly be reconciled
with the predicted Ep,i propto Gamma^-2, unless either variable microphysical
parameters of the shocks or continual electron acceleration are assumed.
Alternatively, in the context of models based on magnetic reconnection, the PDS
slope and Ep,i are linked to the ejecta magnetisation at the dissipation site,
so that more magnetised outflows would produce more variable GRB light curves
at short timescales (<= 1 s), shallower PDS, and higher values of Ep,i.

of the color-morphology-density relations at high z, and the fraction of
disky/boxy spheroids as a function of mass. In each case, the observations
favor a model in which galaxies quench after a major merger builds a massive
spheroid, and disfavor quenching via secular or pure halo processes. We discuss
a variety of physical possibilities for this quenching, and propose a mixed
scenario in which traditional quenching in hot, massive halos is supplemented
by the feedback associated with star formation and quasar activity in a major
merger, which temporarily suppress cooling and establish the conditions of a
dynamically hot halo in the central regions of the host, even in low mass
halos.

early systems. Previously (Li et al. 2007), we showed that luminous quasars at

warm ULIRG owing to heating and feedback from stars and AGN. Furthermore, the
AGN has significant implications for the interpretation of observation of the
hosts. Our results suggest that vigorous star formation in merging progenitors

supporting a merger-driven origin for luminous quasars at high redshifts and

  Dwarf","  [Abridged] We present an 8.5-hour simultaneous radio, X-ray, UV, and optical
observation of the L dwarf binary 2MASSW J0746+20. We detect strong radio
emission, dominated by short-duration periodic pulses at 4.86 GHz with
P=124.32+/-0.11 min. The stability of the pulse profiles and arrival times
demonstrates that they are due to the rotational modulation of a B~1.7 kG
magnetic field. A quiescent non-variable component is also detected, likely due
to emission from a uniform large-scale field. The H-alpha emission exhibits
identical periodicity, but unlike the radio pulses it varies sinusoidally and
is offset by exactly 1/4 of a phase. The sinusoidal variations require
chromospheric emission from a large-scale field structure, with the radio
pulses likely emanating from the magnetic poles. While both light curves can be
explained by a rotating mis-aligned magnetic field, the 1/4 phase lag rules out
a symmetric dipole topology since it would result in a phase lag of 1/2
(poloidal field) or zero (toroidal field). We therefore conclude that either
(i) the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration, which can naturally
explain the 1/4 phase lag; or (ii) the H-alpha and/or radio emission regions
are not trivially aligned with the field. Regardless of the field topology, we
use the measured period along with the known rotation velocity (vsini=27 km/s),
and the binary orbital inclination (i=142 deg), to derive a radius for the
primary star of 0.078+/-0.010 R_sun. This is the first measurement of the
radius of an L dwarf, and along with a mass of 0.085+/-0.010 M_sun it provides
a constraint on the mass-radius relation below 0.1 M_sun. We find that the
radius is about 30% smaller than expected from theoretical models, even for an
age of a few Gyr.

(2x288^3 particles), evolved using the entropy conserving SPH code Gadget-2.
Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired
through filamentary ""cold mode"" accretion of gas that was never shock heated to
its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results
obtained with a different SPH code (Keres et al. 2005). Atmospheres of hot,
virialized gas develop in halos above ~2.5e11 Msun, a transition mass that is
nearly constant from z=3 to z=0. Cold accretion persists in halos above the
transition mass, especially at z>=2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low
mass halos at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation
history. Satellite galaxies have accretion rates similar to central galaxies of
the same baryonic mass at high redshifts, but they have less accretion than
comparable central galaxies at low redshift. Relative to our earlier results,
the Gadget-2 simulations predict much lower rates of ""hot mode"" accretion from
the virialized gas component of massive halos. At z<=1, typical hot accretion
rates in halos above 5e12 Msun are below 1 Msun/yr, even though our simulation
does not include AGN heating or other forms of ""preventive"" feedback. The inner
density profiles of hot gas in these halos are shallow, with long associated
cooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can
overestimate the accretion rates in these halos by orders of magnitude, so such
models may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed
galaxy masses and colors. A fraction of the massive halos develop cuspy
profiles and significant cooling rates between z=1 and z=0, a redshift trend
similar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.

  theory and observations","  The standard model of gravitational structure formation is based on the Jeans
1902 acoustic theory, neglecting nonlinear instabilities controlled by
viscosity, turbulence and diffusion. Because the Jeans scale L_J for the hot
primordial plasma is always slightly larger than the scale of causal connection
ct, where c is the speed of light and t is the time after the big bang, it has
been assumed that no plasma structures could form without guidance from a cold
(so L_J CDM is small) collisionless cold-dark-matter CDM fluid to give
condensations that gravitationally collect the plasma. Galaxies by this CDM
model form by gradual hierarchical-clustering of CDM halos to galaxy mass over
billions of years. No observations exist of CDM halos. Gravitational
instability is non-linear and absolute, controlled by viscous and turbulent
forces or by diffusivity at Schwarz length scales smaller than ct. Because the
universe during the plasma epoch is rapidly expanding, the first structures
formed were at density minima by fragmentation when the viscous-gravitional
scale L_SV first matched ct at 30,000 years to produce protosupercluster voids
and protosuperclusters. Weak turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries
guide the morphology of smaller fragments down to protogalaxy size just before
transition to gas at 300,000 years. The size of the protogalaxies reflect the
plasma Kolmogorov scale with a linear and spiral morphology predicted by the
Nomura direct numerical simulations and confirmed by deep field space telescope
observations. On transition to gas the kinematic viscosity decreases by ten
trillion so the protogalaxies fragment as Jeans scale clouds, each with a
trillion earth-mass planets, as predicted by Gibson 1996 and observed by Schild

  The ultra-compact binary nature of SDSS J090221.35+381941.9 was confirmed
using phase-resolved spectroscopy at the Keck-I telescope. From the
characteristic radial velocity `S-wave' observed in the helium emission lines
we measure an orbital period of 48.31 +/- 0.08 min. The continuum emission can
be described with a blackbody or a helium white dwarf atmosphere of T_eff ~
15,000K, in agreement with theoretical cooling models for relatively massive
accretors and/or donors. The absence in the spectrum of broad helium absorption
lines from the accreting white dwarf suggests that the accreting white dwarf
cannot be much hotter than 15,000K, or that an additional component such as the
accretion disk contributes substantially to the optical flux.

Our sample contains about 10^3-10^4 objects per spectral type bin in the range
M0-M9, with a total of about 206,000 spectra and a typical number of 3
exposures per object (ranging up to a maximum of 30 exposures). Using this

emission in at least one exposure, and of those about 45% exhibit H-alpha
emission in all of the available exposures. Within the sample of objects with
H-alpha emission, only 26% are consistent with non-variable emission,
independent of spectral type. The H-alpha variability, quantified in terms of
the ratio of maximum to minimum H-alpha equivalent width (R_EW), and the ratio
of the standard deviation to the mean (sigma_EW/<EW>), exhibits a rapid rise
from M0 to M5, followed by a plateau and a possible decline in M9 objects. In
particular, R_EW increases from a median value of about 1.8 for M0-M3 to about
2.5 for M7-M9, and variability with R_EW>10 is only observed in objects later
than M5. For the combined sample we find that the R_EW values follow an
exponential distribution with N(R_EW) exp[-(R_EW-1)/2]; for M5-M9 objects the
characteristic scale is R_EW-1\approx 2.7, indicative of stronger variability.
In addition, we find that objects with persistent H-alpha emission exhibit
smaller values of R_EW than those with intermittent H-alpha emission. Based on
these results we conclude that H-alpha variability in M dwarfs on timescales of
15 min to 1 hr increases with later spectral type, and that the variability is
larger for intermittent sources.

fractions displaying greater mass discrepancies, and thus greater departures
from hydrostatic equilibrium; (iii) cluster substructure fraction is also
correlated with the slope of the gas density profile on small scales, implying
a connection between cluster-cluster mergers and gas cooling. Overall our
results are consistent with the view that cluster-cluster mergers play a
prominent role in shaping the properties of cluster cores, in particular
causing departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, and possibly disturbing cool
cores. Our results do not support recent claims that large Einstein radius
clusters present a challenge to the CDM paradigm.

supernova (SN) 2008iy. SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of
~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to
reach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r
~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x
10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN
1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both
supernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission
profile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a
pre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is
powered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar
medium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of
clumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the
progenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic
phase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor
wind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the
former scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes
observed for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and
increased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and
perhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before
core collapse. We also discuss the host galaxy of SN 2008iy, a subluminous
dwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons why the recent suggestion that unusual,
luminous supernovae preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result of
observational biases.

observations uncover a coincident compact red galaxy, identified as an
early-type galaxy at a photometric redshift of z~0.6-0.9 (2-sigma) with a mass
of 3x10^10 M_Sun, an age of ~1 Gyr, and a luminosity of L_B~0.5L_star.
Spectroscopic observations of the host reveal a notable break corresponding to
the Balmer 4000-Angstrom break at z~0.9, and stellar population spectral
evolution template fits indicate z~0.915, which we adopt as the redshift of the
host, with stellar population ages of ~1-3 Gyr. From a possible weak detection
of [OII]-3727 emission at z=0.915 we infer an upper bound on the star formation
rate of ~0.1 M_Sun per yr, leading to a specific star formation rate of <0.004
per Gyr. Thus, GRB 100117A is only the second short burst to date with a secure
early-type host (the other being GRB 050724 at z=0.257) and it has one of the
highest short GRB redshifts. The offset between the host center and the burst
position, 470 +/- 310 pc, is the smallest to date. Combined with the old
stellar population age, this indicates that the burst likely originated from a
progenitor with no significant kick velocity. However, from the brightness of
the optical afterglow we infer a relatively low density of n~3x10^-4 cm^-3 when

Faber-Jackson (FJ) and Tully-Fisher (TF) relations. We combine measurements of
dark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and the
distribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scaling
relations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmological
simulations. The principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formation
and the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The slopes of the TF and FJ
relations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and IMFs.
However, models with a universal IMF and universal halo response cannot
simultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the TF and FJ relations. For a
model with a universal Chabrier IMF, LTGs require halo expansion, while ETGs
require halo contraction. A Salpeter IMF is permitted for high mass (sigma >
180 km/s) ETGs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unless
V_circ(R_e)/sigma_e > 1.6. If the IMF is universal and close to Chabrier, we
speculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for the
contraction in ETGs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads to
expansion in LTGs. Alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the IMF
disfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. Finally we show that our
models naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profiles

  and Implications for Magellanic Irregulars","  We present a novel pair of numerical models of the interaction history
between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) and
our Milky Way (MW) in light of recent high precision proper motions
(Kallivayalil et al. 2006a,b). Given the new velocities, cosmological
simulations of structure formation favor a scenario where the Magellanic Clouds
(MCs) are currently on their first infall towards our Galaxy (Boylan-Kolchin et
al. 2011, Busha et al. 2011). We illustrate here that the observed irregular
morphology and internal kinematics of the MCs (in gas and stars) are naturally
explained by interactions between the LMC and SMC, rather than gravitational
interactions with the MW. This picture further supports a first infall scenario
(Besla et a. 2007). In particular, we demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a
band of HI gas trailing behind the MCs 150 degrees across the sky, can be
accounted for by the action of LMC tides on the SMC before the system was
accreted by the MW. We further demonstrate that the off-center, warped stellar
bar of the LMC and its one-armed spiral, can be naturally explained by a recent
direct collision with the SMC. Such structures are key morphological
characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to as Magellanic Irregulars (de
Vaucouleurs & Freeman 1972), the majority of which are not associated with
massive spiral galaxies. We infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions are
important drivers for the morphological evolution of Magellanic Irregulars and
can dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxies
via the formation of extended tidal bridges and tails. Such interactions are
important not only for the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have direct
consequences for the buildup of baryons in our own MW, as LMC-mass systems are
believed to be the dominant building blocks of MW-type halos.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2434v2,Observational Probes of Cosmic Acceleration,"  The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising
cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated
by some form of ""dark energy"" with exotic physical properties, or that
Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound
implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental
efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with
percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well
established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters.
We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques
and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ""Stage
IV"" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We
briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space
distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H_0. We
present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of
state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage
IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and
CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to
provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We
emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most
powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties
and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic
acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the
longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater
detail over ever larger scales.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5892v2,Subhaloes in Self-Interacting Galactic Dark Matter Haloes,"  We present N-body simulations of a new class of self-interacting dark matter
models, which do not violate any astrophysical constraints due to a
non-power-law velocity dependence of the transfer cross section which is
motivated by a Yukawa-like new gauge boson interaction. Specifically, we focus
on the formation of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo taken from the Aquarius
project and re-simulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowed
parameter space of this new model. We find that for these cases, the main halo
only develops a small core (~1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical to
that of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. Neither
the subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes are
altered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner density
structure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. As a
consequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloes
differ significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstrate
that they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest Milky Way
dSphs in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario.
Specifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloes
that are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of the
Milky Way dSphs. We conclude that these models offer an interesting alternative
to the cold dark matter model that can reduce the recently reported tension
between the brightest Milky Way satellites and the dense subhaloes found in
cold dark matter simulations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6203v2,The cold veil of the Milky Way stellar halo,"  We build a sample of distant (D > 80 kpc) stellar halo stars with measured
radial velocities. Faint ($20 < g <22$) candidate blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars were selected using the deep, but wide, multi-epoch Sloan Digital Sky
Survey photometry. Follow-up spectroscopy for these A-type stars was performed
using the VLT-FORS2 instrument. We classify stars according to their Balmer
line profiles, and find 7 are bona fide BHB stars and 31 are blue stragglers
(BS). Owing to the magnitude range of our sample, even the intrinsically
fainter BS stars can reach out to D ~ 90 kpc. We complement this sample of
A-type stars with intrinsically brighter, intermediate-age, asymptotic giant
branch stars. A set of 4 distant cool carbon stars is compiled from the
literature and we perform spectroscopic follow-up on a further 4 N-type carbon
stars using the WHT-ISIS instrument. Altogether, this provides us with the
largest sample to date of individual star tracers out to r ~ 150 kpc. We find
that the radial velocity dispersion of these tracers falls rapidly at large
distances and is surprisingly cold (sigma_r ~ 50-60 km/s) between 100-150 kpc.
Relating the measured radial velocities to the mass of the Milky Way requires
knowledge of the (unknown) tracer density profile and anisotropy at these
distances. Nonetheless, by assuming the stellar halo stars between 50-150 kpc
have a moderate density fall-off (with power-law slope alpha < 5) and are on
radial orbits (sigma^2_t/sigma^2_r < 1), we infer that the mass within 150 kpc
is less than 10^12 M_solar and suggest it probably lies in the range (5-10) x
10^11 M_solar. We discuss the implications of such a low mass for the Milky
Way.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0011v2,"Star Formation in Galaxy Mergers with Realistic Models of Stellar
  Feedback & the Interstellar Medium","  We use simulations with realistic models for stellar feedback to study galaxy
mergers. These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and
destruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is
dominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to
global torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.
The gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and
subsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast
to some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the
central bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of
the galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several
percent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus
does so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a
consequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the
small-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this
relation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR
photons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the
most extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives
super-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind
material falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher
post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is
required to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. We compare the
predicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disk
survival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve GMCs or feedback.
Global galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and star
formation rates can differ significantly.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1071v1,"Localizing INTEGRAL Sources with Chandra: X-Ray and Multi-Wavelength
  Identifications and Energy Spectra","  We report on Chandra observations of 18 hard X-ray (>20 keV) sources
discovered with the INTEGRAL satellite near the Galactic plane. For 14 of the
INTEGRAL sources, we have uncovered one or two potential Chandra counterparts
per source. These provide soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) spectra and sub-arcsecond
localizations, which we use to identify counterparts at other wavelengths,
providing information about the nature of each source. Despite the fact that
all of the sources are within 5 degrees of the plane, four of the IGR sources
are AGN (IGR J01545+6437, IGR J15391-5307, IGR J15415-5029, and IGR
J21565+5948) and four others are likely AGN (IGR J03103+5706, IGR J09189-4418,
IGR J16413-4046, and IGR J16560-4958) based on each of them having a strong IR
excess and/or extended optical or near-IR emission. We compare the X-ray and
near-IR fluxes of this group of sources to those of AGN selected by their 2-10
keV emission in previous studies and find that these IGR AGN are in the range
of typical values. There is evidence in favor of four of the sources being
Galactic (IGR J12489-6243, IGR J15293-5609, IGR J16173-5023, and IGR
J16206-5253), but only IGR J15293-5609 is confirmed as a Galactic source as it
has a unique Chandra counterpart and a parallax measurement from previous
optical observations that puts its distance at 1.56+/-0.12 kpc. The 0.3-10 keV
luminosity for this source is 1.4e32 erg/s, and its optical/IR spectral energy
distribution is well described by a blackbody with a temperature of 4200-7000 K
and a radius of 12.0-16.4 Rsun. These values suggest that IGR J15293-5609 is a
symbiotic binary with an early K-type giant and a white dwarf accretor. We also
obtained likely Chandra identifications for IGR J13402-6428 and IGR
J15368-5102, but follow-up observations are required to constrain their source

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5769v1,A Fokker-Planck Study of Dense Rotating Stellar Clusters,"  The dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems is simulated using a
two-dimensional Fokker-Planck method, with the goal of providing a model for
the formation of supermassive stars which could serve as seed objects for the
supermassive black holes of quasars. This work follows and expands on earlier
1-D studies of spherical clusters of main-sequence stars. The 2-D approach
allows for the study of rotating systems, as would be expected due to
cosmological tidal torquing; other physical effects included are collisional
mergers of stars and a bulk stellar bar perturbation in the gravitational
potential. The 3 Myr main-sequence lifetime for large stars provides an upper
limit on simulation times. Two general classes of initial systems are studied:
Plummer spheres, which represent stellar clusters, and \gamma=0 spheres, which
model galactic spheroids.
  At the initial densities of the modeled systems, mass segregation and runaway
stellar collisions alone are insufficient to induce core collapse within the
lifetime limit if no bar perturbation is included. However, core collapse is
not a requirement for the formation of a massive object: the choice of stellar
initial mass function is found to play a crucial role. When using an IMF
similar to that observed for dense stellar clusters the simulations show that
the stellar system forms massive (250M_\odot) objects by collisional mergers;
in almost all such cases the presence of a stellar bar allows for sufficient
additional outward transport of angular momentum that a core-collapse state is
reached with corresponding further increase in the rate of formation of massive
objects. In contrast, simulations using an IMF similar to that observed for
field stars in general (which is weighted more towards lower masses) produce no
massive objects, and reach core collapse only for initial models which
represent the highest-density galactic spheriods.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1377v2,Direct detection of self-interacting dark matter,"  Self-interacting dark matter offers an interesting alternative to
collisionless dark matter because of its ability to preserve the large-scale
success of the cold dark matter model, while seemingly solving its challenges
on small scales. We present here the first study of the expected dark matter
detection signal taking into account different self-scattering models. We
demonstrate that models with constant and velocity dependent cross sections,
which are consistent with observational constraints, lead to distinct
signatures in the velocity distribution, because non-thermalised features found
in the cold dark matter distribution are thermalised through particle
scattering. Depending on the model, self-interaction can lead to a 10%
reduction of the recoil rates at high energies, corresponding to a minimum
speed that can cause recoil larger than 300 km/s, compared to the cold dark
matter case. At lower energies these differences are smaller than 5% for all
models. The amplitude of the annual modulation signal can increase by up to
25%, and the day of maximum amplitude can shift by about two weeks with respect
to the cold dark matter expectation. Furthermore, the exact day of phase
reversal of the modulation signal can also differ by about a week between the
different models. In general, models with velocity dependent cross sections
peaking at the typical velocities of dwarf galaxies lead only to minor changes
in the detection signals, whereas allowed constant cross section models lead to
significant changes. We conclude that different self-interacting dark matter
scenarios might be distinguished from each other through the details of direct
detection signals. Furthermore, detailed constraints on the intrinsic
properties of dark matter based on null detections, should take into account
the possibility of self-scattering and the resulting effects on the detector
signal.

  Observables","  We present new predictions for temperature (on small angular scales) and
polarization (on large angular scales) CMB anisotropies induced during the
epoch of reionization (EoR). Using a novel method calibrated from
Radiation-Hydrodynamic simulations we model the EoR in large volumes (L >~ 2
Gpc/h) in the context of galactic reionization. We find that the EoR
contribution to the kinetic Sunyaev- Zel'dovich power spectrum (patchy kSZ)
ranges between ~0.6 - 2.8 muK^2 at ell = 3000, for the parameter space we
explored. These patchy kSZ power spectra are calculated from large 15 Deg x 15
Deg maps that are found to be necessary. Decreasing the size of these maps
biases the overall patchy kSZ power to higher values. We find that the
amplitude of the patchy kSZ power spectrum at ell = 3000 follows simple
scalings of D_ell=3000^kSZ propto <z> and D_ell=3000^kSZ propto Delz^0.47 for
the mean redshift (<z>) of reionization and the duration (dz). Using the
constraints on <z> from WMAP 7-year results and the lower limit on dz from
EDGES we find a lower limit of ~ 0.4 muK^2 on the kSZ at ell = 3000. Planck
will constrain the mean redshift and the Thomson optical depth from the low-ell
polarization power spectrum. Future measurements of the high-ell CMB power
spectrum from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) should detect the patchy kSZ signal if the cross correlation
between the cosmic infrared background and the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich
effect is constrained. We show that the combination of temperature and
polarization measurements constrains both <z> and dz. The patchy kSZ maps,
power spectra templates and the polarization power spectra will be publicly

  cluster as a measure for the effective ICM viscosity","  Sloshing cold fronts (CFs) arise from minor merger triggered gas sloshing.
Their detailed structure depends on the properties of the intra-cluster medium
(ICM): hydrodynamical simulations predict the CFs to be distorted by
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs), but aligned magnetic fields, viscosity,
or thermal conduction can suppress the KHIs. Thus, observing the detailed
structure of sloshing CFs can be used to constrain these ICM properties. Both
smooth and distorted sloshing CFs have been observed, indicating that the KHI
is suppressed in some clusters, but not in all. Consequently, we need to
address at least some sloshing clusters individually before drawing general
conclusions about the ICM properties. We present the first detailed attempt to
constrain the ICM properties in a specific cluster from the structure of its
sloshing CF. Proximity and brightness make the Virgo cluster an ideal target.
We combine observations and Virgo-specific hydrodynamical sloshing simulations.
Here we focus on a Spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity as a mechanism
to suppress the KHI, but discuss the alternative mechanisms in detail. We
identify the CF at 90 kpc north and north-east of the Virgo center as the best
location in the cluster to observe a possible KHI suppression. For viscosities
$\gtrsim$ 10% of the Spitzer value KHIs at this CF are suppressed. We describe
in detail the observable signatures at low and high viscosities, i.e. in the
presence or absence of KHIs. We find indications for a low ICM viscosity in
archival XMM-Newton data and demonstrate the detectability of the predicted
features in deep Chandra observations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0841v2,Resolving The Generation of Starburst Winds in Galaxy Mergers,"  We study galaxy super-winds driven in major mergers, using pc-resolution
simulations with detailed models for stellar feedback that can
self-consistently follow the formation/destruction of GMCs and generation of
winds. The models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densities
in GMCs, and gas recycling and feedback from SNe (I&II), stellar winds, and
radiation pressure. We study mergers of systems from SMC-like dwarfs and Milky
Way analogues to z~2 starburst disks. Multi-phase super-winds are generated in
all passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 M_sun/yr. However, the wind
mass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by SFR) is similar to that in
isolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy
properties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of the
merger. Winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build up
complex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at a
range of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with
material at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,
ionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedback
mechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,
where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced
starbursts. But despite large mass-loading factors (>~10) in the winds, the
peak SFRs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations. Wind acceleration
does not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum and
form stars, while blowing out gas that would not have participated in the
starburst in the first place. Considerable wind material is not unbound, and
falls back on the disk at later times post-merger, leading to higher
post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. This may require AGN
feedback to explain galaxy quenching.

multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism
MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From
PRIMUS we construct an i<23 flux-limited sample of ~40,000 galaxies at
z=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ~5.5 deg^2, and from the SDSS we select
~170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to
PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find
that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we
do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ~30% increase in
the number density of ~10^10 Msun galaxies since z~0.6, and a <10% change in
the number density of all >10^11 Msun galaxies since z~1. Dividing the sample
into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific
star-formation rate, we find that the number density of ~10^10 Msun
star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z~0.6, whereas the
space-density of >10^11 Msun star-forming galaxies decreases by ~50% between
z~1 and z~0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~10^10 Msun quiescent galaxies
increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z~0.6, while
the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since
z~1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are
quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the
stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~10^10.8
Msun. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant
channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z<1, even among massive
(>10^11 Msun) quiescent galaxies.

using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code
AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the
origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative
comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches,
we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of
accreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous
work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming
in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats
to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same
galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11
solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same
halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold
accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive
systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard
formulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from
cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is a
consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value
independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of
accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated
and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large
number of purely numerical ""blobs"". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased
heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas
accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.

survey of Cas A and represent the most complete catalog of its optically
emitting material to date. We confirm that the bulk of Cas A's optically bright
ejecta populate a torus-like geometry tilted approximately 30 degrees with
respect to the plane of the sky with a -4000 to +6000 km/s radial velocity
asymmetry. Near-tangent viewing angle effects and an inhomogeneous surrounding
CSM/ISM environment suggest that this geometry and velocity asymmetry may not
be faithfully representative of the remnant's true 3D structure or the
kinematic properties of the original explosion. The majority of the optical
ejecta are arranged in several well-defined and nearly circular ring-like
structures with diameters between approximately 30 arcsec (0.5 pc) and 2 arcmin
(2 pc). These ejecta rings appear to be a common phenomenon of young
core-collapse remnants and may be associated with post-explosion input of
energy from plumes of radioactive 56Ni-rich ejecta that rise, expand, and
compress non-radioactive material. Our optical survey also encompassed Cas A's
faint outlying ejecta knots and exceptionally high-velocity NE and SW streams
of S-rich debris often referred to as `jets'. These outer knots, which exhibit
a chemical make-up suggestive of an origin deep within the progenitor star,
appear to be arranged in opposing and wide-angle outflows with opening
half-angles of approximately 40 degrees.

  Chandra X-ray Observatory Detectors","  The thermal evolution of young neutron stars (NSs) reflects the neutrino
emission properties of their cores. Heinke et al. (2010) measured a 3.6+/-0.6%
decay in the surface temperature of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) NS between 2000
and 2009, using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S
detector in Graded mode. Page et al. (2011) and Shternin et al. (2011)
attributed this decay to enhanced neutrino emission from a superfluid neutron
transition in the core. Here we test this decline, combining analysis of the
Cas A NS using all Chandra X-ray detectors and modes (HRC-S, HRC-I, ACIS-I,
ACIS-S in Faint mode, and ACIS-S in Graded mode) and adding a 2012 May ACIS-S
Graded mode observation, using the most current calibrations (CALDB 4.5.5.1).
We measure the temperature changes from each detector separately and test for
systematic effects due to the nearby filaments of the supernova remnant. We
find a 0.92%-2.0% decay over 10 years in the effective temperature, inferred
from HRC-S data, depending on the choice of source and background extraction
regions, with a best-fit decay of 1.0+/-0.7%. In comparison, the ACIS-S Graded
data indicate a temperature decay of 3.1%-5.0% over 10 years, with a best-fit
decay of 3.5+/-0.4%. Shallower observations using the other detectors yield
temperature decays of 2.6+/-1.9% (ACIS-I), 2.1+/-1.0% (HRC-I), and 2.1+/-1.9%
(ACIS-S Faint mode) over 10 years. Our best estimate indicates a decline of
2.9+/-0.9 (stat) +1.6/-0.3 (sys) % over 10 years. The complexity of the bright
and varying supernova remnant background makes a definitive interpretation of
archival Cas A Chandra observations difficult. A temperature decline of 1-3.5%
over 10 years would indicate extraordinarily fast cooling of the NS that can be
regulated by superfluidity of nucleons in the stellar core.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5265v1,Modeling X-ray binary evolution in normal galaxies: Insights from SINGS,"  We present the largest-scale comparison to date between observed
extragalactic X-ray binary (XRB) populations and theoretical models of their
production. We construct observational X-ray luminosity functions (oXLFs) using
Chandra observations of 12 late-type galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxy Survey (SINGS). For each galaxy, we obtain theoretical XLFs (tXLFs) by
combining XRB synthetic models, constructed with the population synthesis code
StarTrack, with observational star formation histories (SFHs). We identify
highest-likelihood models both for individual galaxies and globally, averaged
over the full galaxy sample. Individual tXLFs successfully reproduce about half
of oXLFs, but for some galaxies we are unable to find underlying source
populations, indicating that galaxy SFHs and metallicities are not well matched
and/or XRB modeling requires calibration on larger observational samples. Given
these limitations, we find that best models are consistent with a product of
common envelope ejection efficiency and central donor concentration ~=0.1, and
a 50% uniform -- 50% ""twins"" initial mass-ratio distribution. We present and
discuss constituent subpopulations of tXLFs according to donor, accretor and
stellar population characteristics. The galaxy-wide X-ray luminosity due to
low-mass and high-mass XRBs, estimated via our best global model tXLF, follows
the general trend expected from the L_x - star formation rate and L_x - stellar
mass relations of Lehmer et al 2010. Our best models are also in agreement with
modeling of the evolution both of XRBs over cosmic time and of the galaxy X-ray
luminosity with redshift.

strong lensing cluster cores. Structure is traced by groups that are identified
spectroscopically in the redshift range, 0.1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.9, and we
measure the projected angular and comoving separations between each group and
the primary strong lensing clusters in each corresponding line of sight. From
these data we measure the distribution of projected angular separations between
the primary strong lensing clusters and uncorrelated large scale structure as
traced by groups. We then compare the observed distribution of angular
separations for our strong lensing selected lines of sight against the
distribution of groups that is predicted for clusters lying along random lines
of sight. There is clear evidence for an excess of structure along the line of
sight at small angular separations ($\theta \leq 6'$) along the strong lensing
selected lines of sight, indicating that uncorrelated structure is a
significant systematic that contributes to producing galaxy clusters with large
cross sections for strong lensing. The prevalence of line-of-sight structure is
one of several biases in strong lensing clusters that can potentially be folded
into cosmological measurements using galaxy cluster samples. These results also
have implications for current and future studies -- such as the Hubble Space
Telescope Frontier Fields -- that make use of massive galaxy cluster lenses as
precision cosmological telescopes; it is essential that the contribution of
line-of-sight structure be carefully accounted for in the strong lens modeling
of the cluster lenses.

  Emission rather than IGM Heating","  The interaction of TeV photons from blazars with the extragalactic background
light produces a relativistic beam of electron-positron pairs streaming through
the intergalactic medium (IGM). The fate of the beam energy is uncertain. By
means of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study the
non-linear evolution of dilute ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating
through the IGM. We explore a wide range of beam Lorentz factors gamma_b>>1 and
beam-to-plasma density ratios alpha<<1, so that our results can be extrapolated
to the extreme parameters of blazar-induced beams (gamma_b~10^6 and
alpha~10^(-15), for the most powerful blazars). For cold beams, we show that
the oblique instability governs the early stages of evolution, but its
exponential growth terminates - due to self-heating of the beam in the
transverse direction - when only a negligible fraction
~(alpha/gamma_b)^(1/3)~10^(-7) of the beam energy has been transferred to the
IGM plasma. Further relaxation of the beam proceeds through quasi-longitudinal
modes, until the momentum dispersion in the direction of propagation saturates
at DeltaP_{b,parallel}/gamma_b m_e c ~ 0.2. This corresponds to a fraction ~10%
of the beam energy being ultimately transferred to the IGM plasma, irrespective
of gamma_b or alpha. If the initial dispersion in beam momentum satisfies
DeltaP_{b,parallel}/gamma_b m_e c > 0.2 (as typically expected for
blazar-induced beams), the fraction of beam energy deposited into the IGM is
much smaller than ~10%. It follows that at least ~90% of the beam energy is
still available to power the GeV emission produced by inverse Compton
up-scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background by the beam pairs.

astrophysically relevant application using the M1 radiation closure within a
new three-dimensional (3D) general relativistic (GR) radiation (R)
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) massively parallel code called HARMRAD. Our 3D
GRRMHD simulation of super-Eddington accretion (about $20$ times Eddington)
onto a rapidly rotating BH (dimensionless spin $j=0.9375$) shows sustained
non-axisymmemtric disk turbulence, a persistent electromagnetic jet driven by
the Blandford-Znajek effect, and a total radiative output consistently near the
Eddington rate. The total accretion efficiency is of order $20\%$, the
large-scale electromagnetic jet efficiency is of order $10\%$, and the total
radiative efficiency that reaches large distances remains low at only order
$1\%$. However, the radiation jet and the electromagnetic jet both emerge from
a geometrically beamed polar region, with super-Eddington isotropic equivalent
luminosities. Such simulations with HARMRAD can enlighten the role of BH spin
vs.\ disks in launching jets, help determine the origin of spectral and
temporal states in x-ray binaries, help understand how tidal disruption events
(TDEs) work, provide an accurate horizon-scale flow structure for M87 and other
active galactic nuclei (AGN), and isolate whether AGN feedback is driven by
radiation or by an electromagnetic, thermal, or kinetic wind/jet. For example,
the low radiative efficiency and weak BH spin-down rate from our simulation

  Multi-Epoch Spectroscopy. II. The Population with Kinematically Offset Broad
  Balmer Emission Lines","  A small fraction of quasars have long been known to show bulk velocity
offsets in the broad Balmer lines with respect to the systemic redshift of the
host galaxy. Models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line region
gas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (BHs), orbital motion of
massive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (BBHs), or recoil BHs, but single-epoch
spectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. The line-of-sight
(LOS) radial velocity (RV) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring can
be used to test the BBH hypothesis. We have selected a sample of 399 quasars
with offset broad H-beta lines from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog, and have
conducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. Combined with the
existing SDSS spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the LOS RV
shifts of broad H-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years to
nearly a decade. Using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%
confidence) radial accelerations in the broad H-beta lines in 24 of the 50
objects. We suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc BBH candidates,
which show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a second
broad line (either H-alpha or Mg II) without significant changes in the
broad-line profiles. Combining the results on the general quasar population
studied in Paper I, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocity
offset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between two
epochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the time
separation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbital
period of the motion causing the line displacement. We discuss the implications
of our results for the identification of sub-pc BBH candidates in offset-line
quasars and for the constraints on their frequency and orbital parameters.

inferior conjunction, especially at the stationary points, from observatories
on nearly the same meridian but widely differing in latitude. James M.
Gilliss,astronomer at the newly founded U.S. Naval Observatory,
enthusiastically adopted this idea and procured a grant for the young
astronomical community of the United States for an expedition to Chile. There
they were to observe several conjunctions of Venus and oppositions of Mars,
while the accompanying measurements were to be taken at the US Naval
Observatory in Washington D.C. and the Harvard College Observatory at
Cambridge, USA. This expedition was supported by A. v. Humboldt, C.F. Gau{\ss},
J.F. Encke, S.C. Walker, A.D. Bache, B. Peirce and others. From 1849 to 1852
not only were astronomical, but also meteorological and magnetic observations
and measurements recorded, mainly in Santa Lucia close to Santiago, Chile. By
comparing these measurements with those taken simultaneously at other
observatories around the world the solar parallax could be calculated, although
incomplete data from the corresponding northern observatories threatened the
project's success. In retrospect this expedition can be recognized as the
foundation of the Chilean astronomy. The first director of the new National

spectral type M7e). This system is remarkable for its extreme levels of
magnetic activity: it is the most radio-luminous ultracool dwarf (UCD) known,
and here we show that it is also one of the most X-ray luminous UCDs known. We
detect the system in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring
and periodic variability. Analysis of the optical light curve reveals the
simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 $\pm$ 0.0001 and 3.7130
$\pm$ 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential
rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two
signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components:
rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase
with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears
only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a
gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool,
equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational
phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect
nearly continuously. We present an SED of the blended system spanning more than
9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT

due to their motion through the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Deep X-ray
observations reveal the fine-structure of the galaxy's remnant atmosphere and
its gas tail and wake. This fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions
(galaxy potential, initial gas contents, orbit through the host cluster),
orbital stage (early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), and ICM plasma
properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity, magnetic field structure). We aim
to disentangle dynamic and plasma effects in order to use stripped ellipticals
as probes of ICM plasma properties. This first paper of a series investigates
the hydrodynamics of progressive gas stripping by means of inviscid
hydrodynamical simulations. We distinguish a long-lasting initial relaxation
phase and a quasi-steady stripping phase. During quasi-steady stripping, the
ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere resembles the flow around solid bodies,
including a `deadwater' region in the near wake. Gas is stripped from the
remnant atmosphere predominantly at its sides via Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. The downstream atmosphere is largely shielded from the ICM wind
and thus shaped into a tail. Observationally, both, this `remnant tail' and the
stripped gas in the wake can appear as a `tail', but only in the wake can
galactic gas mix with the ambient ICM. While the qualitative results are
generic, the simulations presented here are tailored to the Virgo elliptical
galaxy M89 (NGC 4552) for the most direct comparison to observations. Papers II

inviscid gas stripping. Here we study the effect of a Spitzer-like temperature
dependent viscosity corresponding to Reynolds numbers, Re, of 50 to 5000 with
respect to the ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere. Global flow patterns are
independent of viscosity in this Reynolds number range. Viscosity influences
two aspects: In inviscid stripping, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs) at
the sides of the remnant atmosphere lead to observable horns or wings.
Increasing viscosity suppresses KHIs of increasing length scale, and thus
observable horns and wings. Furthermore, in inviscid stripping, stripped
galactic gas can mix with the ambient ICM in the galaxy's wake. This mixing is
suppressed increasingly with increasing viscosity, such that viscously stripped
galaxies have long X-ray bright, cool wakes. We provide mock X-ray images for
different stripping stages and conditions. While these qualitative results are

enclosed gravitating mass (M500=3.8e12+/-1e12 Msun, slightly higher than
NGC\thin 720), and baryon fraction (fb500=0.13+/-0.03). We confirm at 8.2-sigma
the presence of a dark matter (DM) halo consistent with LCDM. Assuming a
Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, our self-consistent, physical model enables
meaningful constraints beyond R500, revealing that most of the baryons are in
the hot gas. Within the virial radius, fb is consistent with the Cosmic mean,
suggesting that the predicted massive, quasi-hydrostatic gas halos may be more
common than previously thought. We confirm that the DM and stars conspire to
produce an approximately powerlaw total mass profile (rho \propto r^-alpha)
that follows the recently discovered scaling relation between alpha and optical
effective radius. Our conclusions are insensitive to modest, observationally
motivated, deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. Finally, after correcting
for the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profile is close to the self-similar

partial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and
applying a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate
how its algorithmic information content is affected when every one of its

improves on the existing Ginzburg - Landau theory for superfluid Fermi gases in
that it is not restricted to temperatures close to the critical temperature.
This is achieved by taking into account long-range fluctuations to all orders.
The results of the present effective field theory compare well with the results

of an effective field theory over Bogoliubov - de Gennes calculations is that
much less computation time is required. In the second part of the paper, we
extend the effective field theory to the case of a two-band superfluid. The
present theory allows us to reveal the presence of two healing lengths in the
two-band superfluids, to analyze the finite-temperature vortex structure in the
BEC-BCS crossover, and to obtain the ground state parameters and spectra of

http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0401v1,"Development and Application of Tools to Characterize Transiting
  Astrophysical Systems","  Since the discovery of the first exoplanets more than 20 years ago, there has
been an increasing need for photometric and spectroscopic models to
characterize these systems. While imaging has been used extensively for Solar
System bodies and extended objects like galaxies, the small angular extent of
typical planetary systems makes it difficult or impossible to resolve them.
Spatially integrated observations like measuring the total brightness or
spectrum, however, can be conducted at a resonable cost. This thesis focuses on
photometric models in the context of transiting systems, which exhibit a number
of phenomena that can be exploited for characterization.
  First, we showcase the popular methods of transiting exoplanet discovery and
characterization by ground based observations on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-27b. We
demonstrate how transits allow us to constrain planetary mass, radius, and
orbital inclination, which would not be possible based only on, for example,
radial velocity measurements.
  Next, we perform reflection spectroscopy on HAT-P-1b, another hot Jupiter,
using the binary companion of the host star as a reference to remove systematic
errors from the signal. Here the transiting nature of the system allows us to
look for the very faint light reflected by the planet.
  We also apply the idea of planetary transits to investigate the feasibility
of transit observations in astrophysical systems of very different scale: stars
in galactic nuclei potentially transiting the accretion disk of the
supermassive black hole in the galactic center.
  Finally, we focus on mapping spots on the stellar surface using transits.
This method has been used for a decade, and helped constrain stellar rotation
or orbital geometry in a number systems. We study starspots on HAT-P-11 to
learn more about stellar rotation and to investigate the size and contrast of
the spots themselves.

  cosmic time","  We study the properties of black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic
time in the Illustris simulation. Illustris is a large scale cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 Mpc)^3 volume with more than
12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models
relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for
redshifts z = 0 - 5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by
Illustris are in very good agreement with the most recent observational
constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of
AGN at z = 0 and 1 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic
range probed. Unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated,
this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon_r <= 0.1,
noting however that in our model radiative efficiencies are degenerate with
black hole feedback efficiencies. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in
broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we predict a larger
number density of faint AGN at high redshifts than currently inferred. We also
study black hole -- host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy
morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes
and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and
star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central
black hole masses or the nuclear AGN activity.

  Accretion Flows. I. Compression-Driven Instabilities and the Electron Heating
  Mechanism","  In systems accreting well below the Eddington rate, the plasma in the
innermost regions of the disk is collisionless and two-temperature, with the
ions hotter than the electrons. Yet, whether a collisionless
faster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature
accretion flows is still an open question. We study the physics of electron
heating during the growth of ion velocity-space instabilities, by means of
multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A large-scale compression
- embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations - continuously amplifies the
field. This constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P_perp > P_parallel, due to
the adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for
ion plasma beta values beta_i ~ 5-30 appropriate for the midplane of
low-luminosity accretion flows, mirror modes dominate if the electron-to-proton
temperature ratio is > 0.2, whereas if it is < 0.2 the ion cyclotron
instability triggers the growth of strong Alfven-like waves, that pitch-angle
scatter the ions to maintain marginal stability. We develop an analytical model
of electron heating during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability, which
we validate with PIC simulations. We find that for cold electrons (beta_e <
m_e/m_i), the electron energy gain is controlled by the magnitude of the
E-cross-B velocity induced by the ion cyclotron waves. This term is independent
of the initial electron temperature, so it provides a solid energy floor even
for electrons starting with extremely low temperatures. On the other hand, the
electron energy gain for beta_e > m_e/m_i - governed by the conservation of the
magnetic moment in the growing fields of the instability - is proportional to
the initial electron temperature. Our results have implications for
two-temperature accretion flows as well as the solar wind and intracluster
plasmas. [abridged]

  Accretion Flows. II. Electron Heating Efficiency as a Function of Flow
  Conditions","  In the innermost regions of low-luminosity accretion flows, including Sgr A*
at the center of our Galaxy, the frequency of Coulomb collisions is so low that
the plasma is two-temperature, with the ions substantially hotter than the
electrons. This paradigm assumes that Coulomb collisions are the only channel
for transferring the ion energy to the electrons. In this work, the second of a
series, we assess the efficiency of electron heating by ion velocity-space
instabilities in collisionless accretion flows. The instabilities are seeded by
the pressure anisotropy induced by magnetic field amplification, coupled to the
adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. Using two-dimensional
(2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we showed in Paper I that if the
electron-to-ion temperature ratio is < 0.2, the ion cyclotron instability is
the dominant mode for values of ion beta_i ~ 5-30 (here, beta_i is the ratio of
ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure), as appropriate for the midplane of
low-luminosity accretion flows. In this work, we employ analytical theory and
1D PIC simulations (with the box aligned with the fastest growing wavevector of
the ion cyclotron mode) to fully characterize how the electron heating
efficiency during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability depends on the
electron-to-proton temperature ratio, the plasma beta, the Alfven speed, the
amplification rate of the mean field (in units of the ion Larmor frequency) and
the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Our findings can be incorporated as a
physically-grounded sub-grid model into global fluid simulations of
low-luminosity accretion flows, thus helping to assess the validity of the
two-temperature assumption.

lenses among the population of low-redshift early-type galaxies. The SINFONI
Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey (SNELLS) uses integral-field infrared
spectroscopy to search for lensed emission line sources behind massive lens
candidates at $z$<0.055. From 27 galaxies observed, we have recovered one
previously-known lens (ESO325-G004) at $z$=0.034, and discovered two new
systems, at $z$=0.031 and $z$=0.052. All three lens galaxies have high velocity
dispersions (\sigma>300 km/s) and \alpha-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]>0.3). From
the lensing configurations we derive total J-band mass-to-light ratios of
1.8$\pm$0.1, 2.1$\pm$0.1 and 1.9$\pm$0.2 within the $\sim$2 kpc Einstein
radius. Correcting for estimated dark-matter contributions, and comparing to
stellar population models with a Milky Way (Kroupa) initial mass function
(IMF), we determine the ""mass excess factor"", \alpha. Assuming the lens
galaxies have ""old"" stellar populations (10$\pm$1 Gyr), the average IMF mass
factor is $\langle\alpha\rangle$=1.10$\pm$0.08$\pm$0.10, where the first error
is random and the second is systematic. If we instead fit the stellar
populations from 6dF optical survey spectra, all three galaxies are consistent
with being old, but the age errors are 3-4 Gyr, due to limited signal-to-noise.
The IMF constraints are therefore looser in this case, with
$\langle\alpha\rangle$ = $1.23^{+0.16}_{-0.13}\pm{0.10}$. Our results are thus
consistent with a Kroupa IMF (\alpha=1.00) on average, and strongly reject very
heavy IMFs with \alpha>2. A Salpeter IMF (\alpha=1.55) is inconsistent at the
3.5$\sigma$ level if the galaxies are old, but cannot be excluded using age
constraints derived from the currently-available optical spectra.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03483v1,The low-frequency radio catalog of flat spectrum sources,"  A well known property of the gamma-ray sources detected by COS-B in the
1970s, by the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory in the 1990s and recently by the
Fermi observations is the presence of radio counterparts, in particular for
those associated to extragalactic objects. This observational evidence is the
basis of the radio-gamma-ray connection established for the class of active
galactic nuclei known as blazars. In particular, the main spectral property of
the radio counterparts associated with gamma-ray blazars is that they show a
flat spectrum in the GHz frequency range. Our recent analysis dedicated to
search blazar-like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentified
gamma-ray sources (UGSs) allowed us to extend the radio-gamma-ray connection in
the MHz regime. We also showed that below 1 GHz blazars maintain flat radio
spectra. Thus on the basis of these new results, we assembled a low-frequency
radio catalog of flat spectrum sources built by combining the radio
observations of the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and of the
Westerbork in the southern hemisphere (WISH) catalog with those of the NRAO
Very Large Array Sky survey (NVSS). This could be used in the future to search
for new, unknown blazar-like counterparts of the gamma-ray sources. First we
found NVSS counterparts of WSRT radio sources and then we selected flat
spectrum radio sources according to a new spectral criterion specifically
defined for radio observations performed below 1 GHz. We also described the
main properties of the catalog listing 28358 radio sources and their logN-logS
distributions. Finally a comparison with with the Green Bank 6-cm radio source
catalog has been performed to investigate the spectral shape of the
low-frequency flat spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies.

outburst and once during the decay, finding good agreement in the spectral
shape between the observations. We describe the continuum using a powerlaw with
a Fermi-Dirac cutoff at high energies. Cep X-4 has a very strong cyclotron
resonant scattering feature (CRSF) around 30 keV. A simple absorption-like line
with a Gaussian optical depth or a pseudo-Lorentzian profile both fail to
describe the shape of the CRSF accurately, leaving significant deviations at
the red side of the line. We characterize this asymmetry with a second
absorption feature around 19 keV. The line energy of the CRSF, which is not
influenced by the addition of this feature, shows a small but significant
positive luminosity dependence. With luminosities between (1-6)e36 erg/s, Cep
X-4 is below the theoretical limit where such a correlation is expected. This
behavior is similar to Vela X-1 and we discuss parallels between the two

surrounded by disk/envelopes is very high ($\sim$85%) compared to other star
forming regions of similar age (1-2 Myr), but includes some uncertain
corrections for diskless YSOs. Yet, a possibly high disk fraction together with
the fact that 1/3 of the cloud mass has a gas surface density above the

of the IGR sources: IGR J14091-6108, IGR J18088-2741, and IGR J18381-0924. The
first two have very hard spectra in the Chandra band that can be described by a
power-law with photon indices of Gamma = 0.6+/-0.4 and -0.7(+0.4)(-0.3),
respectively (90% confidence errors are given), and both have a unique near-IR
counterpart consistent with the Chandra position. IGR J14091-6108 also displays
a strong iron line and a relatively low X-ray luminosity, and we argue that the
most likely source type is a Cataclysmic Variable (CV), although we do not
completely rule out the possibility of a High Mass X-ray Binary. IGR
J18088-2741 has an optical counterpart with a previously measured 6.84 hr
periodicity, which may be the binary orbital period. We also detect five cycles
of a possible 800-950 s period in the Chandra light curve, which may be the
compact object spin period. We suggest that IGR J18088-2741 is also most likely
a CV. For IGR J18381-0924, the spectrum is intrinsically softer with Gamma =
1.5(+0.5)(-0.4), and it is moderately absorbed, nH = (4+/-1)e22 cm-2. There are
two near-IR sources consistent with the Chandra position, and they are both
classified as galaxies, making it likely that IGR J18381-0924 is an Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN). For the other five IGR sources, we provide lists of
nearby Chandra sources, which may be used along with further observations to
identify the correct counterparts, and we discuss the implications of the low

to gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before
reionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple
arguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in
local abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have
important consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely
metal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost
immediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is
too low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars
may contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in
large carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)
can be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling
abundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard
core-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We
also show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in
these species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are
correlated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local
silicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure
SNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,
preferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)
dust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio
fluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light
element abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust
where they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis.

Way-like halo in four different dark matter models and the cold dark matter
case. Our highest resolution simulation has a particle mass of $2.8\times
10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and a softening length of $72.4\,{\rm pc}$. We demonstrate
that all alternative models have only a negligible impact on large scale
structure formation. On galactic scales, however, the models significantly
affect the structure and abundance of subhaloes due to the combined effects of
small scale primordial damping in the power spectrum and late time
self-interactions. We derive an analytic mapping from the primordial damping
scale in the power spectrum to the cutoff scale in the halo mass function and
the kinetic decoupling temperature. We demonstrate that certain models within
this extended effective framework that can alleviate the too-big-to-fail and
missing satellite problems simultaneously, and possibly the core-cusp problem.
The primordial power spectrum cutoff of our models naturally creates a
diversity in the circular velocity profiles, which is larger than that found
for cold dark matter simulations. We show that the parameter space of models

observations. For example, some models may be challenged by the missing

  in shearing, collisionless plasma","  The nonlinear state of a high-beta collisionless plasma is investigated when
an imposed linear shear amplifies or diminishes a uniform magnetic field,
driving pressure anisotropies and hence firehose/mirror instabilities. The
evolution of the resulting microscale turbulence is considered when the shear
is switched off or reversed after one shear time (mimicking local behaviour of
a macroscopic flow), so a new macroscale configuration is superimposed on the
microscale state left behind by the previous one. There is a threshold value of
plasma beta: when $\beta\ll\Omega/S$ (ion cyclotron frequency/shear rate), the
emergence of firehose/mirror fluctuations driven unstable by shear and their
disappearance when the shear is removed/reversed are quasi-instantaneous
compared to the shear time, viz., the decay time of these fluctuations is
$\sim\beta/\Omega \ll 1/S$ (this result follows from the free decay of the
fluctuations being constrained by the same marginal-stability thresholds as
their growth). In contrast, when $\beta\gtrsim\Omega/S$ (""ultra-high"" beta),
the old microscale state can only be removed on the shear timescale. In this
regime, driven firehose fluctuations grow secularly to order-unity amplitudes,
compensating for the decay of the mean field and so pinning pressure anisotropy
at marginal stability with no appreciable scattering of particles---which is
unlike what happens at moderate $\beta$. When the shear reverses, the shearing
away of this firehose turbulence compensates for the increase in the mean field
and thus prevents growth of the pressure anisotropy, stopping the system from
going mirror-unstable. Therefore, at ultra-high beta, the system stays close to
the firehose threshold, the mirror instability is largely suppressed, while the
mean magnetic energy barely changes at all. Implications for plasma dynamo and
thus the origin of cosmic magnetism are discussed.

black holes (SMBHs) brighten galactic nuclei and reveal a population of
otherwise dormant black holes. Adopting event rates from the literature, we aim
to establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the TDE number counts
and their observable signals. We pay particular attention to two types of TDEs
which are expected to be observable out to high redshifts, namely (i) jetted
TDEs whose luminosity is boosted by relativistic beaming, and (ii) TDEs around
binary black holes. We show that the brightest (jetted) TDEs are expected to be
produced by massive black hole binaries if the occupancy of intermediate mass
black holes (IMBHs) in low mass galaxies is high. The same binary population
will also provide gravitational wave sources for eLISA. In addition, we find
that the shape of the X-ray luminosity function of TDEs strongly depends on the
occupancy of IMBHs and could be used to constrain scenarios of SMBH formation.
Finally, we make predictions for the expected number of TDEs observed by future
X-ray telescopes as a function of their sensitivity limits. We find that an
instrument which is 50 times more sensitive than the Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT) on board the Swift satellite is expected to trigger ~10 times more events
than BAT with 50% of the events coming from z>2. Because of their long decay
times, high-redshift TDEs can be mistaken for fixed point sources in deep field
surveys such as the 4Ms survey with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and targeted
observations of the same deep field with year-long intervals could reveal TDEs.
If the occupation fraction of IMBHs is high, 6-20 TDEs are expected in each
deep field observed by a telescope 50 times more sensitive than Chandra.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01475v3,"Searching for giga-Jansky fast radio bursts from the Milky Way with a
  global array of low-cost radio receivers","  If fast radio bursts (FRBs) originate from galaxies at cosmological
distances, then their all-sky rate implies that the Milky Way may host an FRB
on average once every 30-1500 years. If FRBs repeat for decades or centuies, a
local FRB could be active now. A typical Galactic FRB would produce a
millisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the
radio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell
phones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global
array of low-cost radio receivers. One possibility is to use the ~1GHz
communication channel in cellular phones through a Citizens-Science
downloadable application. Participating phones would continuously listen for
and record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a
central data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all
participants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from
an astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times
reported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,
potentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating
at diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield
the dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within
the Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz
FM-radio receivers present in cell phones for an FRB search at lower
frequencies. Alternatively, numerous ""software-defined radio"" (SDR) devices,
costing ~$10 US each, could be plugged into USB ports of personal computers
around the world (particularly in radio quiet regions) to establish the global
network of receivers.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04627v2,Electron and proton heating in trans-relativistic magnetic reconnection,"  Hot collisionless accretion flows, such as the one in Sgr A$^{*}$ at our
Galactic center, provide a unique setting for the investigation of magnetic
reconnection. Here, protons are non-relativistic while electrons can be
ultra-relativistic. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations,
we investigate electron and proton heating in the outflows of
trans-relativistic reconnection (i.e., $\sigma_w\sim 0.1-1$, where the
magnetization $\sigma_w$ is the ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy
density). For both electrons and protons, we find that heating at high
$\beta_{\rm i}$ (here, $\beta_{\rm i}$ is the ratio of proton thermal pressure
to magnetic pressure) is dominated by adiabatic compression ('adiabatic
heating'), while at low $\beta_{\rm i}$ it is accompanied by a genuine increase
in entropy ('irreversible heating'). For our fiducial $\sigma_w=0.1$, the
irreversible heating efficiency at $\beta_{\rm i}\lesssim 1$ is nearly
independent of the electron-to-proton temperature ratio $T_{\rm e}/T_{\rm i}$
(which we vary from $0.1$ up to $1$), and it asymptotes to $\sim 2\%$ of the
inflowing magnetic energy in the low-$\beta_{\rm i}$ limit. Protons are heated
more efficiently than electrons at low and moderate $\beta_{\rm i}$ (by a
factor of $\sim7$), whereas the electron and proton heating efficiencies become
comparable at $\beta_{\rm i}\sim 2$ if $T_{\rm e}/T_{\rm i}=1$, when both
species start already relativistically hot. We find comparable heating
efficiencies between the two species also in the limit of relativistic
reconnection ($\sigma_w\gtrsim 1$). Our results have important implications for
the two-temperature nature of collisionless accretion flows, and may provide
the sub-grid physics needed in general relativistic MHD simulations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04892v2,"Towards Accurate Modelling of Galaxy Clustering on Small Scales: Testing
  the Standard $Œõ\mathrm{CDM}$ + Halo Model","  Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can
elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately,
the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models
statistically. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small
scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo
connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the
""accurate"" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful
treatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling
approach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional
two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard
$\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies.
Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity
function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model
fits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding
group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly
tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the
adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the
cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried
(Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity
galaxies, but exhibits a 2.3$\sigma$ tension with the clustering of luminous
galaxies, thus providing evidence that the ""standard"" halo model needs to be
extended. This work opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo
model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.

  Decisions and the GDPR","  There has been much discussion of the right to explanation in the EU General
Data Protection Regulation, and its existence, merits, and disadvantages.
Implementing a right to explanation that opens the black box of algorithmic
decision-making faces major legal and technical barriers. Explaining the
functionality of complex algorithmic decision-making systems and their
rationale in specific cases is a technically challenging problem. Some
explanations may offer little meaningful information to data subjects, raising
questions around their value. Explanations of automated decisions need not
hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function.
Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued,
explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box.
Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than
merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations
according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support. From the
perspective of individuals affected by automated decision-making, we propose
three aims for explanations: (1) to inform and help the individual understand
why a particular decision was reached, (2) to provide grounds to contest the
decision if the outcome is undesired, and (3) to understand what would need to
change in order to receive a desired result in the future, based on the current
decision-making model. We assess how each of these goals finds support in the
GDPR. We suggest data controllers should offer a particular type of
explanation, unconditional counterfactual explanations, to support these three
aims. These counterfactual explanations describe the smallest change to the
world that can be made to obtain a desirable outcome, or to arrive at the
closest possible world, without needing to explain the internal logic of the
system.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05261v1,The evolution of the mass-metallicity relation in IllustrisTNG,"  The coevolution of galaxies and their metal content serves as an important
test for galaxy feedback models. We analyze the distribution and evolution of
metals within the IllustrisTNG simulation suite with a focus on the gas-phase
mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that the IllustrisTNG model broadly
reproduces the slope and normalization evolution of the MZR across the redshift
range $0<z<2$ and mass range $10^9 < M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot < 10^{10.5}$. We make
predictions for the high redshift ($2<z<10$) metal content of galaxies which is
described by a gradual decline in the normalization of the metallicity with an
average high redshift ($z>2$) evolution fit by $\mathrm{d\;log(Z)}/\mathrm{dz}
\approx - 0.064$. Our simulations indicate that the metal retention efficiency
of the interstellar medium (ISM) is low: a majority of gas-phase metals ($\sim$
85 per cent at $z=0$) live outside of the ISM, either in an extended gas disk,
the circumgalactic medium, or outside the halo. Nevertheless, the redshift
evolution in the simulated MZR normalization is driven by the higher gas
fractions of high redshift galaxies, not by changes to the metal retention
efficiency. The scatter in the simulated MZR contains a clear correlation with
the gas-mass or star formation rate of the system, in agreement with the
observed fundamental metallicity relation. The scatter in the MZR is driven by
a competition between periods of enrichment- and accretion-dominated
metallicity evolution. We expect that while the normalization of the MZR
declines with redshift, the strength of the correlation between metallicity and
gas-mass at fixed stellar mass is not a strong function of redshift. Our
results indicate that the ""regulator"" style models are best suited for
simultaneously explaining the shape, redshift evolution, and existence of
correlated scatter with gas fraction about the MZR.

infer that VCC 1287 has an old ($\gtrsim7.7$ Gyr) and surprisingly metal-poor
($[Z/Z_{\odot}]\lesssim-1.0$) stellar population, even after marginalizing over
uncertainties on diffuse interstellar dust. In contrast, the field UDG DGSAT I
shows evidence of being younger than the Virgo UDG, with an extended star
formation history and an age posterior extending down to $\sim3$ Gyr. The
stellar metallicity of DGSAT I is sub-solar but higher than that of the Virgo
UDG, with $[Z/Z_{\odot}]=-0.63^{+0.35}_{-0.62}$; in the case of exactly zero
diffuse interstellar dust, DGSAT I may even have solar metallicity. With VCC
1287 and several Coma UDGs, a general picture is emerging where cluster UDGs

a stellar feedback-induced expansion scenario. In the future, our approach can
be applied to a large and diverse sample of UDGs down to faint surface
brightness limits, with the goal of constraining their stellar ages, stellar
metallicities, and circumstellar and diffuse interstellar dust content.

reionization history between cold dark matter (CDM) and an alternative
self-interacting dark matter model based on the recently developed ETHOS
framework that alleviates the small-scale CDM challenges within the Local

simulations (a 36~Mpc$^3$ volume with gas cell mass of
$\sim10^5\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and minimum gas softening of $\sim180$~pc) within
ETHOS to date -- plus a CDM counterpart -- to quantify the abundance of
galaxies at high redshift and their impact on reionization. We find that ETHOS
predicts galaxies with higher ultraviolet (UV) luminosities than their CDM
counterparts and a faster build-up of the faint end of the UV luminosity
function. These effects, however, make the optical depth to reionization less
sensitive to the power spectrum cut-off: the ETHOS model differs from the CDM
$\tau$ value by only 10 per cent and is consistent with Planck limits if the
effective escape fraction of UV photons is 0.1-0.5. We conclude that current
observations of high-redshift luminosity functions cannot differentiate between
ETHOS and CDM models, but deep JWST surveys of strongly-lensed, inherently
faint galaxies have the potential to test non-CDM models that offer attractive
solutions to CDM's Local Group problems.

release 9 to provide first epoch photometry for objects in the Gaia source
catalogue. We use a version of the catalogue containing $245\,316$ stars with
all phase space coordinates within a heliocentric distance of $\sim 10$ kpc. We
devise a method to assess the significance of halo substructures based on their
clustering in velocity space. The two most substantial structures are multiple
wraps of a stream which has undergone considerable phase mixing (S1, with 94
members) and a kinematically cold stream (S2, with 61 members). The member
stars of S1 have a median position of ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.12, -0.22, 2.75$) kpc and
a median metallicity of [Fe/H] $= -1.78$. The stars of S2 have median
coordinates ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.66, 0.30, 0.77$) kpc and a median metallicity of
[Fe/H] $= -1.91$. They lie in velocity space close to some of the stars in the
stream reported by Helmi et al. (1999). By modelling, we estimate that both
structures had progenitors with virial masses $\approx 10^{10} M_\odot$ and
infall times $\gtrsim 9$ Gyr ago. Using abundance matching, these correspond to
stellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^7 M_\odot$. These are somewhat larger
than the masses inferred through the mass-metallicity relation by factors of 5
to 15. Additionally, we identify two further substructures (S3 and S4 with 55
and 40 members) and two clusters or moving groups (C1 and C2 with 24 and 12)
members. In all 6 cases, clustering in kinematics is found to correspond to
clustering in both configuration space and metallicity, adding credence to the

feature (~1080 km/s) at an observed wavelength of 1240 A. Interpreting this as
HI Ly alpha, in the rest frame of PG1211+143 (z=0.0809), this corresponds to an

agreement with observational constraints than its predecessor, Illustris. TNG
also predicts an enhancement of the dark matter mass within the 3D stellar
half-mass radius ($r_\mathrm{half}$; $M_\mathrm{200c} =
10^{10}-10^{13}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, $z \le2$) compared to its dark matter only

be dominated by dark matter within their inner regions, with
$f_\mathrm{DM}(<r_\mathrm{half})\gtrsim0.5$ at all masses and with a minimum
for MW-mass galaxies. The 1$\sigma$ scatter is $\lesssim$ 10~per~cent at all

e.g. 40 per cent from the SLUGGS survey. TNG agrees with the majority of the
observationally inferred values for elliptical galaxies once a consistent IMF
is adopted (Chabrier) and the DMFs are measured within the same apertures. The
DMFs measured within $r_\mathrm{half}$ increase towards lower redshifts: this

considering, in addition to spherically-averaged profiles, local Q-estimates

dictated by the triaxial structure of the halo, Q_i(r'); and by carefully
removing substructures in order to focus on the profile of the smooth halo,

agreement with the predictions from Bertschinger's spherical secondary-infall

virialized regions, but departures from a power-law occur near r_{200} because
of the proximity of this radius to the location of the first shell crossing -
the shock radius in the case of a collisional fluid. Particles there have not
yet fully virialized, and so Q departs from the inner power-law profile. Our
results imply that the power-law nature of $Q$ profiles only applies to the
inner regions and cannot be used to predict accurately the structure of CDM
halos beyond their characteristic scale radius.

Explorer observation of the rho variability class in the microquasar GRS
1915+105. The rho cycle displays a high-amplitude, double-peaked flare that
recurs roughly every 50 s, and is sometimes referred to as the ""heartbeat""
oscillation. The spectral and timing properties of the oscillation are
consistent with the radiation pressure instability and the evolution of a local
Eddington limit in the inner disk. We exploit strong variations in the X-ray
continuum, iron emission lines, and the accretion disk wind to probe the
accretion geometry over nearly six orders of magnitude in distance from the
black hole. At small scales (1-10 R_g), we detect a burst of bremsstrahlung
emission that appears to occur when a portion of the inner accretion disk
evaporates due to radiation pressure. Jet activity, as inferred from the
appearance of a short X-ray hard state, seems to be limited to times near
minimum luminosity, with a duty cycle of ~10%. On larger scales (1e5-1e6 R_g)
we use detailed photoionization arguments to track the relationship between the
fast X-ray variability and the accretion disk wind. For the first time, we are
able to show that changes in the broadband X-ray spectrum produce changes in
the structure and density of the accretion disk wind on timescales as short as
5 seconds. These results clearly establish a causal link between the X-ray
oscillations and the disk wind and therefore support the existence of a
disk-jet-wind connection. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the mass loss

  Phenomenon","  Preoccupied with measurement, physics has neglected the need, before anything
can be measured, to recognize what it is that is to be measured. The
recognition of symbols employs a known physical mechanism. The elemental
mechanism-a damped inverted pendulum joined by a driven adjustable pendulum (in
effect a clock)-both recognizes a binary distinction and records a single bit.
Referred to by engineers as a ""clocked flip-flop,"" this paired-pendulum
mechanism pervades scientific investigation. It shapes evidence by imposing
discrete phases of allowable leeway in clock readings; and it generates a
mathematical form of evidence that neither assumes a geometry nor assumes
quantum states, and so separates statements of evidence from further
assumptions required to explain that evidence, whether the explanations are
made in quantum terms or in terms of general relativity. Cleansed of
unnecessary assumptions, these expressions of evidence form a platform on which
to consider the working together of general relativity and quantum theory as
explanatory language for evidence from clock networks, such as the Global
Positioning System. Quantum theory puts Planck's constant into explanations of
the required timing leeway, while explanations of leeway also draw on the
theory of general relativity, prompting the question: does Planck's constant in
the timing leeway put the long known tension between quantum theory and general
relativity in a new light?

  Millimeter-VLBI Closure Phases","  Millimeter wave Very Long Baseline Interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides access
to the emission region surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, on sub-horizon scales. Recently, a closure
phase of 0+-40 degrees was reported on a triangle of Earth-sized baselines
(SMT-CARMA-JCMT) representing a new constraint upon the structure and
orientation of the emission region, independent from those provided by the
previously measured 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes alone. Here, we compare
this to the closure phases associated with a class of physically motivated,
radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, and present predictions for
future mm-VLBI experiments with the developing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
We find that the accretion flow models are capable of producing a wide variety
of closure phases on the SMT-CARMA-JCMT triangle, and thus not all models are
consistent with the recent observations. However, those models that reproduce
the 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes overwhelmingly have SMT-CARMA-JCMT closure
phases between +-30 degrees, and are therefore broadly consistent with all
current mm-VLBI observations. Improving station sensitivity by factors of a
few, achievable by increases in bandwidth and phasing together multiple
antennas at individual sites, should result in physically relevant additional
constraints upon the model parameters and eliminate the current 180 degree
ambiguity on the source orientation. When additional stations are included,
closure phases of order 45--90 degrees are typical. In all cases the EHT will
be able to measure these with sufficient precision to produce dramatic
improvements in the constraints upon the spin of Sgr A*.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3564v1,The Luminosity Profile and Structural Parameters of the Andromeda Galaxy,"  We have constructed an extended composite luminosity profile for the
Andromeda galaxy, M31, and have decomposed it into three basic luminous
structural components: a bulge, a disk and a halo. The dust-free Spitzer/IRAC
imaging and extended spatial coverage of ground-based optical imaging and deep
star counts allow us to map M31's structure from its center to 22 kpc along the
major axis. We apply different decomposition methods for the 1D luminosity
profiles and 2D images. These include non-linear least-squares and Bayesian
Monte-Carlo Markov-chain analyses. The basic photometric model for M31 has a
Sersic bulge with shape index n = 2.2 +/- 0.3 and effective radius R_e = 1.0
+/- 0.2 kpc, a dust-free exponential disk of scale length R_d = 5.3 +/- 0.5
kpc; the parameter errors reflect the range between various decomposition
methods. The bulge parameter, n, is rather insensitive to bandpass effects and
its value suggests a first rapid formation via mergers followed by secular
growth from the disk. The M31 halo has a 2D power-law index ~ -2.5 +/- 0.2. We
find that the M31 bulge light is mostly dominant over the range R_minor < 1.2
kpc. The disk takes over in the range 1.2 kpc < R_minor < 9 kpc, whereas the
halo dominates at R_minor > 9 kpc. The stellar nucleus, bulge, disk, and halo
components each contribute roughly 0.05%, 23%, 73% and 4% of the total light of
M31 out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. Nominal errors for the structural
parameters of the M31 bulge, disk and halo amount to 20%. If M31 and the Milky
Way are at all typical, faint stellar halos should be routinely detected in
galaxy surveys reaching below mu_i ~ 27 mag/arcsec^2. We stress that our
results rely on this photometric analysis alone. Structural parameters may
change when other fundamental constraints, such as those provided by abundance
gradients and stellar kinematics, are considered simultaneously (Abridged).

lacking. We have performed X-ray and radio observations of seven UCDs in a
narrow range of spectral type (M6.5-M9.5) but spanning a wide range of
projected rotational velocities (v sin i ~ 3-40 km/s). We have also analyzed
unpublished archival Chandra observations of four additional objects. All of

present a database of UCDs with both radio and X-ray measurements and consider
the data in light of the so-called G\""udel-Benz relation (GBR) between magnetic
activity in these bands. Some UCDs have very bright radio emission and faint
X-ray emission compared to what would be expected for rapid rotators, while
others show opposite behavior. We show that UCDs would still be
radio-over-luminous relative to the GBR even if their X-ray emission were at
standard rapid-rotator ""saturation"" levels. Recent results from Zeeman-Doppler
imaging and geodynamo simulations suggest that rapidly-rotating UCDs may harbor
a bistable dynamo that supports either a stronger, axisymmetric magnetic field
or a weaker, non-axisymmetric field. We suggest that the data can be explained
in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field
objects are radio-over-luminous and X-ray-under-luminous, possibly because of a
population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously
replenished by low-energy reconnection events.

relationship with rotation with an increase until a ""saturation"" level and a
moderate decrease in activity in the very fastest rotators (""supersaturation"").
While X-ray data have suggested that this relationship is strongly violated in
ultracool dwarfs (UCDs; spectral type >M7), the limited number of X-ray
detections has prevented firm conclusions. In this paper, we analyze the X-ray
activity-rotation relation in 38 ultracool dwarfs. Our sample represents the
largest catalog of X-ray active ultracool dwarfs to date, including seven new

paper. We identify a substantial number of rapidly-rotating UCDs with X-ray
activity extending two orders of magnitude below the expected saturation level
and measure a ""supersaturation""-type anticorrelation between rotation and X-ray
activity. The scatter in UCD X-ray activity at a fixed rotation is ~3 times
larger than that in earlier-type stars. We discuss several mechanisms that have
been proposed to explain the data, including centrifugal stripping of the
corona, and find them to be inconsistent with the observed trends. Instead, we
suggest that an additional parameter correlated with both X-ray activity and
rotation is responsible for the observed effects. Building on the results of
Zeeman-Doppler imaging of UCD magnetic fields and our companion study of
radio/X-ray flux ratios, we argue that this parameter is the magnetic field

of two dynamo modes that produce distinct topologies.

curves by Basri et al. (2011), with measurements of radial velocity (RV)
root-mean-square (RMS) variations of all California Planet Search overlap
stars. We newly derive rotation periods from the Kepler light curves for all of
the stars in our study sample. The RV variations reported herein range from
less than 4 m/s to 135 m/s, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric
variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for
chromospherically ""quiet"" stars. Despite the small size of our sample, we find
with high statistical significance that the RV RMS manifests strongly in the
Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in RV have a
greater number of frequency components in the light curve. We also find that
spot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the
observed RV variations by factors of ~2--1000, likely because the low level
photometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in
simple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler
light curves, dominated by a single relatively high amplitude component of
variability. Finally, we demonstrate that the RV RMS behavior of our sample can
be explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagram
introduced by Bastien et al. (2013). We use this diagram to derive the surface
gravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved off
the main-sequence. More generally, we find that the stars with the largest RV

these observations provide the novel opportunity to test the applicability of
the Kerr metric to astrophysical black holes. Here we present the first

demonstrate the feasibility of testing the no-hair theorem by constraining the
quadrupolar deviation from the Kerr metric with existing EHT data. Equally
important, we find that the disk inclination and spin orientation angles are
robust to the inclusion of additional parameters, providing confidence in
previous estimations assuming the Kerr metric based upon EHT observations.
However, at present the limits upon potential modifications of the Kerr metric

of bursts have densities of less than 1 cm^-3. We investigate trends between

spectroscopic observations of Hydra I with SDSS archival spectroscopic
observations to quantify Hydra I's present-day chemodynamical properties, and
to infer whether it originated as a star cluster or dwarf galaxy. While
previous work using shallow SDSS imaging assumed a standard old, metal-poor
stellar population, our deeper DECam imaging reveals that Hydra~I has a thin,

significant fraction of its rest mass energy when its periapse is comparable to
its tidal radius. Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted
and injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the
black hole, with the fastest material moving at $\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,
we present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams
(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding
gas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that
hydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the
densest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs
travel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with
distance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the
ambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This
sudden injection of $\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a
Sedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)
in energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic
rays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the
molecular clouds surrounding a black hole. We estimate that a few of these UDRs
might be present within a couple degrees of the Galactic Center masquerading as
SNRs, and that the UDR scenario is a plausible explanation for Sgr A East.

accretion rate. Here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized X-ray

Variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas is

factor. Modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second are
observed, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set by
variability. The gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,

relativistic magnetic reconnection can naturally account for the formation of
quasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic
fields. Our simulations extend to unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial
scales, so we can capture the asymptotic physics independently of the initial
setup. We characterize the properties of the plasmoids that are continuously
generated as a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process: they are
in rough energy equipartition between particles and magnetic fields; the upper
energy cutoff of the plasmoid particle spectrum is proportional to the plasmoid
width w, corresponding to a Larmor radius ~0.2 w; the plasmoids grow in size at
~0.1 of the speed of light, with most of the growth happening while they are
still non-relativistic (first they grow); their growth is suppressed once they
get accelerated to relativistic speeds by the field line tension, up to the
Alfven speed (then they go). The largest plasmoids, whose typical recurrence
interval is ~2.5 L/c, reach a characteristic size w ~ 0.2 L independently of
the system length L, they have nearly isotropic particle distributions and they

galaxy (BCG), and an NFW dark matter (DM) halo, we obtain good descriptions of
the projected radial profiles of ICM emissivity and temperature. The BCG
stellar mass is clearly detected with M_star/L_K = 0.61 +/- 0.11 solar,
consistent with stellar population synthesis models for a Milky-Way IMF. We
obtain a halo concentration, c_200 =8.4 +/- 1.0, and virial mass, M_200 = 7.9
+/- 0.6 x 10^13 M_sun. For its mass, the inferred concentration is larger than
most relaxed halos produced in cosmological simulations with Planck parameters,
consistent with RXJ1159+5531 forming earlier than the general halo population.
The baryon fraction at r_200, f_b,200 = 0.134 +/- 0.007, is slightly below the
Planck value (0.155) for the universe. When we account for the stellar baryons
associated with non-central galaxies and the uncertain intracluster light,
f_b,200 increases by ~0.015, consistent with the cosmic value. Performing our
analysis in the context of MOND still requires a large DM fraction (85.0% +/-
2.5% at r=100 kpc) similar to that obtained using the standard Newtonian
approach. The detection of a plausible stellar BCG mass component distinct from
the NFW DM halo in the total gravitational potential suggests that ~10^14 M_sun
represents the mass scale above which dissipation is unimportant in the
formation of the central regions of galaxy clusters. (Abridged)

  vertically-stratified, Boussinesq flow: Linear analysis","  The linear stability of three-dimensional (3D) vortices in rotating,
stratified flows has been studied by analyzing the non-hydrostatic inviscid
Boussinesq equations. We have focused on a widely-used model of geophysical and
astrophysical vortices, which assumes an axisymmetric Gaussian structure for
pressure anomalies in the horizontal and vertical directions. For a range of
Rossby number ($-0.5 < Ro < 0.5$) and Burger number ($0.02 < Bu < 2.3$)
relevant to observed long-lived vortices, the growth rate and spatial structure
of the most unstable eigenmodes have been numerically calculated and presented
as a function of $Ro-Bu$. We have found neutrally-stable vortices only over a
small region of the $Ro-Bu$ parameter space: cyclones with $Ro \sim 0.02-0.05$
and $Bu \sim 0.85-0.95$. However, we have also found that anticyclones in
general have slower growth rates compared to cyclones. In particular, the
growth rate of the most unstable eigenmode for anticyclones in a large region
of the parameter space (e.g., $Ro<0$ and $0.5 \lesssim Bu \lesssim 1.3$) is
slower than $50$ turn-around times of the vortex (which often corresponds to
several years for ocean eddies). For cyclones, the region with such slow growth
rates is confined to $0<Ro<0.1$ and $0.5 \lesssim Bu \lesssim 1.3$. While most
calculations have been done for $f/\bar{N}=0.1$ (where $f$ and $\bar{N}$ are
the Coriolis and background Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequencies), we have
numerically verified and explained analytically, using non-dimensionalized
equations, the insensitivity of the results to reducing $f/\bar{N}$ to the more
ocean-relevant value of $0.01$. The results of this paper provide a
steppingstone to study the more complicated problems of the stability of
geophysical (e.g., those in the atmospheres of giant planets) and astrophysical
vortices (in accretion disks).

Galaxy is challenging because of high-extinction and crowding, which make the
identification of individual sources more difficult. IGR J18293-1213 is part of
the population of persistent sources which have been discovered by the INTEGRAL

performed on 2015 September 11. We detected three eclipsing intervals in the

$\Delta t = 30.8^{+6.3}_{-0.0}$ min, and the orbital period of the system, $T =

a putative spin modulation, the orbital period and the hard thermal

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations on a moving mesh, which maintains the
divergence-free condition on the magnetic field to machine-precision. Our CT
scheme uses an unstructured representation of the magnetic vector potential,
making the numerical method simple and computationally efficient. The scheme is
implemented in the moving mesh code Arepo. We demonstrate the performance of
the approach with simulations of driven MHD turbulence, a magnetized disc
galaxy, and a cosmological volume with primordial magnetic field. We compare
the outcomes of these experiments to those obtained with a previously
implemented Powell divergence-cleaning scheme. While CT and the Powell
technique yield similar results in idealized test problems, some differences
are seen in situations more representative of astrophysical flows. In the
turbulence simulations, the Powell cleaning scheme artificially grows the mean
magnetic field, while CT maintains this conserved quantity of ideal MHD. In the
disc simulation, CT gives slower magnetic field growth rate and saturates to
equipartition between the turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic energy, whereas
Powell cleaning produces a dynamically dominant magnetic field. Such difference
has been observed in adaptive-mesh refinement codes with CT and
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics codes with divergence-cleaning. In the
cosmological simulation, both approaches give similar magnetic amplification,
but Powell exhibits more cell-level noise. CT methods in general are more
accurate than divergence-cleaning techniques, and, when coupled to a moving
mesh can exploit the advantages of automatic spatial/temporal adaptivity and
reduced advection errors, allowing for improved astrophysical MHD simulations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02714v2,Simulating the dust content of galaxies: successes and failures,"  We present full volume cosmological simulations using the moving-mesh code
AREPO to study the coevolution of dust and galaxies. We extend the dust model
in AREPO to include thermal sputtering of grains and investigate the evolution
of the dust mass function, the cosmic distribution of dust beyond the
interstellar medium, and the dependence of dust-to-stellar mass ratio on
galactic properties. The simulated dust mass function is well-described by a
Schechter fit and lies closest to observations at $z = 0$. The radial scaling
of projected dust surface density out to distances of $10 \, \text{Mpc}$ around
galaxies with magnitudes $17 < i < 21$ is similar to that seen in Sloan Digital
Sky Survey data, albeit with a lower normalisation. At $z = 0$, the predicted
dust density of $\Omega_\text{dust} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-6}$ lies in the
range of $\Omega_\text{dust}$ values seen in low-redshift observations. We find
that dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass for galaxies
living along the star formation main sequence. Moreover, we estimate the $850
\, \mu\text{m}$ number density functions for simulated galaxies and analyse the
relation between dust-to-stellar flux and mass ratios at $z = 0$. At high
redshift, our model fails to produce enough dust-rich galaxies, and this
tension is not alleviated by adopting a top-heavy initial mass function. We do
not capture a decline in $\Omega_\text{dust}$ from $z = 2$ to $z = 0$, which
suggests that dust production mechanisms more strongly dependent on star
formation may help to produce the observed number of dusty galaxies near the
peak of cosmic star formation.

  Bursts","  The merger of a neutron star binary may result in the formation of a
rapidly-spinning magnetar. The magnetar can potentially survive for seconds or
longer as a supramassive neutron star before collapsing to a black hole if,
indeed, it collapses at all. During this process, a fraction of the magnetar's
rotational energy of ~10^53 erg is transferred via magnetic spin-down to the
surrounding ejecta. The resulting interaction between the ejecta and the
surrounding circumburst medium powers a >year-long synchrotron radio transient.
We present a search for radio emission with the Very Large Array following nine
short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at rest-frame times of ~1.3-7.6 years
after the bursts, focusing on those events which exhibit early-time excess
X-ray emission that may signify the presence of magnetars. We place upper
limits of <18-32 microJy on the 6.0 GHz radio emission, corresponding to
spectral luminosities of <(0.05-8.3)x10^39 erg s^-1. Comparing these limits to
the predicted radio emission from a long-lived remnant and incorporating
measurements of the circumburst densities from broad-band modeling of short GRB
afterglows, we rule out a stable magnetar with an energy of 10^53 erg for half
of the events in our sample. A supramassive remnant that injects a lower
rotational energy of 10^52 erg is ruled out for a single event, GRB 050724A.
This study represents the deepest and most extensive search for long-term radio

strong lenses discovered in the SINFONI Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey
(SNELLS). Based on their lensing masses, these ETGs were inferred to have a
stellar initial mass function (IMF) consistent with that of the Milky Way, not
the bottom-heavy IMF that has been reported as typical for high-$\sigma$ ETGs
based on lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis techniques. We
use these unique systems to test the consistency of IMF estimates derived from
different methods. We first estimate the stellar $M_*/L$ using lensing and
stellar dynamics. We then fit high-quality optical spectra of the lenses using
an updated version of the stellar population synthesis models developed by
Conroy & van Dokkum. When examined individually, we find good agreement among
these methods for one galaxy. The other two galaxies show 2-3$\sigma$ tension
with lensing estimates, depending on the dark matter contribution, when
considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 Msol. Allowing a variable low-mass cutoff
or a nonparametric form of the IMF reduces the tension among the IMF estimates
to $<2\sigma$. There is moderate evidence for a reduced number of low-mass
stars in the SNELLS spectra, but no such evidence in a composite spectrum of
matched-$\sigma$ ETGs drawn from the SDSS. Such variation in the form of the
IMF at low stellar masses (m <~ 0.03 Msol), if present, could reconcile
lensing/dynamical and spectroscopic IMF estimates for the SNELLS lenses and
account for their lighter $M_*/L$ relative to the mean matched-$\sigma$ ETG. We
provide the spectra used in this study to facilitate future comparisons.

  for neural circuit reconstruction using FFT signal whitening","  The detailed reconstruction of neural anatomy for connectomics studies
requires a combination of resolution and large three-dimensional data capture
provided by serial section electron microscopy (ssEM). The convergence of high
throughput ssEM imaging and improved tissue preparation methods now allows ssEM
capture of complete specimen volumes up to cubic millimeter scale. The
resulting multi-terabyte image sets span thousands of serial sections and must
be precisely registered into coherent volumetric forms in which neural circuits
can be traced and segmented. This paper introduces a Signal Whitening Fourier
Transform Image Registration approach (SWiFT-IR) under development at the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and its use to align mouse and zebrafish brain
datasets acquired using the wafer mapper ssEM imaging technology recently
developed at Harvard University. Unlike other methods now used for ssEM
registration, SWiFT-IR modifies its spatial frequency response during image
matching to maximize a signal-to-noise measure used as its primary indicator of
alignment quality. This alignment signal is more robust to rapid variations in
biological content and unavoidable data distortions than either phase-only or
standard Pearson correlation, thus allowing more precise alignment and
statistical confidence. These improvements in turn enable an iterative
registration procedure based on projections through multiple sections rather
than more typical adjacent-pair matching methods. This projection approach,
when coupled with known anatomical constraints and iteratively applied in a
multi-resolution pyramid fashion, drives the alignment into a smooth form that
properly represents complex and widely varying anatomical content such as the
full cross-section zebrafish data.

wide-field cameras (WFI@MPG/ESO and MOSAIC@CTIO/Blanco) in order to identify

OBe/OB stars to be 13% down to this limit, and by investigating this fraction

$\rho$ Ophiuchi A. The star has exhibited strong X-ray variability: a
cusp-shaped increase of rate, similar to that which we partially observed in
2013, and a bright flare. These events are separated in time by about 104 ks,
which likely corresponds to the rotational period of the star (1.2 days). Time
resolved spectroscopy of the X-ray spectra shows that the first event is caused
by an increase of the plasma emission measure, while the second increase of
rate is a major flare with temperatures in excess of 60 MK ($kT\sim5$ keV).
From the analysis of its rise, we infer a magnetic field of $\ge300$ G and a
size of the flaring region of $\sim1.4-1.9\times10^{11}$ cm, which corresponds
to $\sim25\%-30\%$ of the stellar radius. We speculate that either an intrinsic
magnetism that produces a hot spot on its surface or an unknown low mass
companion are the source of such X-rays and variability. A hot spot of magnetic
origin should be a stable structure over a time span of $\ge$2.5 years, and
suggests an overall large scale dipolar magnetic field that produces an
extended feature on the stellar surface. In the second scenario, a low mass
unknown companion is the emitter of X-rays and it should orbit extremely close
to the surface of the primary in a locked spin-orbit configuration, almost on
the verge of collapsing onto the primary. As such, the X-ray activity of the
secondary star would be enhanced by its young age, and the tight orbit as in RS
Cvn systems and $\rho$ Ophiuchi would constitute an extreme system that is
worthy of further investigation.

occurred at the nucleus of a known Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy hosting a
10$^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole. The transient was previously claimed to be a Type
IIn SLSN due to its luminosity and hydrogen emission lines. The light curve
shows that PS16dtm brightened by about two magnitudes in ~50 days relative to
the archival host brightness and then exhibited a plateau phase for about 100
days followed by the onset of fading in the UV. During the plateau PS16dtm
showed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of 1.7 x 10$^4$
K, and radiated at approximately $L_{Edd}$ of the SMBH. The spectra exhibit
multi-component hydrogen emission lines and strong FeII emission, show little
evolution with time, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being
distinct from those of Type IIn SNe. Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the
X-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of
its host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity
associated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with a SN origin or any
known form of AGN variability, and therefore we argue that it is a TDE in which
the accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and
excitation of the pre-existing broad line region, while providing material that
obscures the X-ray emitting region of the pre-existing AGN accretion disk. A
detailed TDE model fit to the light curve indicates that PS16dtm will remain
bright for several years; we further predict that the X-ray emission will
reappear on a similar timescale as the accretion rate declines. Finally, we
place PS16dtm in the context of other TDEs and find that TDEs in AGN galaxies
are an order of magnitude more efficient and reach Eddington luminosities,
likely due to interaction of the stellar debris with the pre-existing accretion
disk.

properties such as concentration and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as
assembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly bias on halo definition,
parametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\Delta$. We summarize the
strength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a
function of halo mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering
depends strongly on mass at all $\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions
($\Delta \sim 200\mathrm{m}-600\mathrm{m}$), concentration-dependent clustering
at low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through
interactions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can
be greatly reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\Delta \sim
20\mathrm{m}-40\mathrm{m}$ for haloes with $M_{200\mathrm{m}} \lesssim
10^{12}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Smaller $\Delta$ implies larger radii and
mitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called backsplash
haloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}
\gtrsim 10^{13}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) larger overdensities, $\Delta
\gtrsim 600\mathrm{m}$, are necessary. Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are
significant for all halo definitions that we explore and exhibit a relatively
weaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly
bias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common
definitions. We identify no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations
of assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates assembly bias based on one
halo property (e.g., concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo
definitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not
coincide with the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.

bosonic scalar field dark matter is a viable alternative to the standard cold

Broglie wavelength. We simulate BECDM halo formation through mergers, evolved
under the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations. The formed haloes consist of a
soliton core supported against gravitational collapse by the quantum pressure
tensor and an asymptotic $r^{-3}$ NFW-like profile. We find a fundamental
relation of the core=to-halo mass with the dimensionless invariant $\Xi \equiv
\lvert E \rvert/M^3/(Gm/\hbar)^2$ or $M_{\rm c}/M \simeq 2.6 \Xi^{1/3}$,
linking the soliton to global halo properties. For $r \geq 3.5 \,r_{\rm c}$
core radii, we find equipartition between potential, classical kinetic, and
quantum gradient energies. The haloes also exhibit a conspicuous turbulent
behavior driven by the continuous reconnection of vortex lines due to wave
interference. We analyse the turbulence 1D velocity power spectrum and find a
$k^{-1.1}$ power-law. This suggests the vorticity in BECDM haloes is
homogeneous, similar to thermally-driven counterflow BEC systems from condensed
matter physics, in contrast to a $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov power-law seen in
mechanically-driven quantum systems. The mode where the power spectrum peaks is
approximately the soliton width, implying the soliton-sized granules carry most
of the turbulent energy in BECDM haloes.

binary companions), and use information from Gaia to report distances and X-ray
luminosities for three of them. There are four CVs or CV candidates, and we
argue that NuSTAR J233426-2343.9 is a relatively strong CV candidate based
partly on an X-ray spectrum from XMM-Newton. NuSTAR J092418-3142.2, which is
the brightest serendipitous source in the Lansbury catalog, and NuSTAR
J073959-3147.8 are LMXB candidates, but it is also possible that these two
sources are CVs. One of the sources is a known HMXB, and NuSTAR J105008-5958.8
is a new HMXB candidate, which has strong Balmer emission lines in its optical
spectrum and a hard X-ray spectrum. We discuss the implications of finding
these HMXBs for the surface density (logN-logS) and luminosity function of
Galactic HMXBs. We conclude that, with the large fraction of unclassified

  transit feeds","  Retrieving and analyzing transit feeds relies on working with analytical
workflows that can handle the massive volume of data streams that are relevant
to understand the dynamics of transit networks which are entirely deterministic
in the geographical space in which they takes place. In this paper, we consider
the fundamental issues in developing a streaming analytical workflow for
analyzing the continuous arrival of multiple, unbounded transit data feeds for
automatically processing and enriching them with additional information
containing higher level concepts accordingly to a particular mobility context.
This workflow consists of three tasks: (1) stream data retrieval for creating
time windows; (2) data cleaning for handling missing data, overlap data or
redundant data; and (3) data contextualization for computing actual arrival and
departure times as well as the stops and moves during a bus trip, and also
performing mobility context computation. The workflow was implemented in a
Hadoop cloud ecosystem using data streams from the CODIAC Transit System of the
city of Moncton, NB. The Map() function of MapReduce is used to retrieve and
bundle data streams into numerous clusters which are subsequently handled in a
parallel manner by the Reduce() function in order to execute the data
contextualization step. The results validate the need for cloud computing for
achieving high performance and scalability, however, due to the delay in
computing and networking, it is clear that data cleaning tasks should not only
be deployed using a cloud environment, paving the way to combine it with fog
computing in the near future.

  magnetic fields","  We introduce the IllustrisTNG project, a new suite of cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO
employing an updated Illustris galaxy formation model. Here we focus on the
general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy
clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is
closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation
amplifies the initial seed fields ($10^{-14}$ comoving Gauss) to the values
observed in low-redshift galaxies ($1-10\,\mu{\rm G}$). The magnetic field
topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields
are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are
present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution
of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of $280$
clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of $1.1\times 10^{7}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$, and generate mock observations for VLA, LOFAR, ASKAP and SKA. Our
simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates
with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between
total radio power and X-ray emission, $M_{500}$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
$Y_{\rm 500}$ parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our
most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma
and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes
as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different
instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations,
but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic
particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.

  distribution in galaxy clusters from the IllustrisTNG simulations","  The distribution of metals in the intra-cluster medium encodes important
information about the enrichment history and formation of galaxy clusters. Here
we explore the metal content of clusters in IllustrisTNG - a new suite of
galaxy formation simulations building on the Illustris project. Our cluster
sample contains 20 objects in TNG100 - a ~(100 Mpc)^3 volume simulation with
2x1820^3 resolution elements, and 370 objects in TNG300 - a ~(300 Mpc)^3 volume
simulation with 2x2500^3 resolution elements. The z=0 metallicity profiles
agree with observations, and the enrichment history is consistent with
observational data going beyond z~1, showing nearly no metallicity evolution.
The abundance profiles vary only minimally within the cluster samples,
especially in the outskirts with a relative scatter of ~15%. The average
metallicity profile flattens towards the center, where we find a logarithmic
slope of -0.1 compared to -0.5 in the outskirts. Cool core clusters have more
centrally peaked metallicity profiles (~0.8 solar) compared to non-cool core
systems (~0.5 solar), similar to observational trends. Si/Fe and O/Fe radial
profiles follow positive gradients. The outer abundance profiles do not evolve
below z~2, whereas the inner profiles flatten towards z=0. More than ~80% of
the metals in the intra-cluster medium have been accreted from the
proto-cluster environment, which has been enriched to ~0.1 solar already at
z~2. We conclude that the intra-cluster metal distribution is uniform among our
cluster sample, nearly time-invariant in the outskirts for more than 10 Gyr,
and forms through a universal enrichment history.

algorithms, focusing on their potential power to test a particular class of
modified gravity models - chameleon $f(R)$ gravity. These models deviate from
standard General Relativity (GR) more strongly in low-density regions and thus
voids are a promising venue to test them. We use Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) prescriptions to populate haloes with galaxies, and tune the HOD
parameters such that the galaxy two-point correlation functions are the same in
both f(R) and GR models. We identify both 3D voids as well as 2D underdensities
in the plane-of-the-sky to find the same void abundance and void galaxy number
density profiles across all models, which suggests that they do not contain
much information beyond galaxy clustering. However, the underlying void dark
matter density profiles are significantly different, with f(R) voids being more
underdense than GR ones, which leads to f(R) voids having a larger tangential
shear signal than their GR analogues. We investigate the potential of each void
finder to test f(R) models with near-future lensing surveys such as EUCLID and
LSST. The 2D voids have the largest power to probe f(R) gravity, with a LSST

relating observational multi-wavelength time series data to models derived from
our understanding of physical laws. This goal is typically accomplished by
dividing the task in two: collecting data (observing), and constructing models
to represent that data (theorizing). Owing to the natural tendency for
specialization, a disconnect can develop between the best available theories
and the best available data, potentially delaying advances in our understanding
new classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open-Source Fitter
for Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient datasets from
open online catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo
ensembles of semi-analytical light curve fits to those datasets and their
associated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally delivers the fitting
results back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the
community. MOSFiT is designed to help bridge the gap between observations and
theory in time-domain astronomy; in addition to making the application of
existing models and creation of new models as simple as possible, MOSFiT yields
statistically robust predictions for transient characteristics, with a standard
output format that includes all the setup information necessary to reproduce a
given result. As large-scale surveys such as LSST discover entirely new classes
of transients, tools such as MOSFiT will be critical for enabling rapid
comparison of models against data in statistically consistent, reproducible,

archival photometry and new optical/near-IR imaging and spectroscopy, together
with stellar population synthesis models to infer the global properties of the
host galaxy. We infer a star formation history peaked at $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago,
with subsequent exponential decline leading to a low current star formation
rate of 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which we convert into a binary merger
timescale probability distribution. We find a median merger timescale of
$11.2^{+0.7}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, with a 90% confidence range of $6.8-13.6$ Gyr. This
in turn indicates an initial binary separation of $\approx 4.5$ R$_{\odot}$,

http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08420v2,A census of cool core galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG,"  The thermodynamic structure of hot gas in galaxy clusters is sensitive to
astrophysical processes and typically difficult to model with galaxy formation
simulations. We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large
sample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC
definitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the
extremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the
criteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the
CC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed
fractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result
is partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed
gas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative
agreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the
simulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs
appears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the
fraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are
more relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting
CCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC
criteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is
dependent on the CC criteria. We conclude that the thermodynamic structure of
galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG shares many similarities with observations, but
achieving better agreement most likely requires modifications of the underlying
galaxy formation model.

  galaxies","  The (re)ionisation of hydrogen in the early universe has a profound effect on
the formation of the first galaxies: by raising the gas temperature and
pressure, it prevents gas from cooling into small haloes thus affecting the
abundance of present-day small galaxies. Using the Galform semi-analytic model
of galaxy formation, we show that two key aspects of the reionisation process
-- when reionisation takes place and the characteristic scale below which it
suppresses galaxy formation -- are imprinted in the luminosity function of
dwarf galaxies. We focus on the luminosity function of satellites of galaxies
like the Milky Way and the LMC, which is easier to measure than the luminosity
function of the dwarf population as a whole. Our results show that the details
of these two characteristic properties of reionisation determine the shape of
the luminosity distribution of satellites in a unique way, and is largely
independent of the other details of the galaxy formation model. Our models
generically predict a bimodality in the distribution of satellites as a
function of luminosity: a population of faint satellites and population of
bright satellites separated by a 'valley' forged by reionisation. We show that
this bimodal distribution is present at high statistical significance in the
combined satellite luminosity function of the Milky Way and M31. We make
predictions for the expected number of satellites around LMC-mass dwarfs where
the bimodality may also be measurable in future observational programmes. Our
preferred model predicts a total of $26 \pm 10$ (68 per cent confidence)
satellites brighter than ${\rm M}_V=0$ in LMC-mass systems.

obtained in [5, 6] for the anisotropic Calder{\'o}n problem at fixed frequency,
in dimension n $\ge$ 3, when the Dirichlet and Neumann data are measured on
disjoint subsets of the boundary. These non-uniqueness results are of the

boundary (M, g) of dimension n $\ge$ 3, we first show that there exist in the
conformal class of g an infinite number of Riemannian metrics gmetrics metrics
g such that their corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps at a fixed frequency

The corresponding conformal factors satisfy a nonlinear elliptic PDE of Yamabe
type on (M, g) and arise from a natural but subtle gauge invariance of the
Calder{\'o}n when the data are given on disjoint sets. We then present
counterexamples to uniqueness in dimension n $\ge$ 3 to the anisotropic
Calder{\'o}n problem at fixed frequency with data on disjoint sets, which do
not arise from this gauge invariance. They are given by cylindrical Riemannian
manifolds with boundary having two ends, equipped with a suitably chosen warped

galaxies. We use the CloudyFSPS nebular emission model of Byler et al. 2017,
extended to include emission predictions in the UV, to evaluate the metallicity
sensitivity of established UV stellar absorption indices, and to identify those
that include a significant contribution from nebular emission. We present model

can improve the quality of parametric maps over a post-reconstruction fitting,
and showed how the novel sparsity prior can further reduce their variance,
without affecting bias. Real FDG PET human brain data (Siemens mMR, 40min)

enough to be unbound from the Milky Way. Several mechanisms have been proposed
for producing them, including the interaction of the Galaxy's super-massive
black hole (SMBH) with a binary; rapid mass-loss from a companion to a star in
a short-period binary; the tidal disruption of an infalling galaxy and finally
ejection from the Large Magellanic Cloud. While previously discovered
high-velocity early-type stars are thought to be the result of an interaction
with the SMBH, the origin of high-velocity late type stars is ambiguous. The
second data release of Gaia (DR2) enables a unique opportunity to resolve this
ambiguity and determine whether any late-type candidates are truly unbound from
the Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize the new proper motion and velocity
information available from DR2 to re-evaluate a collection of historical data
compiled on the newly-created Open Fast Stars Catalog. We find that almost all
previously-known high-velocity late-type stars are most likely bound to the
Milky Way. Only one late-type object (LAMOST J115209.12+120258.0) is unbound
from the Galaxy. Performing integrations of orbital histories, we find that
this object cannot have been ejected from the Galactic centre and thus may be
either debris from the disruption of a satellite galaxy or a disc runaway.

However, most models of structure formation neglect potentially important

we explore the impact of ATC on the prevalence of cool-cores (CCs) using 12
pairs of magnetohydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations, simulated using the
IllustrisTNG model with and without ATC. Although the impact of ATC varies from
cluster to cluster and with CC criterion, its inclusion produces a systematic
shift to larger CC fractions at z = 0 for all CC criteria considered.
Additionally, the inclusion of ATC yields a flatter CC fraction redshift
evolution, easing the tension with the observed evolution. With ATC included,
the energy required for the central black hole to achieve self-regulation is
reduced and the gas fraction in the cluster core increases, resulting in larger
CC fractions. ATC makes the ICM unstable to perturbations and the increased
efficiency of AGN feedback suggests that its inclusion results in a greater
level of mixing in the ICM. Therefore, ATC is potentially an important physical
process in reproducing the thermal structure of the ICM.

I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) classified as part of our search for low-$z$
SLSNe. PS16aqv is a fast evolving SLSNe-I that reached a peak absolute
magnitude of $M_{r} \approx -22.1$. The lightcurves exhibit a significant
undulation at 30 rest-frame days after peak, with a behavior similar to
undulations seen in the slowly fading SLSN-I SN 2015bn. This similarity
strengthens the case that fast and slow SLSNe-I form a continuum with a common
origin. At $\approx\!80$ days after peak, the lightcurves exhibit a transition
to a slow decline, followed by significant subsequent steepening, indicative of
a plateau phase or a second significant undulation. Deep limits at $\approx280$
days after peak imply a tight constraint on the nickel mass, $M_{\rm Ni}
\lesssim 0.35$ M$_{\odot}$ (lower than for previous SLSNe-I), and indicate that
some SLSNe-I do not produce significantly more nickel than normal Type Ic SNe.
Using MOSFiT, we model the lightcurve with a magnetar central engine model and
find $P_{\rm spin} \approx 0.9$ ms, $B \approx 1.5 \times 10^{14}$ G, and
$M_{\rm ej} \approx 16$ M$_{\odot}$. The implied rapid spin-down time and large
reservoir of available energy coupled with the high ejecta mass may account for
the fast evolving lightcurve and slow spectroscopic evolution. We also study
the location of PS16aqv in its host galaxy and find that it occurred at an
offset of $2.46 \pm 0.21$ kpc from the central star-forming region. We find the
host galaxy exhibits low metallicity and spatially varying extinction and star
formation rate, with the explosion site exhibiting lower values than the
central region. The complexity seen in the lightcurves of PS16aqv and other
events highlights the importance of obtaining well-sampled lightcurves for
exploring deviations from a uniform decline.

method. The detection system consists of eight LaBr3 scintillators and a
tungsten collimator, mounted on a rotating frame. Custom electronics and
calibration algorithms have been developed for the measurement of energy- and
time-resolved gamma-ray spectra during proton irradiation at a clinical dose
rate. Using experimentally determined nuclear reaction cross sections and a
GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation, a detailed model of the expected
gamma-ray emissions is created for each individual pencil-beam. The absolute
range of the proton pencil-beams is determined by minimizing the discrepancy
between the measurement and this model, leaving the absolute range of the beam
and the elemental concentrations of the irradiated matter as free parameters.
The system was characterized in a clinical-like situation by irradiating
different phantoms with a scanning pencil-beam. A dose of 0.9 Gy was delivered
to a 5x10x10 cm^3 target with a beam current of 2 nA incident on the phantom.
Different range shifters and materials were used to test the robustness of the
verification method and to calculate the accuracy of the detected range. The
absolute proton range was determined for each spot of the distal energy layer
with a mean statistical precision of 1.1 mm at a 95% confidence level and a
mean systematic deviation of 0.5 mm, when aggregating pencil-beam spots within
a cylindrical region of 10 mm radius and 10 mm depth. Small range errors that
we introduced were successfully detected and even large differences in the
elemental composition do not affect the range verification accuracy. These
results show that our system is suitable for range verification during patient
treatments in our upcoming clinical study.

  Multi-Epoch Spectroscopy. III. Candidates from Continued Radial Velocity
  Tests","  Quasars whose broad emission lines show temporal, bulk radial velocity (RV)
shifts have been proposed as candidate sub-parsec (sub-pc), binary supermassive
black holes (BSBHs). We identified a sample of 16 BSBH candidates based on
two-epoch spectroscopy among 52 quasars with significant RV shifts over a few
rest-frame years. The candidates showed consistent velocity shifts
independently measured from two broad lines (H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ or Mg${\rm
\,II}$) without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Here in the
third paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch
spectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning
$\sim$5--15 yr in the quasars' rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the
broad H$\beta$ calibrated against [O${\rm\,III}]\,\lambda 5007$ suggests that 5
of the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H$\beta$ RV
curves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant
changes in the broad line profiles. Their broad H$\alpha$ (or Mg${\rm \,II}$)
lines display RV shifts that are either consistent with or smaller than those
seen in broad H$\beta$. The RV shifts can be explained by a $\sim$0.05--0.1 pc
BSBH with an orbital period of $\sim$40--130 yr, assuming a mass ratio of
0.5--2 and a circular orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained
given the few epochs that sample only a small portion of the hypothesized
binary orbital cycle. The apparent occurrence rate of sub-pc BSBHs is
$\lesssim$13$\pm$5% among all SDSS quasars, with no significant difference in
the subsets with and without single-epoch broad line velocity offsets.
Dedicated long-term spectroscopic monitoring is still needed to further confirm
or reject these BSBH candidates.

  Forming Brown Dwarfs Unveiled?","  On the basis of various data such as ALMA, JVLA, Chandra, {\it Herschel}, and
{\it Spitzer}, we confirmed that two protostellar candidates in Oph-A are bona
fide protostars or proto-brown dwarfs (proto-BDs) in extremely early
evolutionary stages. Both objects are barely visible across infrared (IR, i.e.,
near-IR to far-IR) bands. The physical nature of the cores is very similar to
that expected in first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs), objects theoretically
predicted in the evolutionary phase prior to stellar core formation with gas
densities of $\sim$ 10$^{11-12}$ cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that the evolutionary
stage is close to the FHSC formation phase. The two objects are associated with
faint X-ray sources, suggesting that they are in very early phase of stellar
core formation with magnetic activity. In addition, we found the CO outflow
components around both sources which may originate from the young outflows
driven by these sources. The masses of these objects are calculated to be $\sim
0.01-0.03$ $M_\odot$ from the dust continuum emission. Their physical
properties are consistent with that expected from the numerical model of
forming brown dwarfs. These facts (the X-ray detection, CO outflow association,
and FHSC-like spectral energy distributions) strongly indicate that the two
objects are proto-BDs or will be in the very early phase of protostars which
will evolve more massive protostars if they gain enough mass from the
surroundings. The ages of these two objects are likely to be within $\sim 10^3$
years after the protostellar core (or second core) formation, taking into
account the outflow dynamical times ($\lesssim$ 500 yrs).

braneworld models, which are representative of a class of modified gravity
theories where deviations from General Relativity are usually hidden by the
Vainshtein screening in high-density environments. This screening is less
efficient away from these environments, which makes voids ideally suited for
testing this class of models. We use N-body simulations of $\Lambda$-cold dark
matter ($\Lambda$CDM) and nGDP universes, where dark matter haloes are
populated with mock galaxies that mimic the clustering and number densities of
the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample. We measure the force, density and weak lensing
profiles around voids identified with six different algorithms. Compared to
$\Lambda$CDM, voids in nDGP are more under-dense due to the action of the fifth
force that arises in these models, which leads to a faster evacuation of matter
from voids. This leaves an imprint on the weak lensing tangential shear profile
around nDGP voids, an effect that is particularly strong for 2D underdensities
that are identified in the plane-of-the-sky. We make predictions for the
feasibility of distinguishing between nDGP and $\Lambda$CDM using void lensing
in upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST and Euclid. We compare with the
analysis of voids in chameleon gravity theories and find that the weak lensing
signal for 3D voids is similar to nDGP, whereas for 2D voids the differences
with $\Lambda$CDM are much stronger for the chameleon gravity case, a direct
consequence of the different screening mechanisms operating in these theories.

a series of complex eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the transit of a giant
Hill sphere filling debris ring system around a secondary companion, J1407b. No
other eclipses have since been detected, although other measurements have
constrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding
another eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the
system, the geometry of the proposed ring system and enable planning of further
observations to characterize the material within these putative rings. Aims. We
carry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of J1407 with the aim
of constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods. We present photometry
from archival photographic plates from the Harvard DASCH survey, and Bamberg
and Sonneberg Observatories, in order to place additional constraints on the
orbital period of J1407b by searching for other dimming and eclipse events.
Using a visual inspection of all 387 plates and a period-folding algorithm we
performed a search for other eclipses in these data sets. Results. We find no
other deep eclipses in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent
time-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions. We rule out a large
fraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 years. These
limits are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere filling ring
system surrounding a brown dwarf companion in a bound elliptical orbit about
J1407. Issues with the stability of any rings combined with the lack of
detection of another eclipse, suggests that J1407b may not be bound to J1407.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10824v1,Lyman Continuum Observations of Solar Flares Using SDO/EVE,"  The Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment was designed to observe the
Sun-as-a-star in the extreme ultraviolet; a wavelength range that has remained
spectrally unresolved for many years. It has provided a wealth of data on solar
flares, perhaps most uniquely, on the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen at high
cadence and moderate spectral resolution. In this paper we concentrate on the
analysis of Lyman continuum (LyC) observations and its temporal evolution in a
sample of six major solar flares. By fitting both the pre-flare and flare
excess spectra with a blackbody function we show that the color temperature
derived from the slope of LyC reveals temperatures in excess of 10$^{4}$ K in
the six events studied; an increase of a few thousand Kelvin above quiet-Sun
values (typically $\sim$8000-9500 K). This was found to be as high as 17000 K
for the 2017 September 6 X9.3 flare. Using these temperature values, and
assuming a flaring area of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{2}$, estimates of the departure
coefficient of hydrogen, $b_1$, were calculated. It was found that $b_1$
decreased from 10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ in the quiet-Sun, to around unity during the
flares. This implies that LyC is optically thick and formed in local
thermodynamic equilibrium during flares. It also emanates from a relatively
thin ($\lesssim$100 km) shell formed at deeper, denser layers than in the
quiescent solar atmosphere. We show that in terms of temporal coverage and
resolution, EVE gives a more comprehensive picture of the response of the
chromosphere to the flare energy input with respect to those of the
Skylab/Harvard College Observatory spatially resolved observations of the
1970's.

(SLSN-I) SN2017dwh at $z\!\approx\!0.13$, which reached $M_{i}\!\approx\!-21$
mag at peak. Spectra taken a few days after peak show an unusual and strong
absorption line centered near 3200\AA\ that we identify with Co II, suggesting
a high fraction of synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the ejecta. By $\sim\!1$ month
after peak, SN2017dwh became much redder than other SLSNe-I, instead strongly
resembling broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (Ic-BL SNe) with clear suppression of
the flux redward of $\sim\!5000$ \AA, providing further evidence for a large
mass of Fe-group elements. Late-time upper limits indicate a $^{56}$Ni mass of
$\lesssim 0.6$ M$_\odot$, leaving open the possibility that SN2017dwh produced
a $^{56}$Ni mass comparable to SN1998bw ($\approx\!0.4$ M$_\odot$). Fitting the
light curve with a combined magnetar and $^{56}$Ni model using ${\tt MOSFiT}$,
we find that the light curve can easily accommodate such masses without
affecting the inferred magnetar parameters. We also find that SN2017dwh
occurred in the least-luminous detected host galaxy to date for a SLSN-I, with
$M_{B} = -13.5$ mag and an implied metallicity of $Z\!\sim\!0.08$ $Z_\odot$.
The spectral properties of SN2017dwh provide new evidence linking SLSNe-I with
Type Ic-BL SNe, and in particular the high Fe-group abundance may be due to
enhanced $^{56}$Ni production or mixing due to asphericity. Finally, we find
that SN2017dwh represents the most extreme end of a correlation between
continuum shape and Co II absorption strength in the near-peak spectra of
SLSNe-I, indicating that Fe-group abundance likely accounts for some of the
variation in their spectral shapes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00731v2,The age of secrecy and unfairness in recidivism prediction,"  In our current society, secret algorithms make important decisions about
individuals. There has been substantial discussion about whether these
algorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is
complex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of
fairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the
focus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to
meet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a
result, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading
descriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can
easily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a
recidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system
-- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age,
despite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by
subtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show
that COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's
analysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions
about a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked
without careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the
first place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in
this work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score
but long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur
frequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies
a different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and
the public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations
behind risk scores for recidivism.

  and the Distribution of Stellar Mass in Massive Galaxies","  Using deep images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and taking
advantage of its unprecedented weak lensing capabilities, we reveal a
remarkably tight connection between the stellar mass distribution of massive
central galaxies and their host dark matter halo mass. Massive galaxies with
more extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark
matter haloes. We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that
assumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar
content in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in-situ and ex-situ mass at
$r<10$ kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description
of the stellar mass functions (SMF) of total stellar mass ($M_{\star}^{\rm
Max}$) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc ($M_{\star}^{10}$) and also
reproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different
stellar mass distributions. The best-fit model shows that halo mass varies
significantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear
dependence on $M_{\star}^{10}$. Our two-parameter $M_{\star}^{\rm
Max}$-$M_{\star}^{10}$ description provides a more accurate picture of the
galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass
relation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of halos
with those of central galaxies. The model also predicts that the ex-situ
component dominates the mass profiles of galaxies at $r< 10$ kpc for $\log
M_{\star} \ge 11.7$). The code used for this paper is available online:

evolution. Here we present cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a cluster
of galaxies, $M_\text{200,crit}=6 \times 10^{14}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, including a
novel dust model for the moving mesh code {\sc Arepo}. This model includes dust
production, growth, supernova-shock-driven destruction, ion-collision-driven
thermal sputtering, and high temperature dust cooling through far infrared
re-radiation of collisionally deposited electron energies. Adopting a rather
low thermal sputtering rate, we find, consistent with observations, a
present-day overall dust-to-gas ratio of $\sim 2\times 10^{-5}$, a total dust
mass of $\sim 2\times 10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$, and a dust mass fraction of $\sim
3\times 10^{-6}$. The typical thermal sputtering timescales within $\sim

parts of the cluster to $\sim 10^3\,{\rm Myr}$ at a cluster-centric distance of
$1\,{\rm Mpc}$. The condensation of gas phase metals into dust grains reduces
high temperature metal-line cooling, but also leads to additional dust infrared
cooling. The additional infrared cooling changes the overall cooling rate in
the outer parts of the cluster, beyond $\sim 1\,{\rm Mpc}$, by factors of a
few. This results in noticeable changes of the entropy, temperature, and
density profiles of cluster gas once dust formation is included. The emitted
dust infrared emission due to dust cooling is consistent with observational
constraints.

  field","  Identifying the source population of ionizing radiation, responsible for the
reionization of the universe, is currently a hotly debated subject with
conflicting results. Studies of faint, high-redshift star-forming galaxies, in
most cases, fail to detect enough escaping ionizing radiation to sustain the
process. Recently, the capacity of bright quasi-stellar objects to ionize their
surrounding medium has been confirmed also for faint active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), which were found to display an escaping fraction of ~74% at z~4. Such
levels of escaping radiation could sustain the required UV background, given
the number density of faint AGNs is adequate. Thus, it is mandatory to
accurately measure the luminosity function of faint AGNs (L~L*) in the same
redshift range. For this reason we have conducted a spectroscopic survey, using
the wide field spectrograph IMACS at the 6.5m Baade Telescope, to determine the
nature of our sample of faint AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This sample
was assembled using photometric redshifts, color, and X-ray information. We
ended up with 16 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs at 3.6<z<4.2 down to a
magnitude of i$_{AB}$=23.0 for an area of 1.73 deg$^{2}$. This leads to an AGN
space density of ~1.6$\times10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}$ (corrected) at z~4 for an
absolute magnitude of M$_{1450}$=-23.5. This is higher than previous
measurements and seems to indicate that AGNs could make a substantial
contribution to the ionizing background at z~4. Assuming that AGN physical
parameters remain unchanged at higher redshifts and fainter luminosities, these
sources could be regarded as the main drivers of cosmic reionization.

  robustness in yeast cell-cycle process","  The biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as
cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and keep the dynamic
robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the dynamic mechanism
and the fundamental structure to achieve these properties in the cell-cycle
process of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the budding
yeast cell-cycle process behaves like an excitable system containing three
well-coupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis
events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be separated into G1/S
phase module, early M module and late M phase module, where the positive
feedbacks in each module and the interactions among the modules play important
role. If the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the
saddle-node bifurcations, there is a critical slowing down or ghost effect.
This can provide the cell-cycle process with a sufficient duration for each
event and an attractive manifold for the state checking of the completion of
DNA replication and mitosis; moreover, the fluctuation in the early
module/event is forbidden to transmit to the latter module/event. Our results
suggest both a fundamental structure of cell-cycle regulatory network and a

  clusters","  Feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is essential for regulating the
fast radiative cooling of low-entropy gas at the centers of galaxy clusters and
for reducing star formation rates of central ellipticals. The details of
self-regulation depend critically on the unknown contents of AGN-inflated
bubbles. Observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal of AGN bubbles
provide us with the ability to directly measure the lobe electron pressure
given a bubble morphology. Here we compute the SZ signal of jet-inflated
bubbles in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy
cluster MS0735.6+7421 with the Arepo code, and compare our synthetic SZ results
to inferences obtained with popular modelling approaches. We find that cutting
out ellipsoidal bubbles from a double-beta pressure profile only matches the
inner bubble edges in the simulations and fails to account for the emission of
the shock-enhanced pressure cocoon outside the bubbles. This additional
contribution significantly worsens the accuracy of the cut-out method for jets
with small inclinations with respect to the line of sight. Also, the kinetic SZ
effect of the bubbles, a previously neglected contribution, becomes relevant at
these smaller inclinations due to entrainment and mixing of the intracluster
medium with low-density jet material. Fortunately, the different signs of the
kinetic SZ signal in opposite lobes allow modelling this effect. We present an
approximate method to determine the jet inclination, which combines jet power
and lifetime estimates, the stand-off distance between jet head and bow shock,
and the kinetic SZ effect, thereby helping to correctly infer the bubble
contents.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02016v2,The local high velocity tail and the Galactic escape speed,"  We model the fastest moving (v_tot > 300 km/s) local (D < 3 kpc) halo stars
using cosmological simulations and 6-dimensional Gaia data. Our approach is to
use our knowledge of the assembly history and phase-space distribution of halo
stars to constrain the form of the high velocity tail of the stellar halo.
Using simple analytical models and cosmological simulations, we find that the
shape of the high velocity tail is strongly dependent on the velocity
anisotropy and number density profile of the halo stars --- highly eccentric
orbits and/or shallow density profiles have more extended high velocity tails.
The halo stars in the solar vicinity are known to have a strongly radial
velocity anisotropy, and it has recently been shown the origin of these highly
eccentric orbits is the early accretion of a massive (M_star ~ 10^9 M_Sun)
dwarf satellite. We use this knowledge to construct a prior on the shape of the
high velocity tail. Moreover, we use the simulations to define an appropriate
outer boundary of 2r_200, beyond which stars can escape. After applying our
methodology to the Gaia data, we find a local (r_0=8.3 kpc) escape speed of
v_esc(r_0) = 528(+24,-25) km/s. We use our measurement of the escape velocity
to estimate the total Milky Way mass, and dark halo concentration: M_200,tot =
1.00(+0.31,-0.24) x 10^12 M_Sun, c_200 = 10.9(+4.4,-3.3). Our estimated mass
agrees with recent results in the literature that seem to be converging on a
Milky Way mass of M_200,tot ~ 10^12 M_Sun.

  Reconnection","  The plasma in low-luminosity accretion flows, such as the one around the
black hole at the center of M87 or Sgr A* at our Galactic Center, is expected
to be collisioness and two-temperature, with protons hotter than electrons.
Here, particle heating is expected to be controlled by magnetic reconnection in
the transrelativistic regime $\sigma_{w}\sim 0.1$-$1$, where the magnetization
$\sigma_{w}$ is the ratio of magnetic energy density to plasma enthalpy
density. By means of large-scale 2D particle-in-cell simulations, we explore
for a fiducial $\sigma_w=0.1$ how the dissipated magnetic energy gets
partitioned between electrons and protons, as a function of $\beta_{\rm i}$
(the ratio of proton thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) and of the strength
of a guide field $B_{\rm g}$ perpendicular to the reversing field $B_0$. At low
$\beta_{\rm i}\;(\lesssim 0.1)$, we find that the fraction of initial magnetic
energy per particle converted into electron irreversible heat is nearly
independent of $B_{\rm g}/B_0$, whereas protons get heated much less with
increasing $B_{\rm g}/B_0$. As a result, for large $B_{\rm g} /B_{0}$,
electrons receive the overwhelming majority of irreversible particle heating
(${\sim}93\%$ for $B_{\rm g} /B_{0}=6$). This is significantly different than
the antiparallel case $B_{\rm g}/B_0=0$, in which electron irreversible heating
accounts for only ${\sim}18\%$ of the total particle heating. At $\beta_{\rm i}
\sim 2$, when both species start already relativistically hot (for our fiducial
$\sigma_w=0.1$), electrons and protons each receive ${\sim}50\%$ of the
irreversible particle heating, regardless of the guide field strength. Our
results provide important insights into the plasma physics of electron and
proton heating in hot accretion flows around supermassive black holes.

angular correlation functions to constrain the stellar-to-halo mass ratios
(SHMRs) of passive and \np\ galaxies at $z\sim2-3$, as identified in the
\emph{Spitzer} Matching Survey of the UltraVISTA ultra-deep Stripes (SMUVS). We
adopt a sophisticated halo modeling approach to statistically divide our two
populations into central and satellite galaxies. For central galaxies, we find
that the normalization of the SHMR is greater for our passive population.
Through the modeling of $\Lambda$ cold dark matter halo mass accretion
histories, we show that this can only arise if the conversion of baryons into
stars was more efficient at higher redshifts and additionally that passive
galaxies can be plausibly explained as residing in halos with the highest
formation redshifts (i.e., those with the lowest accretion rates) at a given
halo mass. At a fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies occupy host halos with a
greater mass than central galaxies, and we find further that the fraction of
passive galaxies that are satellites is higher than for the combined
population. This, and our derived satellite quenching timescales, combined with
earlier estimates from the literature, support dynamical/environmental
mechanisms as the dominant process for satellite quenching at $z\lesssim3$.

to the orthogonality of the basic functions, and thus the simplified methods

them to 2000+ variable stars of different types. The data were obtained from an
international collaboration in a frame of the ""Inter-Longitude Astronomy"" (ILA)

of our original publications. The main improvements were done: 1) for the
periodogram analysis - the parameters are determined from a complete set of
equations containing the (algebraic polynomial) trend superimposed on the
(multi-) harmonic wave, so no ""detrending"", no ""prewhitening"" are used; 2) for
the approximations - we use additional (multi-) harmonic waves, and also
""special shapes"" (patterns) for parts of the light curve, which correspond to
relatively fast changes (minima of the eclipsing binaries, minima and maxima
for the pulsating variables); 3) ""auto correlation analysis"" (ACF) - taking
into account the bias due to a trend removal (previously - only a subtraction
of the sample mean was taken into account); ACF for the irregularly spaced
data; 4) for the signals with bad coherence, the ""scalegram"" analysis is
proposed, which allows to estimate a characteristic cycle length and the

  Tidal Disruption Flares","  The question of how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow over cosmic time is
a major puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. One promising approach to this
problem is via the study of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). These are transient
events resulting from the disruption of stars by quiescent supermassive black
holes at centers of galaxies. A meter-class X-ray observatory with a time
resolution $\sim$ a millisecond and a spectral resolution of a few eV at KeV
energies would be revolutionary as it will facilitate high signal to noise
spectral-timing studies of several cosmological TDFs. It would open a new era
of astrophysics where SMBHs in TDFs at cosmic distances can be studied in
similar detail as current studies of much nearer, stellar-mass black hole
binaries. Using Athena X-ray observatory as an example, we highlight two
specific aspects of spectral-timing analysis of TDFs. (1) Detection of X-ray
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) over a redshift range and using these signal
frequencies to constrain the spin evolution of SMBHs, and (2) Time-resolved
spectroscopy of outflows/winds to probe super-Eddington accretion. SMBH spin
distributions at various redshifts will directly allow us to constrain their
primary mode of growth as higher spins are predicted due to spin-up for
prolonged accretion-mode growth, while lower spins are expected for growth via
mergers due to angular momentum being deposited from random directions. A
meter-class X-ray telescope will also be able to characterize relativistic
TDFs, viz., SwJ1644+57-like events, out to a redshift greater than 8, i.e., it
would facilitate detailed spectral-timing studies of TDFs by the youngest SMBHs

  Epoch with Lyman-alpha","  The epoch of reionization (6 < z < 10) marks the period in our universe when
the first large galaxies grew to fruition, and began to affect the universe
around them. Massive stars, and potentially accreting supermassive black holes,
filled the universe with ionizing radiation, burning off the haze of neutral
gas that had filled the intergalactic medium (IGM) since recombination
(z~1000). The evolution of this process constrains key properties of these
earliest luminous sources, thus observationally constraining reionization is a
key science goal for the next decade. The measurement of Lyman-alpha emission
from photometrically-identified galaxies is a highly constraining probe of
reionization, as a neutral IGM will resonantly scatter these photons, reducing
detectability. While significant work has been done with 8-10m telescopes,
these observations require extremely large telescopes (ELTs); the flux limits
available from today's 10m class telescopes are sufficient for only the
brightest known galaxies (m < 26). Ultra-deep surveys with the Giant Magellan
Telescope (GMT) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will be capable of detecting
Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies 2-3 magnitudes fainter than today's deepest
surveys. Wide-field fiber spectroscopy on the GMT combined with narrow-field
AO-assisted slit spectroscopy on the TMT will be able to probe the expected
size of ionized bubbles throughout the epoch of reionization, following up
degree scale deep imaging surveys with the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope.
These data will provide the first resolved Lyman-alpha-based maps of the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04742v1,Testing the Nature of Dark Matter with Extremely Large Telescopes,"  For nearly 40 years, dark matter has been widely assumed to be cold and
collisionless. Cold dark matter models make fundamental predictions for the
behavior of dark matter on small (<10 kpc) scales. These predictions include
cuspy density profiles at the centers of dark matter halos and a halo mass
function that increases as dN/dM ~ M^-1.9 down to very small masses. We suggest
two observational programs relying on extremely large telescopes to critically
test these predictions, and thus shed new light on the nature of dark matter.
(1) Combining adaptive optics-enabled imaging with deep spectroscopy to measure
the three-dimensional motions of stars within a sample of Local Group dwarf
galaxies that are the cleanest dark matter laboratories known in the nearby
universe. From these observations the inner slope of the dark matter density
profile can be determined with an accuracy of 0.20 dex, enabling a central cusp
to be distinguished from a core at 5 sigma significance. (2)
Diffraction-limited AO imaging and integral field spectroscopy of
gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars to quantify the abundance of dark
substructures in the halos of the lens galaxies and along the line of sight.
Observations of 50 lensed arcs and 50 multiply-imaged quasars will be
sufficient to measure the halo mass function over the range 10^7 < M < 10^10
Msun at cosmological scales, independent of the baryonic and stellar
composition of those structures. These two observational probes provide
complementary information about the small scale structure, with a joint
self-consistent analysis mitigating limitations of either probe. This program
will produce the strongest existing constraints on the properties of dark
matter on small scales, allowing conclusive tests of alternative warm, fuzzy,
and self-interacting dark matter models.

(IGM) onto galaxies at z~3 requires the detection of faint (L<<L*) galaxies
embedded in a filamentary matrix of low-density, metal-poor gas coherent over
hundreds of kpc. We study the gaseous environment of three Lyman$\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) at z=2.7-2.8, found to be aligned in projection with a
background QSO over ~250 kpc along the slit of a long-slit spectrum. The lack
of detection of the LAEs in deep continuum images and the low inferred
Ly$\alpha$ luminosities show the LAEs to be intrinsically faint, low-mass
galaxies (L<0.1 L*, M_star< 0.1 M*). An echelle spectrum of the QSO reveals
strong Ly-alpha absorption within $\pm200$ km/s from the LAEs. Our absorption
line analysis leads to HI column densities in the range of log N(HI) =16-18.
Associated absorption from ionic metal species CIV and SiIV constrains the gas
metallicities to ~0.01 solar if the gas is optically thin, and possibly as low
as ~0.001 solar if the gas is optically thick, assuming photoionization
equilibrium. While the inferred metallicities are at least a factor of ten
lower than expected metallicities in the interstellar medium (ISM) of these
LAEs, they are consistent with the observed chemical enrichment level in the
IGM at the same epoch. Total metal abundances and kinematic arguments suggest
that these faint galaxies have not been able to affect the properties of their
surrounding gas. The projected spatial alignment of the LAEs, together with the
kinematic quiescence and correspondence between the LAEs and absorbing gas in
velocity space suggests that these observations probe a possible filamentary
structure. Taken together with the blue-dominant Ly$\alpha$ emission line
profile of one of the objects, the evidence suggests that the absorbing gas is
part of an accretion stream of low-metallicity gas in the IGM.

have the potential to measure stellar populations and star formation histories
in semi-resolved galaxies. Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with

  check, and additional evidence","  Overshooting from the convective cores of stars more massive than about 1.2
M(Sun) has a profound impact on their subsequent evolution. And yet, the
formulation of the overshooting mechanism in current stellar evolution models
has a free parameter (f[ov] in the diffusive approximation) that remains poorly
constrained by observations, affecting the determination of astrophysically
important quantities such as stellar ages. In an earlier series of papers we
assembled a sample of 37 well-measured detached eclipsing binaries to calibrate
the dependence of f[ov] on stellar mass, showing that it increases sharply up
to a mass of roughly 2 M(Sun), and remains constant thereafter out to at least
4.4 M(Sun). Recent claims have challenged the utility of eclipsing binaries for
this purpose, on the basis that the uncertainties in f[ov] from the model fits
are typically too large to be useful, casting doubt on a dependence of
overshooting on mass. Here we reexamine those claims and show them to be too
pessimistic, mainly because they did not account for all available constraints
--- both observational and theoretical --- in assessing the true uncertainties.
We also take the opportunity to add semi-empirical f[ov] determinations for 13
additional binaries to our previous sample, and to update the values for 9
others. All are consistent with, and strengthen our previous conclusions,
supporting a dependence of f[ov] on mass that is now based on estimates for a
total of 50 binary systems (100 stars).

  galaxy luminosity functions","  The James Webb Space Telescop (JWST) promises to revolutionise our
understanding of the early Universe, and contrasting its upcoming observations
with predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model requires detailed theoretical
forecasts. Here, we exploit the large dynamic range of the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite, TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300, to derive multi-band galaxy
luminosity functions from $z=2$ to $z=10$. We put particular emphasis on the
exploration of different dust attenuation models to determine galaxy luminosity
functions for the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), and apparent wide NIRCam bands.
Our most detailed dust model is based on continuum Monte Carlo radiative
transfer calculations employing observationally calibrated dust properties.
This calibration results in constraints on the redshift evolution of the dust
attenuation normalisation and dust-to-metal ratios yielding a stronger redshift
evolution of the attenuation normalisation compared to most previous
theoretical studies. Overall we find good agreement between the rest-frame UV
luminosity functions and observational data for all redshifts, also beyond the
regimes used for the dust-model calibrations. Furthermore, we also recover the
observed high redshift ($z=4-6$) UV luminosity versus stellar mass relation,
the H$\alpha$ versus star formation rate relation, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity
function at $z=2$. The bright end ($M_{\rm UV}>-19.5$) cumulative galaxy number
densities are consistent with observational data. For the F200W NIRCam band, we
predict that JWST will detect $\sim 80$ ($\sim 200$) galaxies with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $10$ ($\sim 5$) within the NIRCam field of view,
$2.2\times2.2 \,{\rm arcmin}^{2}$, for a total exposure time of $10^5{\rm s}$

  Predictions Inside the CO Snowline","  CO is thought to be the main reservoir of volatile carbon in protoplanetary
disks, and thus the primary initial source of carbon in the atmospheres of
forming giant planets. However, recent observations of protoplanetary disks
point towards low volatile carbon abundances in many systems, including at
radii interior to the CO snowline. One potential explanation is that gas phase
carbon is chemically reprocessed into less volatile species, which are frozen
on dust grain surfaces as ice. This mechanism has the potential to change the
primordial C/H ratio in the gas. However, current observations primarily probe
the upper layers of the disk. It is not clear if the low volatile carbon
abundances extend to the midplane, where planets form. We have run a grid of
198 chemical models, exploring how the chemical reprocessing of CO depends on
disk mass, dust grain size distribution, temperature, cosmic ray and X-ray
ionization rate, and initial water abundance. Building on our previous work
focusing on the warm molecular layer, here we analyze the results for our grid
of models in the disk midplane at 12 au. We find that either an ISM level
cosmic ray ionization rate or the presence of UV photons due to a low dust
surface density are needed to chemically reduce the midplane CO gas abundance
by at least an order of magnitude within 1 Myr. In the majority of our models
CO does not undergo substantial reprocessing by in situ chemistry and there is
little change in the gas phase C/H and C/O ratios over the lifetime of the
typical disk. However, in the small sub-set of disks where the disk midplane is
subject to a source of ionization or photolysis, the gas phase C/O ratio
increases by up to nearly 9 orders of magnitude due to conversion of CO into
volatile hydrocarbons.

exhibited by state-of-the-art two-winged microrobots with the same size and
similar weight (i.e., the 75-mg Harvard RoboBee). The key innovation that made
possible the development of Bee$^+$ is the introduction of an extremely light
(28-mg) pair of twinned unimorph actuators, which enabled the design of a new
microrobotic mechanism that flaps four wings independently. A first main
advantage of the proposed design, compared to those of two-winged flyers, is
that by increasing the number of actuators from two to four, the number of
direct control inputs increases from three to four when simple sinusoidal
excitations are employed. A second advantage of Bee$^+$ is that its four-wing
configuration and flapping mode naturally damp the rotational disturbances that
commonly affect the yaw degree of freedom of two-winged microrobots. In
addition, the proposed design greatly reduces the complexity of the associated
fabrication process compared to those of other microrobots, as the unimorph
actuators are fairly easy to build. Lastly, we hypothesize that given the
relatively low wing-loading affecting their flapping mechanisms, the life
expectancy of Bee$^+$s must be considerably higher than those of the two-winged

Spitzer cryogenic mission Legacy program to map a region of the outer Milky Way
towards the Perseus and Outer spiral arms with the IRAC and MIPS instruments.
We identify 4648 YSOs across the field. Using the DBSCAN method we identify 68
clusters or aggregations of YSOs in the region, having 8 or more members. We
identify 1197 class Is, 2632 class IIs, 819 class IIIs, of which 45 are
candidate transition disk objects, utilizing the MIPS 24 photometry. The ratio
of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 2872/4648, or 62%. The ratios of
class I to class II YSOs in the clusters are broadly consistent with those
found in the inner galactic and nearby Gould's Belt young star formation
regions. The clustering properties indicate that the protostars may be more
tightly bound to their natal sites than the class IIs, and the class IIIs are
generally widely distributed. We further perform an analysis of the WISE data
of the SMOG field to determine how the lower resolution and sensitivity of WISE
affects the identification of YSOs as compared to Spitzer: we identify 931 YSOs
using combined WISE and 2MASS photometry, 931/4648 or 20% of the total number
identified with Spitzer. Performing the same clustering analysis finds 31
clusters which reliably trace the larger associations identified with the

distances from the WISE HII survey. SEDFitter modeling of these YSOs is
reported, leading to an estimation of the IMF in the aggregate of these

question by using our previously published catalogs of Mg, Si, Ca, Cr, Fe, Co,
and Ni abundances in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way to constrain the
mass at which the white dwarf explodes during a typical SN Ia. We fit a simple
bi-linear model to the evolution of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H], where X represents each
of the elements mentioned above. We use the evolution of [Mg/Fe] coupled with
theoretical supernova yields to isolate what fraction of the elements
originated in SNe Ia. Then, we infer the [X/Fe] yield of SNe Ia for all of the
elements except Mg. We compare these observationally inferred yields to recent
theoretical predictions for two classes of Chandrasekhar-mass (M_Ch) SN Ia as
well as sub-M_Ch SNe Ia. Most of the inferred SN Ia yields are consistent with
all of the theoretical models, but [Ni/Fe] is consistent only with sub-M_Ch
models. We conclude that the dominant type of SN Ia in ancient dwarf galaxies
is the explosion of a sub-M_Ch white dwarf. The Milky Way and dwarf galaxies

could indicate that the dominant class of SN Ia is different for galaxies where

the press, and are used in formal education, informal learning settings, and
all aspects of lifelong learning. In particular, visualizations of astronomical
data (hereafter astrovisualization or astroviz) have broadly captured the human
imagination, and are in high demand.
  Astrovisualization practitioners need a wide variety of specialized skills
and expertise spanning multiple disciplines (art, science, technology). As
astrophysics research continues to evolve into a more data rich science,
astroviz is also evolving from artists conceptions to data-driven
visualizations, from two-dimensional images to three-dimensional prints,
requiring new skills for development. Currently astroviz practitioners are
spread throughout the country. Due to the specialized nature of the field there
are seldom enough practitioners at one location to form an effective research
group for the exchange of knowledge on best practices and new techniques.
Because of the increasing importance of visualization in modern astrophysics,
the fact that the astroviz community is small and spread out in disparate
locations, and the rapidly evolving nature of this field, we argue for the
creation and nurturing of an Astroviz Community of Practice.
  We first summarize our recommendations. We then describe the current make-up

and measure the power-law slope $\gamma^{\prime}$ of the total density profile
for their main progenitors. We find that their $\gamma^{\prime}$ steepen on
average during $z\sim4-2$, then becoming shallower until $z=1$, after which
they remain almost constant, aside from a residual trend of becoming shallower
towards $z=0$. We also compare to a statistical sample of ETGs at different
redshifts, selected based on their luminosity profiles and stellar masses. Due
to different selection effects, the average slopes of the statistical samples
follow a modified evolutionary trend. They monotonically decrease since $z=3$,
and after $z\approx 1$, they remain nearly invariant with a mild increase
towards $z=0$. These evolutionary trends are mass-dependent for both samples,
with low-mass galaxies having in general steeper slopes than their more massive
counterparts. Galaxies that transitioned to ETGs more recently have steeper
mean slopes as they tend to be smaller and more compact at any given redshift.
By analyzing the impact of mergers and AGN feedback on the progenitors'
evolution, we conjecture a multi-phase path leading to isothermality in ETGs:
dissipation associated with rapid wet mergers tends to steepen
$\gamma^{\prime}$ from $z=4$ to $z=2$, whereas subsequent AGN feedback
(especially in the kinetic mode) makes $\gamma^{\prime}$ shallower again from
$z=2$ to $z=1$. Afterwards, passive evolution from $z=1$ to $z=0$, mainly
through gas-poor mergers, mildly decreases $\gamma^{\prime}$ and maintains the
overall mass distribution close to isothermal.

photoheating from young stars makes stellar feedback more efficient, but this

multi-phase structure of the ISM, however, is highly dependent on the strength
of the interstellar radiation field. We are also able to predict the
distribution of H$_2$, that allow us to match the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt
(KS) relation, without calibrating for it. We show that the dust distribution
is a complex function of density, temperature and ionization state of the gas

circular concentric ring formation perpendicular and parallel to the pore axis.

hitherto been unexplored in low-temperature photoionized plasmas. RER shares
similarities with dielectronic recombination, with the difference that the
electron is captured into a highly excited state below the ionization threshold

transitions of carbon and oxygen ions that are formed via the RER process, and
their relative strengths with collisional-radiative spectral models. Optical C
II RER features are detected in published high-resolution spectra of eight

are consistent with their production by this recombination mechanism. Because
RER has not previously been accounted for in photoionized plasmas, its
inclusion in models can significantly impact the predicted ionization balance

most probably not produced by the changes around the pulsation cycle. The X-ray
spectrum is soft (kT = 0.6 keV), with
  X-ray properties which are consistent with a young low mass companion.
Previously there was no evidence of a companion in radial velocities or in {\it

are very close or very distant, a binary companion at a separation between 30

http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11508v1,Characterizing hydrostatic mass bias with Mock-X,"  Surveys in the next decade will deliver large samples of galaxy clusters that
transform our understanding of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and
cosmology studies will become systematics limited with samples of this
magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters
provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this
is only realized if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way.
Here we introduce the \textsc{Mock-X} analysis framework, a multiwavelength
tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological simulations and derives
halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating
optical, Compton-$y$ and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image
analysis method, we demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring
hydrostatic mass bias for the IllustrisTNG, BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations.
Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant bias
$b\approx0.13$ with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or
subgrid physics. However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic
observations is mass-dependent, increasing to $b=0.3$ for the most massive
clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum
produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure
equilibrium. The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by
cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence.
The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical
method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current
observations and future surveys will contain sufficient samples of massive
clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic bias.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06857v1,CS Depletion in Prestellar Cores,"  The CS molecule is known to be absorbed onto dust in the cold and dense
conditions, causing it to get significantly depleted in the central region of
cores. This study is aimed to investigate the depletion of the CS molecule
using the optically thin C$^{34}$S molecular line observations. We mapped five
prestellar cores, L1544, L1552, L1689B, L694-2, and L1197 using two molecular
lines, C$^{34}$S $(J=2-1)$ and N$_2$H$^+$ $(J=1-0)$ with the NRO 45-m
telescope, doubling the number of cores where the CS depletion was probed using
C$^{34}$S. In most of our targets, the distribution of C$^{34}$S emission shows
features that suggest that the CS molecule is generally depleted in the center
of the prestellar cores. The radial profile of the CS abundance with respect to
H$_2$ directly measured from the CS emission and the Herschel dust emission
indicates that the CS molecule is depleted by a factor of $\sim$3 toward the
central regions of the cores with respect to their outer regions. The degree of
the depletion is found to be even more enhanced by an order of magnitude when
the contaminating effect introduced by the presence of CS molecules in the
surrounding envelope that lie along the line-of-sight is removed. Except for
L1197 which is classified as relatively the least evolved core in our targets
based on its observed physical parameters, we found that the remaining four
prestellar cores are suffering from significant CS depletion at their central
region regardless of the relative difference in their evolutionary status.

  Supernova Progenitors and New Evidence for a Mass-Spin Correlation","  Despite indications that superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) originate from
massive progenitors, the lack of a uniformly analyzed statistical sample has so
far prevented a detailed view of the progenitor mass distribution. Here we
present and analyze the pre-explosion mass distribution of hydrogen-poor SLSN
progenitors as determined from uniformly modelled light curves of 62 events. We
construct the distribution by summing the ejecta mass posteriors of each event,
using magnetar light curve models presented in our previous works (and using a
nominal neutron star remnant mass). The resulting distribution spans $3.6-40$
M$_{\odot}$, with a sharp decline at lower masses, and is best fit by a broken
power law described by ${\rm d}N/{\rm dlog}M \propto M^{-0.41 \pm 0.06}$ at
$3.6-8.6$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\propto M^{-1.26 \pm 0.06}$ at $8.6-40$ M$_{\odot}$.
We find that observational selection effects cannot account for the shape of
the distribution. Relative to Type Ib/c SNe, the SLSN mass distribution extends
to much larger masses and has a different power-law shape, likely indicating
that the formation of a magnetar allows more massive stars to explode as some
of the rotational energy accelerates the ejecta. Comparing the SLSN
distribution with predictions from single and binary star evolution models, we
find that binary models for a metallicity of $Z\lesssim 1/3$ Z$_{\odot}$ are
best able to reproduce its broad shape, in agreement with the preference of
SLSNe for low metallicity environments. Finally, we uncover a correlation
between the pre-explosion mass and the magnetar initial spin period, where
SLSNe with low masses have slower spins, a trend broadly consistent with the
effects of angular momentum transport evident in models of rapidly-rotating
carbon-oxygen stars.

rapid assembly. We use the wealth of information contained in the Galactic GC
population to quantify the properties of the satellite galaxies from which the
Milky Way assembled. To achieve this, we train an artificial neural network on
the E-MOSAICS cosmological simulations of the co-formation and co-evolution of
GCs and their host galaxies. The network uses the ages, metallicities, and
orbital properties of GCs that formed in the same progenitor galaxies to
predict the stellar masses and accretion redshifts of these progenitors. We
apply the network to Galactic GCs associated with five progenitors: {\it
Gaia}-Enceladus, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and the recently
discovered, `low-energy' GCs, which provide an excellent match to the predicted
properties of the enigmatic galaxy `Kraken'. The five galaxies cover a narrow
stellar mass range [$M_\star=(0.6{-}4.6)\times10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$], but have
widely different accretion redshifts ($z_{\rm acc}=0.57{-}2.65$). All accretion
events represent minor mergers, but Kraken likely represents the most major
merger ever experienced by the Milky Way, with stellar and virial mass ratios
of $r_{M_\star}=1$:$31^{+34}_{-16}$ and $r_{M_{\rm h}}=1$:$7^{+4}_{-2}$,
respectively. The progenitors match the $z=0$ relation between GC number and
halo virial mass, but have elevated specific frequencies, suggesting an
evolution with redshift. Even though these progenitors likely were the Milky
Way's most massive accretion events, they contributed a total mass of only
$\log{(M_{\rm \star,tot}/{\rm M}_\odot)}=9.0\pm0.1$, similar to the stellar
halo. This implies that the Milky Way grew its stellar mass mostly by in-situ
star formation. We conclude by organising these accretion events into the most
detailed reconstruction to date of the Milky Way's merger tree.

  galaxies from current observations","  The very first galaxies that started the cosmic dawn likely resided in
so-called ""minihaloes"", with masses of $\sim10^5$-$10^8\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
accreting their gas from the intergalactic medium through H$_2$ cooling. Such
molecularly cooled galaxies (MCGs) mostly formed in pristine environments,
hosted massive, metal-free stars, and were eventually sterilized by the
build-up of a disassociating (Lyman-Werner; LW) background. Therefore, their
properties might be very different from the galaxies we see in the later
Universe. Although MCGs are probably too faint to be observed directly, we
could nevertheless infer their properties from the imprint they leave in the
cosmic 21-cm signal. Here we quantify this imprint by extending the public
simulation code 21cmFAST to allow for a distinct population of MCGs. We allow
MCGs to have different properties from other galaxies, including unique scaling
relations for their stellar-to-halo mass ratios, ionizing escape fractions, and
spectral energy distributions. We track inhomogeneous recombinations,
disassociative LW feedback, and photoheating from reionization. After
demonstrating how MCGs can shape the 21-cm signal, we explore to what extent
current observations can already place constraints on their properties. The
cosmic microwave background optical depth from Planck sets an upper limit on
the product of the ionizing escape fraction and the stellar mass in MCGs. When
including also the timing of the putative EDGES absorption signal, we find an
additional strong degeneracy between the stellar mass and the X-ray luminosity
of MCGs. If proven to be of cosmic origin, the timing of the EDGES signal would
have been set by MCGs.

if the masses and radii are sufficiently precise and accurate. We aim to
measure precise masses and radii for the stars in the bright eclipsing binary

use several different methods to model the TESS light curve of AI Phe combined
with spectroscopic orbits from multiple sources to estimate precisely the
stellar masses and radii together with robust error estimates. We find that the
agreement between different methods for the light curve analysis is very good
but some methods underestimate the errors on the model parameters. The
semi-amplitudes of the spectroscopic orbits derived from spectra obtained with
modern echelle spectrographs are consistent to within 0.1%. The masses of the

obtained with modern echelle spectrographs. We provide recommendations for

far out of equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems.
Understanding and utilizing these interactions is crucial to photo-control of
quantum many-body states. One of the most surprising examples of strong mode
coupling is the interaction between apical oxygen phonons and Josephson
plasmons in bilayer YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ superconductors. Experiments by Hu
et al (2014). and Kaiser et al. (2014) showed that below Tc, photo-excitation
of phonons leads to enhancement and frequency shifts of Josephson plasmon
edges, while aboveTc, photo-excited phonons induce plasmon edges even when
there are no discernible features in the equilibrium reflectivity spectrum.
Recent experiments by Van Hoegen et al. (2019) also observed parametric
generation of Josephson plasmons from photo-excited phonons both below Tc and
in the pseudogap phase. In this paper we present a theoretical model of
phonon-plasmon three wave interaction arising from coupling between the oxygen
motion and the in-plane superfluid stiffness. Analysis of the parametric
instability of plasmons based on this model gives frequencies of the most
unstable plasmons that are in agreement with experimental observations. We also
discuss how strong parametric excitation of Josephson plasmons can explain pump
induced changes in the TeraHertz reflectivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ in the
superconducting state, including frequency shifts and sharpening of Josephson
plasmon edges, as well as appearance of a new peak around 2THz. An interesting
feature of this model is that overdamped Josephson plasmons do not give any
discernible features in reflectivity in equilibrium, but can develop plasmon
edges when parametrically excited. We suggest that this mechanism explains
photo-induced plasmon edges in the pseudogap phase of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$.

Surprisingly, none of them has the tangential velocity exceeding 20 km

  Convergence Power Spectrum from Strong Gravitational Lenses","  Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses have become a popular probe of dark
matter (DM) by providing a window into structure formation on the smallest
scales. In particular, the convergence power spectrum of subhalos within
lensing galaxies has been suggested as a promising observable to study DM.
However, the distances involved in strong-lensing systems are vast, and we
expect the relevant volume to contain line-of-sight (LOS) halos that are not
associated with the main lens. We develop a formalism to calculate the effect
of LOS halos as an effective convergence power spectrum. The multi-lens plane
equation couples the angular deflections of consecutive lens planes, but by
assuming that the perturbations due to the LOS halos are small, we show that
they can be projected onto the main-lens plane as effective subhalos. We test
our formalism by simulating lensing systems using the full multi-plane lens
equation and find excellent agreement. We show how the relative contribution of
LOS halos and subhalos depends on the source and lens redshift, as well as the
assumed halo and subhalo mass functions. For a fiducial system with fraction of
DM halo mass in substructure $f_{\rm sub}=0.4\%$ for subhalo masses
$[10^5-10^8]\rm{M}_{\odot}$, the interloper contribution to the power spectrum
is at least several times greater than that of subhalos for source redshifts
$z_s\gtrsim0.5$. Furthermore, it is likely that for the SLACS and BELLS lenses
the interloper contribution dominates: $f_{\rm sub}\gtrsim2\%$ ($4\%$) is
needed for subhalos to dominate in SLACS (BELLS), which is higher than current
upper bounds on $f_{\rm sub}$ for our mass range. Since the halo mass function
is better understood from first principles, the dominance of interlopers in
galaxy-galaxy lenses with high-quality imaging can be seen as a significant
advantage when translating this observable into a constraint on DM.

centroids at velocities between -10 and 20 km s-1 deviate from the disk plane,

activity, and were re-launched a decade ago. The predicted gamma-ray emission
from the lobes, based on an inverse Compton-emitting cocoon model, is three
orders of magnitude below the observed Fermi LAT flux. A comparison to other
Fermi-detected and non-Fermi detected CSOs with redshift z<0.1 indicates that
the gamma-ray emission likely originates in the inner jet/core region, and that
nearby, recently launched AGN jets are primary candidates for detection by the
Fermi LAT instrument.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00205v1,"Resolved Multi-element Stellar Chemical Abundances in the Brightest
  Quiescent Galaxy at z $\sim$ 2","  Measuring the chemical composition of galaxies is crucial to our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution models. However, such
measurements are extremely challenging for quiescent galaxies at high
redshifts, which have faint stellar continua and compact sizes, making it
difficult to detect absorption lines and nearly impossible to spatially resolve
them. Gravitational lensing offers the opportunity to study these galaxies with
detailed spectroscopy that can be spatially resolved. In this work, we analyze
deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the
brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1. Taking advantage of
full spectral fitting, we measure $[{\rm Mg/Fe}]=0.51\pm0.05$,
$[\rm{Fe/H}]=0.26\pm0.04$, and, for the first time, the stellar abundances of 6
other elements in this galaxy. We further constrained, also for the first time
in a $z\sim2$ galaxy, radial gradients in stellar age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe]. We
detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in
[Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies.
Our measurements show that not only is MRG-M0138 very Mg-enhanced compared to
the centers of local massive early-type galaxies, it is also very iron rich.
These dissimilar abundances suggest that even the inner regions of massive
galaxies have experienced significant mixing of stars in mergers, in contrast
to a purely inside-out growth model. The abundance pattern observed in
MRG-M0138 challenges simple galactic chemical evolution models that vary only
the star formation timescale and shows the need for more elaborate models.

states of magnetic topological materials. EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is an excellent
example, as it is predicted to have collinear antiferromagnetic order where the
magnetic moment direction determines either a topological-crystalline-insulator
phase supporting axion electrodynamics or a higher-order-topological-insulator

analysis, and density functional theory results to demonstrate that
EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ actually exhibits low-symmetry helical antiferromagnetic
order which makes it a stoichiometric magnetic topological-crystalline axion
insulator protected by the combination of a 180$^{\circ}$ rotation and
time-reversal symmetries: $C_{2}\times\mathcal{T}=2^{\prime}$. Surfaces
protected by $2^{\prime}$ are expected to have an exotic gapless Dirac cone
which is unpinned to specific crystal momenta. All other surfaces have gapped
Dirac cones and exhibit half-integer quantum anomalous Hall conductivity. We
predict that the direction of a modest applied magnetic field of $H\approx1$ to
$2$ T can tune between gapless and gapped surface states.

  Interactions in Global GRHD Simulations","  When a star passes close to a supermassive black hole (BH), the BH's tidal
forces rip it apart into a thin stream, leading to a tidal disruption event
(TDE). In this work, we study the post-disruption phase of TDEs in general
relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) using our GPU-accelerated code H-AMR. We
carry out the first grid-based simulation of a deep-penetration TDE ($\beta=7$)
with realistic system parameters: a black-hole-to-star mass ratio of $10^6$, a
parabolic stellar trajectory, and a nonzero BH spin. We also carry out the
first such simulation for a tilted TDE whose stellar orbit is inclined relative
to the BH midplane. We show that for our aligned TDE, an accretion disk forms
due to the dissipation of orbital energy, which is initially dominated by
violent self-intersections, and later by stream-disk interactions near the
pericenter, with $\sim20\%$ of the infalling material reaching the BH. The
self-intersections completely disrupt the stream, resulting in five distinct
self-intersection events separated by approximately 12 hours and a flaring in
the accretion rate. For our tilted TDE, we find only partial self-intersections
due to polar precession. Although they eject gas out of the orbital plane, an
accretion disk still forms with a similar accreted fraction of the material to
the aligned case. These results have important implications for disk formation
in realistic tidal disruptions. For instance, the periodicity in accretion rate
induced by the complete stream disruption may explain the flaring events from
Swift J1644+57.

  Betelgeuse","  The bright supergiant, Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis, HD 39801) experienced a
visual dimming during 2019 December and the first quarter of 2020 reaching an
historic minimum 2020 February 7$-$13. During 2019 September-November, prior to
the optical dimming event, the photosphere was expanding. At the same time,
spatially resolved ultraviolet spectra using the Hubble Space Telescope/Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph revealed a substantial increase in the
ultraviolet spectrum and Mg II line emission from the chromosphere over the
southern hemisphere of the star. Moreover, the temperature and electron density
inferred from the spectrum and C II diagnostics also increased in this
hemisphere. These changes happened prior to the Great Dimming Event. Variations
in the Mg II k-line profiles suggest material moved outwards in response to the
passage of a pulse or acoustic shock from 2019 September through 2019 November.
It appears that this extraordinary outflow of material from the star, likely
initiated by convective photospheric elements, was enhanced by the coincidence
with the outward motions in this phase of the $\sim$400 day pulsation cycle.
These ultraviolet observations appear to provide the connecting link between
the known large convective cells in the photosphere and the mass ejection event
that cooled to form the dust cloud in the southern hemisphere imaged in 2019
December, and led to the exceptional optical dimming of Betelgeuse in 2020
February.

Applications Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and
its partners in the newly formed Indian Sub-millimetre-wave Astronomy Alliance
(ISAA), to collaborate in the construction of a sub-millimeter-wave astronomy
observatory in the high altitude deserts of the Himalayas, initially at the
4500 m Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle. Two primary science goals are
targeted. One is the mapping of the distribution of neutral atomic carbon, and
the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule in higher energy states, in large parts of
the Milky Way, and in selected external galaxies. Such studies would advance
our understanding of molecular hydrogen present in the interstellar medium, but
partly missed by existing observations; and characterize Galaxy-wide molecular
cloud excitation conditions, through multi-level CO observations. Stars form in
interstellar clouds of molecular gas and dust, and these observations would
allow research into the formation and destruction processes of such molecular
clouds and the life cycle of galaxies. As the second goal, the observatory
would add a new location to the global Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) network,
which lacks a station in the Himalayan longitudes. This addition would enhance
the quality of the images synthesized by the EHT, support observations in
higher sub-millimeter wave bands, sharpening its resolving ability, improve its
dynamic imaging capability and add weather resilience to observing campaigns.
In the broader context, this collaboration can be a starting point for a wider,
mutually beneficial scientific exchange between the Indian and US astronomy
communities, including a potential future EHT space component.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10247v1,Monocular Reconstruction of Neural Face Reflectance Fields,"  The reflectance field of a face describes the reflectance properties
responsible for complex lighting effects including diffuse, specular,
inter-reflection and self shadowing. Most existing methods for estimating the
face reflectance from a monocular image assume faces to be diffuse with very
few approaches adding a specular component. This still leaves out important
perceptual aspects of reflectance as higher-order global illumination effects
and self-shadowing are not modeled. We present a new neural representation for
face reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance
responsible for the final appearance from a single monocular image. Instead of
modeling each component of the reflectance separately using parametric models,
our neural representation allows us to generate a basis set of faces in a
geometric deformation-invariant space, parameterized by the input light
direction, viewpoint and face geometry. We learn to reconstruct this
reflectance field of a face just from a monocular image, which can be used to
render the face from any viewpoint in any light condition. Our method is
trained on a light-stage training dataset, which captures 300 people
illuminated with 150 light conditions from 8 viewpoints. We show that our
method outperforms existing monocular reflectance reconstruction methods, in
terms of photorealism due to better capturing of physical premitives, such as
sub-surface scattering, specularities, self-shadows and other higher-order
effects.

halos in a sample of 25 Milky Way (MW) like galaxies in the TNG50 run of the
IllustrisTNG project. Using an Enclosed Volume Iterative Method, we infer an
oblate-triaxial shape for DM halos with a median $T\simeq 0.24$. we group DM
halos in 3 different classes. Simple halos(36%) establish three principal axes
whose ordering in magnitude does not change with radius and whose orientations
are almost fixed throughout the entirety of the halo. Twisted halos(36%) show
some levels of gradual rotations between 50 to 100 degs radially. Finally,
stretched halos(28%) demonstrate a stretching in their axes lengths where the
ordering of different eigenvalues change radially. And, the halo experiences a
`rotation' of $\sim$90 deg at that radius. Visualizing the 3D ellipsoid of DM
halos, for the first time, we report signs of a re-orienting ellipsoid in both
twisted and stretched classes. We examine the impact of baryonic physics on the
DM halo shape through a comparison to dark matter only (DMO) simulations. We
report a triaxial-prolate DM halo with a median $T\simeq 0.64$. Therefore
baryonic effects make DM halos less elongated. We analyze the impact of
substructure on the DM halo shape and confirm that it is subdominant. We study
the distribution of satellites with masses above $10^7 M_{\odot}$ and at the
distance of less than 200 kpc. Satellites in simple halos are in general closer
to the center and are more aligned with the central galaxy's angular momentum.
Satellites in twisted halo class, present a bi-modal behavior in the
distribution of their angles. Finally, satellites of stretched halos are
farther out from the center and are more misaligned. We connect the above
theoretical results to observations from the literature. Overlaying our
theoretical outcome with the observational results establishes a fair
agreement.

the emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner workings of stars, and
investigate the origin of planets. It will also create an integral-field
spectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local Group that is 1,000x
larger than the current state of the art and at high enough spatial resolution
to reveal the self-regulation mechanisms of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will
pioneer systematic, spectroscopic monitoring across the whole sky, revealing
changes on timescales from 20 minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track
the flickers, flares, and radical transformations of the most luminous
persistent objects in the universe: massive black holes growing at the centers
of galaxies.
  The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V will be unique among extant and future
spectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey infrastructures in
both hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical multi-object fiber
spectroscopy that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve high target densities,
targets of opportunity, and time-domain monitoring; and it provides optical,
ultra-wide-field integral field spectroscopy. SDSS-V, with its programs
anticipated to start in 2020, will be well-timed to multiply the scientific
output from major space missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based
projects. SDSS-V builds on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data
analysis, collaboration infrastructure, and product deliverables. The project
is now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies, and
developing new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We present
here an overview of the current state of these developments as we seek to build
our worldwide consortium of institutional and individual members.

the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and astrometric precision offered by
the next generation of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics will
help us answer these questions. First, it will be possible to obtain precision
measurements of stellar orbits in the Galaxy's central potential, providing
both tests of GR in the unexplored regime near a SMBH and measurements of the
extended dark matter distribution that is predicted to exist at the GC. Second,
we will probe stellar populations at the GC to significantly lower masses than
are possible today, down to brown dwarfs. Their structure and dynamics will
provide an unprecedented view of the stellar cusp around the SMBH and will
distinguish between models of star formation in this extreme environment. This
increase in depth will also allow us to measure the currently unknown
population of compact remnants at the GC by observing their effects on luminous
sources. Third, uncertainties on the mass of and distance to the SMBH can be
improved by a factor of $\sim$10. Finally, we can also study the near-infrared
accretion onto the black hole at unprecedented sensitivity and time resolution,
which can reveal the underlying physics of black hole accretion.

  Temperature-to-Polarization Leakage in the BK15 Dataset","  Precision measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
require extreme control of instrumental systematics. In a companion paper we
have presented cosmological constraints from observations with the BICEP2 and
Keck Array experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season (BK15),
resulting in the deepest CMB polarization maps to date and a statistical
sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\sigma(r) = 0.020$. In this work
we characterize the beams and constrain potential systematic contamination from
main beam shape mismatch at the three BK15 frequencies (95, 150, and 220 GHz).
Far-field maps of 7,360 distinct beam patterns taken from 2010-2015 are used to
measure differential beam parameters and predict the contribution of
temperature-to-polarization leakage to the BK15 B-mode maps. In the
multifrequency, multicomponent likelihood analysis that uses BK15, Planck, and
WMAP maps to separate sky components, we find that adding this predicted
leakage to simulations induces a bias of $\Delta r = 0.0027 \pm 0.0019$. Future
results using higher-quality beam maps and improved techniques to detect such
leakage in CMB data will substantially reduce this uncertainty, enabling the
levels of systematics control needed for BICEP Array and other experiments that
plan to definitively probe large-field inflation.

linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz).
The first observations began in September 2017, and observing for the survey

Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA
(Declination $>-40^{\circ}$), a total of 33,885 deg$^2$. The data will be taken
in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources.
The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength
astronomers, and citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an ""on the fly""
interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much reduced compared to a
conventional pointed survey. In this paper, we present the science case and

  2006","  Astrobiology, the study of life as a planetary phenomenon, aims to understand
the fundamental nature of life on earth and the possibility of life elsewhere.
To achieve this goal, astrobiologists have initiated unprecedented
communication between the disciplines of astronomy, biology, chemistry, and
geology. The Astrobiology Primer has been created as a reference tool for those
who are interested in the interdisciplinary field of astrobiology. The field
incorporates many diverse research endeavors, but it is our hope that this slim
volume will present the reader with all he or she needs to know to become
involved and to understand, at least at a fundamental level, the state of the
art. Because of the great diversity of material, each section was written by a
different author with a different expertise. The Primer was constructed
collaboratively. Ninety researchers from around the world contributed
information with regard to what they expected from other astrobiologists and
what they would like to know themselves but still had difficulty understanding
(see Contributors). Those submissions were read and considered by the Editors
who produced a list of seven general categories of knowledge, represented by
the seven chapters in the Primer: 1) Stellar Formation and Evolution, 2)
Planetary Formation and Evolution, 3) Astrobiogeochemistry and the Origin of
Life, 4) Evolution of Life through Time, 5) Planet Detection &
Characterization, 6) Diversity of Life, and 7) Science in Space. No one volume,
of course, can contain the vast amount of information brought to play in
astrobiology, but we believe that the Primer will provide a forum and a
language around which the community will have the opportunity to develop a
consensus about central issues.

  Searching for Color Outliers in SDSS and 2MASS","  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are
rich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure and
formation history of the Galaxy. As new surveys and instruments adopt similar
filter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of the
ugrizJHKs stellar locus, both to inform studies of `normal' main sequence stars
as well as for robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. Using a
sample of ~600,000 point sources detected by SDSS and 2MASS, we tabulate the
position and width of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus as a function of g-i color,
and provide accurate polynomial fits. We map the Morgan-Keenan spectral type
sequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectral
standards and by analyzing 3000 SDSS stellar spectra with a custom spectral
typing pipeline. We develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimum
separation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and use
it to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurious
SDSS/2MASS matches. Analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliers
identifies 370 white-dwarf/M dwarf (WDMD) pairs, 93 QSOs, and 90 M giant/carbon
star candidates, and demonstrates that WDMD pairs and QSOs can be distinguished
on the basis of their J-Ks and r-z colors. We also identify a group of objects
with correlated offsets in the u-g vs. g-r and g-r vs. r-i color-color spaces,
but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects.
Future applications of this algorithm to a matched SDSS-UKIDSS catalog may well
identify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areas
of color-magnitude space.

are not yet well understood since it is very hard to observe YSOs in the
protostellar phase. We study the X-ray properties of Class 0-I objects in the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and compare them with those of the more evolved
Class II and III members. Using Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) data, we
study the X-ray properties of stars in different evolutionary classes:
luminosities, NH, temperatures and time variability are compared in order to
understand if the interaction between the circumstellar material and the
central object can influence the X-ray emission. We have assembled the deepest
and most complete photometric catalog of objects in the ONC region from the UV
to 8 microns using data from HST, WFI@2.2m ESO and ISPI@4m CTIO telescopes, and
Spitzer IRAC. We select high probability candidate Class 0-I protostars,
distinguishing between those having a spectral energy distribution which rises
from K up to 8 microns (Class 0-Ia) from those where the SED rises from K up to
4.5 microns and decreasing afterwards (Class 0-Ib). We select a sample of bona
fide Class II stars and a set of Class III stars with IR emission consistent
with normal photospheres. Our principal result is that Class 0-Ia objects are
significantly less luminous in X-rays, both in the total and hard bands, than
the more evolved Class II stars with mass larger than 0.5 Msun; these latter
show X-ray luminosities similar to those of Class 0-Ib stars. This result
supports the hypothesis that the onset of X-ray emission occurs at a very early
stage of star formation. Temporal variability and spectral properties of Class
0-I stars are similar to those of the more evolved Class II and III objects,
except for a larger absorption likely due to gas in the circumstellar material.

  Brightest Explosion","  The first gamma-ray burst (GRB) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen with
the naked eye, GRB 080319B at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisite
follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. We present our
detailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over
5000 images starting 51 s after the GRB trigger, in concert with our own
analysis of the Swift data. The event is extreme not only in observed
properties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded at
optical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly high
isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. At early times, the
afterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,
but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. The overall spectral
energy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infrared
wavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction in
the host frame. The afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: starting
at about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red at
late times. In our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidence
for an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. Finally, we examine the
detectability of such events with current and future facilities and find that
such an event could be detected in gamma-rays by BAT out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),
while the nominal EXIST sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. At K band,
this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4717v1,How do Galaxies Accrete Gas and Form Stars?,"  Great strides have been made in the last two decades in determining how
galaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structures
we observe at z=0. The role of mergers has been documented through both
observations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent these
initial dark matter seeds have been discovered in the Local Group, high
redshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, and
the gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments.
Despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons are
still unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. One of the major problems is our
incomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequently
forms stars. Galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accurately
represent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observations
have only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range of
redshifts and environments. How galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form stars
is a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalactic
astrophysics. In this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area in
the next decade.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3899v1,Imaging an Event Horizon: submm-VLBI of a Super Massive Black Hole,"  A long standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe the immediate
environment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the event
horizon. Realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of General
Relativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at the
edge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental black
hole physics (e.g., spin). Steady long-term progress on improving the
capability of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at short wavelengths has
now made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the next
decade. The most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by
1.3mm VLBI of Schwarzschild radius scale structure in SgrA*, the compact source
of radio, submm, NIR and xrays at the center of the Milky Way. SgrA* is thought
to mark the position of a ~4 million solar mass black hole, and because of its
proximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon size
of any black hole candidate in the Universe. Over the next decade, existing and
planned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, high
angular resolution ""Event Horizon Telescope"" that will bring us as close to the
edge of black hole as we will come for decades. This white paper describes the
science case for mm/submm VLBI observations of both SgrA* and M87 (a radio loud
AGN of a much more luminous class that SgrA*). We emphasize that while there is
development and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, and
the recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that would
normally be associated with such an ambitious project.

Variable R71, supernova remnant N49, a large number of young stellar objects,

use the spectra to constrain the presence and temperature of cold dust and the
excitation conditions and shocks within the neutral and ionized gas, in the
circumstellar environments and interfaces with the surrounding ISM. Evolved
stars, including LBV R71, lack cold dust except in some cases where we argue
that this is swept-up ISM. This leads to an estimate of the duration of the
prolific dust-producing phase (""superwind"") of several thousand years for both
RSGs and massive AGB stars, with a similar fractional mass loss experienced
despite the different masses. We tentatively detect line emission from neutral
oxygen in the extreme RSG WOHG064, with implications for the wind driving. In
N49, the shock between the supernova ejecta and ISM is revealed by its strong
[OI] 63-micron emission and possibly water vapour; we estimate that 0.2 Msun of
ISM dust was swept up. Some of the compact HII regions display pronounced
[OIII] 88-micron emission. The efficiency of photo-electric heating in the
interfaces of ionized gas and molecular clouds is estimated at 0.1-0.3%. We
confirm earlier indications of a low nitrogen content in the LMC. Evidence for
solid state emission features is found in both young and evolved object; some

  Hydrogen and Helium Recombination Lines","  We have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at
the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses
of the black holes in 12 nearby (z < 0.05) Seyfert 1 galaxies with expected
masses in the range ~10^6-10^7M_sun and also the well-studied nearby active
galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including
NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the
monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the
continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad
Hbeta emission, which we have previously reported. We present here the light
curves for the Halpha, Hgamma, HeII 4686, and HeI 5876 emission lines and the
time lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuum
flux. Combining each emission-line time lag with the measured width of the line
in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine a virial mass of the central
supermassive black hole from several independent emission lines. We find that
the masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. The time-lag
response as a function of velocity across the Balmer line profiles is examined
for six of the AGNs. Finally we compare several trends seen in the dataset
against the predictions from photoionization calculations as presented by
Korista & Goad. We confirm several of their predictions, including an increase
in responsivity and a decrease in the mean time lag as the excitation and
ionization level for the species increases. Further confirmation of
photoionization predictions for broad-line gas behavior will require additional
monitoring programs for these AGNs while they are in different luminosity
states. [abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4318v2,LBT/LUCIFER Observations of the z~2 Lensed Galaxy J0900+2234,"  We present rest-frame optical images and spectra of the gravitationally
lensed, star-forming galaxy J0900+2234 (z=2.03). The observations were
performed with the newly commissioned LUCIFER1 near-infrared instrument mounted
on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We fit lens models to the rest-frame
optical images and find the galaxy has an intrinsic effective radius of 7.4 kpc
with a lens magnification factor of about 5 for the A and B components. We also
discovered a new arc belonging to another lensed high-z source galaxy, which
makes this lens system a potential double Einstein ring system. Using the high
S/N rest-frame optical spectra covering H+K band, we detected Hbeta, OIII,
Halpha, NII and SII emission lines. Detailed physical properties of this high-z
galaxy were derived. The extinction towards the ionized HII regions (E_g(B-V))
is computed from the flux ratio of Halpha and Hbeta and appears to be much
higher than that towards stellar continuum (E_s(B-V)), derived from the optical
and NIR broad band photometry fitting. The metallicity was estimated using N2
and O3N2 indices. It is in the range of 1/5-1/3 solar abundance, which is much
lower than the typical z~2 star-forming galaxies. From the flux ratio of SII
6717 and 6732, we found that the electron number density of the HII regions in
the high-z galaxy were >1000 cm^-3, consistent with other z~2 galaxies but much
higher than that in local HII regions. The star-formation rate was estimated
via the Halpha luminosity, after correction for the lens magnification, to be
about 365\pm69 Msun/yr. Combining the FWHM of Halpha emission lines and the
half-light radius, we found the dynamical mass of the lensed galaxy is
5.8\pm0.9x10^10 Msun. The gas mass is 5.1\pm1.1x10^10~Msun from the H\alpha
flux surface density by using global Kennicutt-Schmidt Law, indicating a very
high gas fraction of 0.79\pm0.19 in J0900+2234.

  The Rate-Size Relation, and the Rates as a Function of Galaxy Hubble Type and
  Colour","  This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements of
the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from
the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have considered a sample of
about 1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe
Ibc, and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as
a function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as
luminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass, and morphological class. We
discuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions,
inclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their
uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements
shows that they are consistent with each other to within uncertainties when the
rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data
demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter
using either galaxy Hubble types or B - K colours. A secondary parameter in
galaxy ""size"", expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately
describe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes
have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN
rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We
examine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation
for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the
specific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether
the same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component
(""tardy"" and ""prompt"") model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in
young stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the
core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric and Milky Way rates ... (abridged)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2674v2,Ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type Ic supernovae,"  Recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group of
extremely luminous optical transients. The initial discoveries of SN 2005ap by
the Texas Supernova Search and SCP-06F6 in a deep Hubble pencil beam survey
were followed by the Palomar Transient Factory confirmation of host redshifts
for other similar transients. The transients share the common properties of
high optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and a
lack of H or He spectral features. The physical mechanism that produces the
luminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion to
pulsational pair-instability. Here we report the most detailed photometric and
spectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (SN 2010gx) detected in the
Pan-STARRS 1 sky survey. In common with other transients in this family,
early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption lines
of O II. However, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type Ic
supernova features, showing the characteristic broad Fe II and Si II absorption
lines. Detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all SN 2005ap and
SCP-06F6 type transients are linked to supernovae Ic. This poses problems in
understanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication from
late-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56Ni, the broad
lightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolution
is quite different from typical Ic timescales. The nature of the progenitor
stars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3183v1,"The Properties of the Interstellar Medium within a Star-Forming Galaxy
  at z=2.3","  We present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas emission in the
rest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3
sub-millimetre galaxy SMM J2135-0102. We obtain very high signal-to-noise
detections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20
transitions from 9 species. We use the 12CO, [CI] and HCN line strengths to
investigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ISM)
chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,
dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitation
massive component. Employing photo-dissociation region models we show that on
average the molecular gas is exposed to a UV radiation field that is ~1000 x
more intense than the Milky Way, with star-forming regions having a
characteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. These conditions are similar to those
found in local ULIRGs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,
even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. The 12CO
spectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence that
the system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,
including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray flux
within clouds. We show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas and
star-formation surface densities appear to follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our data
suggest that this relation breaks down on scales of <100pc. By virtue of the
lens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on the
star formation and ISM at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recently
become possible at z<0.1, and show the potential physical properties that will
be studied in unlensed galaxies when ALMA is in full operation. (Abridged).

keV (rest frame) space density of X-ray selected AGNs detected in the Chandra
COSMOS survey. The sample comprises 81 X-ray detected sources with available
spectroscopic (31) and photometric (50) redshifts plus 20 sources with a formal
z_phot<3 but with a broad photometric redshift probability distribution, such
that z_phot+1sigma>3. 81 sources are selected in the 0.5-2 keV band, 14 are
selected in the 2-10 keV and 6 in the 0.5-10 keV bands. We sample the high
luminosity (log L_(2-10 keV)>44.15 erg/s) space density up to z~5 and a fainter
luminosity range (43.5<log L(2-10 keV)<44.15 erg/s) than previous studies, up
to z=3.5. We weighted the contribution to the number counts and the space
density of the sources with photometric redshift by using their probability of
being at z>3. We find that the space density of high-luminosity AGNs declines
exponentially at all the redshifts, confirming the trend observed for optically
selected quasars. At lower luminosity, the measured space density is not
conclusive, and a larger sample of faint sources is needed. Comparisons with
optical luminosity functions and BH formation models are presented together
with prospects for future surveys.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6058v3,"The stellar masses and specific star-formation rates of submillimetre
  galaxies","  Establishing the stellar masses (M*), and hence specific star-formation rates
(sSFRs) of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) is crucial for determining their role
in the cosmic galaxy/star formation. However, there is as yet no consensus over
the typical M* of SMGs. Specifically, even for the same set of SMGs, the
reported average M* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from ~5x10^10 Mo to
~5x10^11 Mo. Here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to such
widely varying results. We find that, contrary to recent claims in the
literature, potential contamination of IRAC 3-8 um photometry from hot dust
associated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the published
discrepancies in derived M*. Instead, we expose in detail how inferred M*
depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify the
individual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial mass
function, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and different
forms of assumed star-formation history. We review current observational
evidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from the
hydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choices
of these model inputs, the average M* of SMGs is ~2x10^11 Mo. We also confirm
that this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latest
measurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving M* function of the
overall galaxy population. M* of this order imply that the average sSFR of SMGs
is comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z>2, at 2-3 Gyr^-1.
This supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any M*, most
SMGs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at
these redshifts. Conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint that
SMGs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmic
history of star-formation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0716v1,Radio Astronomy in LSST Era,"  A community meeting on the topic of ""Radio Astronomy in the LSST Era"" was
hosted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, VA (2013
May 6--8). The focus of the workshop was on time domain radio astronomy and sky
surveys. For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength
observations are required to understand several classes of transients was
stressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible
wavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.
From the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1
million alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification
and identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can
warrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a
deep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion
objects in it. Deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on a
comparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are part
of the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand these
objects. Radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dust
obscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formation
and from active galactic nuclei. The workshop touched on several other topics,
on which there was consensus including the placement of other LSST ""Deep
Drilling Fields,"" inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge of
filtering and exploiting the LSST data stream. There were also topics for which
there was insufficient time for full discussion or for which no consensus was
reached, which included the procedures for following up on LSST observations
and the nature for future support of researchers desiring to use LSST data
products.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0947v1,Characterization of the Benchmark Binary NLTT 33370,"  We report the confirmation of the binary nature of the nearby, very low-mass
system NLTT 33370 with adaptive optics imaging and present resolved
near-infrared photometry and integrated light optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy to characterize the system. VLT-NaCo and LBTI-LMIRCam images show
significant orbital motion between 2013 February and 2013 April. Optical
spectra reveal weak, gravity sensitive alkali lines and strong lithium 6708
Angstrom absorption that indicate the system is younger than field age.
VLT-SINFONI near-IR spectra also show weak, gravity sensitive features and
spectral morphology that is consistent with other young, very low-mass dwarfs.
We combine the constraints from all age diagnostics to estimate a system age of
~30-200 Myr. The 1.2-4.7 micron spectral energy distribution of the components
point toward T_eff=3200 +/- 500 K and T_eff=3100 +/- 500 K for NLTT 33370 A and
B, respectively. The observed spectra, derived temperatures, and estimated age
combine to constrain the component spectral types to the range M6-M8.
Evolutionary models predict masses of 113 +/- 8 M_Jup and 106 +/- 7 M_Jup from
the estimated luminosities of the components. KPNO-Phoenix spectra allow us to
estimate the systemic radial velocity of the binary. The Galactic kinematics of
NLTT 33370AB are broadly consistent with other young stars in the Solar
neighborhood. However, definitive membership in a young, kinematic group cannot
be assigned at this time and further follow-up observations are necessary to
fully constrain the system's kinematics. The proximity, age, and late-spectral
type of this binary make it very novel and an ideal target for rapid, complete
orbit determination. The system is one of only a few model calibration
benchmarks at young ages and very low-masses.

QSO IRAS 13349+2438. Optical spectra reveal extreme Eigenvector-1
characteristics, but the H-beta line width argues against a NLS1
classification; we refine z=0.10853 based on [O III]. We estimate a BH
mass=10^9 Msun using 2 independent methods (H-beta line width & SED fits).
Blue-shifted absorption (-950km/s & -75km/s) is seen for the 1st time in STIS
UV spectra from Ly-alpha, NV, & CIV. The higher velocity UV lines are
coincident with the lower-ionisation (xi~1.6) X-ray warm absorber lines. A
dusty multiple ionization absorber blueshifted by 700-900km/s is required to
fit the X-ray data. Theoretical models comparing different ionising SEDs reveal
that a UV-inclusive (i.e., the accretion disc) ionising continuum strongly
impacts conclusions for the thermodynamic stability of the warm absorber.
Specific to IRAS13349, an Xray-UV ionising SED favors a continuous distribution
of ionisation states in a smooth flow (this paper), versus discrete clouds in
pressure equilibrium (work by others where UV is omitted). Direct dust
detections are seen in both the IR: PAH emission at (7.7 & 11.3)micron which
may also be blended with forsterite, and (10 & 18)micron silicate emission, and
X-rays: iron dust with a dust-to-gas ratio > 90%. We develop a geometrical
model whereby the QSO nuclear region is viewed through the upper atmosphere of
an obscuring torus. This sight line is obscured by dust that blocks a direct
view of the UV/optical emission region but is largely transparent in X-rays
since the gas is ionised. In our model, 20% of the intrinsic UV/optical
continuum is scattered into our sight line by the far wall of an obscuring
torus. An additional 2.4% of the direct light, which likely dominates the UV
emission, is Thomson-scattered into our line-of-sight by another off-plane
component of highly ionized gas.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2292v2,NuSTAR J163433-4738.7: A Fast X-ray Transient in the Galactic Plane,"  During hard X-ray observations of the Norma spiral arm region by the Nuclear
Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) in 2013 February, a new transient
source, NuSTAR J163433-4738.7, was detected at a significance level of 8-sigma
in the 3-10 keV bandpass. The source is consistent with having a constant
NuSTAR count rate over a period of 40 ks and is also detected simultaneously by
Swift at lower significance. The source is not significantly detected by
NuSTAR, Swift, or Chandra in the days before or weeks after the discovery of
the transient, indicating that the strong X-ray activity lasted for between
~0.5 and 1.5 days. Near-IR imaging observations were carried out before and
after the X-ray activity, but we are not able to identify the counterpart. The
combined NuSTAR and Swift energy spectrum is consistent with a power-law with a
photon index of Gamma = 4.1(+1.5)(-1.0) (90% confidence errors), a blackbody
with kT = 1.2+/-0.3 keV, or a bremsstrahlung model with kT = 3.0(+2.1)(-1.2)
keV. The reduced-chi2 values for the three models are not significantly
different, ranging from 1.23 to 1.44 for 8 degrees of freedom. The spectrum is
strongly absorbed with NH = 2.8(+2.3)(-1.4)e23 cm-2, 9(+15)(-7)e22 cm-2, and
1.7(+1.7)(-0.9)e23 cm-2, for the power-law, blackbody, and bremsstrahlung
models, respectively. Although the high column density could be due to material
local to the source, it is consistent with absorption from interstellar
material along the line of sight at a distance of 11 kpc, which would indicate
an X-ray luminosity >1e34 erg/s. Although we do not reach a definitive
determination of the nature of NuSTAR J163433-4738.7, we suggest that it may be
an unusually bright active binary or a magnetar.

  II. The Nondip Spectrum in the Low/Hard State - Modulations with Orbital
  Phase","  The accretion onto the black hole in the system HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 is
powered by the strong line driven stellar wind of the O-type donor star. We
study the X-ray properties of the stellar wind in the hard state of Cyg X-1 as
determined with data from the Chandra High Energy Transmission Gratings. Large
density and temperature inhomogeneities are present in the wind, with a
fraction of the wind consisting of clumps of matter with higher density and
lower temperature embedded in a photoionized gas. Absorption dips observed in
the light curve are believed to be caused by these clumps. This work
concentrates on the non-dip spectra as a function of orbital phase. The spectra
show lines of H-like and He-like ions of S, Si, Na, Mg, Al and highly ionized
Fe (Fe xvii-Fe xxiv). We measure velocity shifts, column densities, and thermal
broadening of the line series. The excellent quality of these five observations
allows us to investigate the orbital phase dependence of these parameters. We
show that the absorber is located close to the black hole. Doppler shifted
lines point at a complex wind structure in this region, while emission lines
seen in some observations are from a denser medium than the absorber. The
observed line profiles are phase dependent. Their shapes vary from pure,
symmetric absorption at the superior conjunction to P Cygni profiles at the
inferior conjunction of the black hole.

  Target Selection","  As part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV the extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will improve measurements of the cosmological
distance scale by applying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method to
quasar samples. eBOSS will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq.
deg. First, a ""CORE"" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugriz
using a likelihood-based routine called XDQSOz, with a mid-IR-optical
color-cut. eBOSS CORE selection (to g < 22 OR r < 22) should return ~ 70
quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 < z < 2.2 and ~7 z > 2.1 quasars per sq.
deg. Second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from the
Palomar Transient Factory should recover an additional ~3-4 z > 2.1 quasars per
sq. deg. to g < 22.5. A linear model of how imaging systematics affect target
density recovers the angular distribution of eBOSS CORE quasars over 96.7%
(76.7%) of the SDSS North (South) Galactic Cap area. The eBOSS CORE quasar
sample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 < z < 2.2 to
yield the first few-percent-level BAO constraint near z~1.5. eBOSS quasars at z
> 2.1 will be used to improve BAO measurements in the Lyman-alpha Forest.
Beyond its key cosmological goals, eBOSS should be the next-generation quasar
survey, comprising > 500,000 new quasars and > 500,000 uniformly selected
spectroscopically confirmed 0.9 < z < 2.2 quasars. At the conclusion of eBOSS,
the SDSS will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4302v3,BICEP2 II: Experiment and Three-Year Data Set,"  We report on the design and performance of the BICEP2 instrument and on its
three-year data set. BICEP2 was designed to measure the polarization of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) on angular scales of 1 to 5 degrees
($\ell$=40-200), near the expected peak of the B-mode polarization signature of
primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inflation. Measuring B-modes
requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control
of systematics. The BICEP2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26~cm
aperture and cold, on-axis, refractive optics. BICEP2 also adopted a new
detector design in which beam-defining slot antenna arrays couple to
transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers, all fabricated on a common substrate.
The antenna-coupled TES detectors supported scalable fabrication and
multiplexed readout that allowed BICEP2 to achieve a high detector count of 500
bolometers at 150 GHz, giving unprecedented sensitivity to B-modes at degree
angular scales. After optimization of detector and readout parameters, BICEP2
achieved an instrument noise-equivalent temperature of 15.8 $\mu$K sqrt(s). The
full data set reached Stokes Q and U map depths of 87.2 nK in square-degree
pixels (5.2 $\mu$K arcmin) over an effective area of 384 square degrees within
a 1000 square degree field. These are the deepest CMB polarization maps at
degree angular scales to date. The power spectrum analysis presented in a
companion paper has resulted in a significant detection of B-mode polarization
at degree scales.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3806v1,"ZFOURGE/CANDELS: On the Evolution of M* Galaxy Progenitors from z=3 to
  0.5","  Galaxies with stellar masses near M* contain the majority of stellar mass in
the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy
evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present day stellar
masses near M*, at 5x10^10 Msol (MW-mass) and 10^11 Msol (M31-mass). We study
the typical progenitors of these galaxies using ZFOURGE, a deep medium-band
near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies
out to z~3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main
progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in
the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and
star-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR
HST imaging from CANDELS, and far-IR imaging from GOODS-H and CANDELS-H. The
typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution
stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,
to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and to
red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the
MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower
redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than the
progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution,
including the suppression of star-formation in present-day M* galaxies requires
an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold
for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and star-formation rates imply that
the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to
z~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the S\'ersic index.
Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M* galaxies corresponds to a rapid
decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formation
efficiency.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06780v1,The Accreting Black Hole Swift J1753.5-0127 from Radio to Hard X-Ray,"  (abridged) We report on multi-wavelength measurements of Swift J1753.5-0127
in the hard state at L=2.7e36 erg/s (assuming d=3 kpc) in 2014. The radio
emission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. We take
advantage of the low extinction and model the near-IR to UV emission with a
multi-temperature disk model. Assuming a BH mass of M_BH=5 Msun and a system
inclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk of
Rin/Rg>212 d_3 (5Msun/M_BH). The outer radius is R_out/R_g=90,000 d_3
(5Msun/M_BH), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expected
size of the disk. The 0.5-240 keV spectrum measured by Swift/XRT, Suzaku, and
NuSTAR is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index of
Gamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a second
continuum component is added. Reflection is a possibility, but no iron line is
detected, implying a low iron abundance. We are able to fit the entire SED with
a multi-temperature disk component, a Comptonization component, and a broken
power-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. The broken power-law
cannot significantly contribute to the soft X-ray emission, and this may be
related to why Swift J1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/X-ray correlation.
The broken power-law might dominate above 20 keV, which would constrain the
break frequency to be between 2.4e10 Hz and 3.6e12 Hz. Although the fits to the
full SED do not include significant thermal emission in the X-ray band,
previous observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find that
there is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with a
temperature of 150(+30)(-20) eV and an inner radius of 5-14 R_g. If this
component is real, it might imply the presence of an inner accretion disk in
addition to the strongly truncated (R_in>212 R_g) disk.

for accreting X-ray pulsars, consisting of a simple power law with an
exponential cutoff starting at ~7 keV with a folding energy of E_fold=~18 keV.
There is also an indication of the presence of a 6.4 keV iron line in the
spectrum at the ~3 sigma significance level. NuSTAR measurements of the
pulsation period reveal that the pulsar has undergone a strong and steady
spin-up for the last 20 years. The pulsed fraction is estimated to be ~80%, and
is constant with energy up to 40 keV. The power density spectrum shows a break
towards higher frequencies relative to the current spin period. This, together
with steady persistent luminosity, points to a long-term mass accretion rate
high enough to bring the pulsar out of spin equilibrium.

Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observations
collected in a multi-wavelength campaign with UV data using the Hubble Space

behavior during the epoch of our observations. Our analysis of the
Chandra-HETGS spectra yields complex absorption lines from H-like and He-like
ions of Ne, Mg and Si which confirm the presence of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO)
with a velocity ~ $-$17,300 km s$^{-1}$ (outflow redshift $z_{\rm out}$ ~
$-$0.0561) in the rest frame of PG 1211+143. This absorber is well described by
an ionization parameter $\log \xi$ ~ 2.9 erg s$^{-1}$ cm and column density
$\log N_{\rm H}$ ~ 21.5 cm$^{-2}$. This corresponds to a stable region of the
absorber's thermal stability curve, and furthermore its implied neutral
hydrogen column is broadly consistent with a broad Ly$\alpha$ absorption line
at a mean outflow velocity of ~ $-$16,980 km s$^{-1}$ detected by our HST-COS

in both X-ray and UV observations. Our VLA observations provide evidence for an

  using NH3","  We present combined observations of the NH3 (J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversion
transitions towards OMC1 in Orion A obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA) and the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). With an
angular resolution of 6"" (0.01 pc), these observations reveal with
unprecedented detail the complex filamentary structure extending north of the
active Orion BN/KL region in a field covering 6' x 7'. We find a 0.012 pc wide
filament within OMC1, with an aspect ratio of ~37:1, that was missed in
previous studies. Its orientation is directly compared to the relative
orientation of the magnetic field from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope BISTRO
survey in Orion A. We find a small deviation of ~11 deg between the mean
orientation of the filament and the magnetic field, suggesting that they are
almost parallel to one another. The filament's column density is estimated to
be 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than the filaments studied with Herschel and
is possibly self-gravitating given the low values of turbulence found. We
further produce maps of the gas kinematics by forward modeling the hyperfine
structure of the NH3 (J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) lines. The resulting distribution
of velocity dispersions peaks at ~0.5 km/s, close to the subsonic regime of the
gas. This value is about 0.2 km/s smaller than previously measured in
single-dish observations of the same region, suggesting that higher angular and
spectral resolution observations will identify even lower velocity dispersions
that might reach the subsonic turbulence regime in dense gas filaments.

  Demonstration Experiments","  We present the screenplay of a physics show on particle physics, by the
Physikshow of Bonn University. The show is addressed at non-physicists aged 14+
and communicates basic concepts of elementary particle physics including the
discovery of the Higgs boson in an entertaining fashion. It is also
demonstrates a successful outreach activity heavily relying on the university
physics students. This paper is addressed at anybody interested in particle
physics and/or show physics. This paper is also addressed at fellow physicists
working in outreach, maybe the experiments and our choice of simple
explanations will be helpful. Furthermore, we are very interested in related
activities elsewhere, in particular also demonstration experiments relevant to
particle physics, as often little of this work is published.
  Our show involves 28 live demonstration experiments. These are presented in
an extensive appendix, including photos and technical details. The show is set
up as a quest, where 2 students from Bonn with the aid of a caretaker travel
back in time to understand the fundamental nature of matter. They visit
Rutherford and Geiger in Manchester around 1911, who recount their famous
experiment on the nucleus and show how particle detectors work. They travel
forward in time to meet Lawrence at Berkeley around 1950, teaching them about
the how and why of accelerators. Next, they visit Wu at DESY, Hamburg, around
1980, who explains the strong force. They end up in the LHC tunnel at CERN,
Geneva, Switzerland in 2012. Two experimentalists tell them about colliders and
our heroes watch live as the Higgs boson is produced and decays. The show was
presented in English at Oxford University and University College London, as
well as Padua University and ICTP Trieste. It was 1st performed in German at
the Deutsche Museum, Bonn (5/'14). The show has eleven speaking parts and
involves in total 20 people.

= 0.308), MACSJ0416, (z = 0.396) and MACSJ1149 (z = 0.543). Statistically
resolving dark-matter subhaloes down to ~10^{9.5} solar masses, we compare the
derived subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) to theoretical predictions from
analytical models and with numerical simulations in a Lambda Cold Dark Matter
(LCDM) cosmology. Mimicking our observational cluster member selection criteria
in the HSTFF, we report excellent agreement in both amplitude and shape of the
SHMF over four decades in subhalo mass (10^{9-13} solar masses). Projection
effects do not appear to introduce significant errors in the determination of
SHMFs from simulations. We do not find evidence for a substructure crisis,
analogous to the missing satellite problem in the Local Group, on cluster
scales, but rather excellent agreement of the count-matched HSTFF SHMF down to
M_{sub halo}/M_{halo} ~ 10^{-5}. However, we do find discrepancies in the
radial distribution of sub haloes inferred from HSTFF cluster lenses compared
to determinations from simulated clusters. This suggests that although the
selected simulated clusters match the HSTFF sample in mass, they do not
adequately capture the dynamical properties and complex merging morphologies of
these observed cluster lenses. Therefore, HSTFF clusters are likely observed in
a transient evolutionary stage that is presently insufficiently sampled in
cosmological simulations. The abundance and mass function of dark matter
substructure in cluster lenses continues to offer an important test of the LCDM
paradigm, and at present we find no tension between model predictions and
observations.

All-sky Near-infrared Optical SETI (PANOSETI) observatory will be a dedicated

near-infrared (NIR) is a promising way to significantly reduce the systematic
errors, as the strategy minimizes our reliance on the empirical
width-luminosity relation and uncertain dust laws. Observations in the NIR are
also crucial for our understanding of the origins and evolution of these
events, further improving their cosmological utility. Any future experiments in
the rest-frame NIR will require knowledge of the SN Ia NIR spectroscopic
diversity, which is currently based on a small sample of observed spectra.
Along with the accompanying paper, Phillips et al. (2018), we introduce the
Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), to follow up nearby SNe Ia in both the
optical and the NIR. In particular, this paper focuses on the CSP-II NIR
spectroscopy program, describing the survey strategy, instrumental setups, data
reduction, sample characteristics, and future analyses on the data set. In
collaboration with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA)
Supernova Group, we obtained 661 NIR spectra of 157 SNe Ia. Within this sample,
451 NIR spectra of 90 SNe Ia have corresponding CSP-II follow-up light curves.
Such a sample will allow detailed studies of the NIR spectroscopic properties
of SNe Ia, providing a different perspective on the properties of the unburned
material, radioactive and stable nickel produced, progenitor magnetic fields,
and searches for possible signatures of companion stars.

with stellar mass $10^{10.7}\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \leqslant M_{\ast} \leqslant
10^{11.9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, the total power-law slope has a mean of
$\langle\gamma^{\prime}\rangle = 2.011 \pm 0.007$ and a scatter of
$\sigma_{\gamma^{\prime}} = 0.171$ over the radial range 0.4 to 4 times the
stellar half mass radius. Several correlations between $\gamma^{\prime}$ and
galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius, stellar surface
density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction and
in-situ-formed stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other
simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG reproduces many correlation trends,
and in particular, $\gamma^{\prime}$ is almost constant with redshift below $z
= 2$. Through analyzing IllustrisTNG model variations we show that black hole
kinetic winds are crucial to lowering $\gamma^{\prime}$ and matching observed
galaxy correlations. The effects of stellar winds on $\gamma^{\prime}$ are
subdominant compared to AGN feedback, and differ due to the presence of AGN
feedback from previous works. The density profiles of the ETG dark matter halos
are well-described by steeper-than-NFW profiles, and they are steeper in the
full physics (FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter only (DMO)
run. Their inner density slopes anti-correlates (remain constant) with the halo
mass in the FP (DMO) run, and anti-correlates with the halo concentration
parameter $c_{200}$ in both types of runs. The dark matter halos of low-mass
ETGs are contracted whereas high-mass ETGs are expanded, suggesting that
variations in the total density profile occur through the different halo
responses to baryons.

  Observations and the Earliest Spectropolarimetry","  The non-detection of companion stars in Type Ia supernova (SN) progenitor
systems lends support to the notion of double-degenerate (DD) systems and
explosions triggered by the merging of two white dwarfs. This very asymmetric
process should lead to a conspicuous polarimetric signature. By contrast,
observations consistently find very low continuum polarization as the
signatures from the explosion process largely dominate over the pre-explosion
configuration within several days. Critical information about the interaction
of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is encoded in the
early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of
SN\,2018gv with the ESO Very Large Telescope at $-$13.6 days relative to the
$B-$band maximum light, or $\sim$5 days after the estimated explosion --- the
earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date of any Type Ia SN. These
early observations still show a low continuum polarization ($\lesssim$0.2\%)
and moderate line polarization (0.30$\pm$0.04\% for the prominent \ion{Si}{2}
$\lambda$6355 feature and 0.85$\pm$0.04\% for the high-velocity Ca component).
The high degree of spherical symmetry implied by the low line and continuum
polarization at this early epoch is consistent with explosion models of delayed
detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. The
dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first
$\sim$100 days after the maximum light indicate that SN\,2018gv is a normal
Type Ia SN with similar spectrophotometric behavior to SN\,2011fe.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11130v1,Imprint of Drivers of Galaxy Formation in the Circumgalactic Medium,"  The majority of baryons reside beyond the optical extent of a galaxy in the
circumgalactic and intergalactic media (CGM/IGM). Gaseous halos are
inextricably linked to the appearance of their host galaxies through a complex
story of accretion, feedback, and continual recycling. The energetic processes,
which define the state of gas in the CGM, are the same ones that 1) regulate
stellar growth so that it is not over-efficient, and 2) create the diversity of
today's galaxy colors, SFRs, and morphologies spanning Hubble's Tuning Fork
Diagram. They work in concert to set the speed of growth on the star-forming
Main Sequence, transform a galaxy across the Green Valley, and maintain a
galaxy's quenched appearance on the Red Sequence. Most baryons in halos more
massive than 10^12 Msolar along with their high-energy physics and dynamics
remain invisible because that gas is heated above the UV ionization states. We
argue that information on many of the essential drivers of galaxy evolution is
primarily contained in this ""missing"" hot gas phase. Completing the picture of
galaxy formation requires uncovering the physical mechanisms behind stellar and
SMBH feedback driving mass, metals, and energy into the CGM. By opening
galactic hot halos to new wavebands, we not only obtain fossil imprints of >13
Gyrs of evolution, but observe on-going hot-mode accretion, the deposition of
superwind outflows into the CGM, and the re-arrangement of baryons by SMBH
feedback. A description of the flows of mass, metals, and energy will only be
complete by observing the thermodynamic states, chemical compositions,
structure, and dynamics of T>=10^6 K halos. These measurements are uniquely
possible with a next-generation X-ray observatory if it provides the
sensitivity to detect faint CGM emission, spectroscopic power to measure
absorption lines and gas motions, and high spatial resolution to resolve
structures.

changed our perception of the universe and humanity's place within it. Recent
work indicates that a solar system's X-ray and high energy particle environment
is of fundamental importance to the formation and development of the
atmospheres of close-in planets such as hot Jupiters, and Earth-like planets
around M stars. X-ray imaging and spectroscopy provide powerful and unique
windows into the high energy flux that an exoplanet experiences, and X-ray
photons also serve as proxies for potentially transfigurative coronal mass
ejections. Finally, if the host star is a bright enough X-ray source, transit
measurements akin to those in the optical and infrared are possible and allow
for direct characterization of the upper atmospheres of exoplanets. In this
brief white paper, we discuss contributions to the study of exoplanets and
their environs which can be made by X-ray data of increasingly high quality
that are achievable in the next 10--15 years.

  Neutrinos","  To facilitate multimessenger studies with TeV and PeV astrophysical
neutrinos, the IceCube Collaboration has developed a realtime alert system for
the highest confidence and best localized neutrino events. In this work we
investigate the likelihood of association between realtime high-energy neutrino
alerts and explosive optical transients, with a focus on core-collapse
supernovae (CC SNe) as candidate neutrino sources. We report results from
triggered optical follow-up observations of two IceCube alerts, IC170922A and
IC171106A, with Blanco/DECam ($gri$ to 24th magnitude in $\sim6$ epochs). Based
on a suite of simulated supernova light curves, we develop and validate
selection criteria for CC SNe exploding in coincidence with neutrino alerts.
The DECam observations are sensitive to CC SNe at redshifts $z \lesssim 0.3$.
At redshifts $z \lesssim 0.1$, our selection criteria reduce background SNe
contamination to a level below the predicted signal. For the IC170922A
(IC171106A) follow-up observations, we expect that 12.1% (9.5%) of coincident
CC SNe at $z \lesssim 0.3$ are recovered, and that on average, 0.23 (0.07)
unassociated SNe in the 90% containment regions also pass our selection
criteria. We find two total candidate CC SNe that are temporally coincident
with the neutrino alerts, but none in the 90% containment regions, which is
statistically consistent with expected rates of background CC SNe for these
observations. Given the signal efficiencies and background rates derived from
this pilot study, we estimate that to determine whether CC SNe are the dominant
contribution to the total TeV-PeV energy IceCube neutrino flux at the $3\sigma$
confidence level, DECam observations similar to those of this work would be
needed for $\sim200$ neutrino alerts, though this number falls to $\sim60$
neutrino alerts if redshift information is available for all candidates.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01597v1,ALMA resolves the hourglass magnetic field in G31.41+0.31,"  Context. Submillimeter Array (SMA) 870 micron polarization observations of
the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 revealed one of the clearest examples up to
date of an hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology in a high-mass
star-forming region. Aims. To better establish the role that the magnetic field
plays in the collapse of G31.41+0.31, we carried out Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the polarized dust
continuum emission at 1.3 mm with an angular resolution four times higher than
that of the previous (sub)millimeter observations to achieve an unprecedented
image of the magnetic field morphology. Methods. We used ALMA to perform full
polarization observations at 233 GHz (Band 6). The resulting synthesized beam
is 0.28""x0""20 which, at the distance of the source, corresponds to a spatial
resolution of ~875 au. Results. The observations resolve the structure of the
magnetic field in G31.41+0.31 and allow us to study the field in detail. The
polarized emission in the Main core of G31.41+0.41is successfully fit with a
semi-analytical magnetostatic model of a toroid supported by magnetic fields.
The best fit model suggests that the magnetic field is well represented by a
poloidal field with a possible contribution of a toroidal component of ~10% of
the poloidal component, oriented southeast to northwest at ~ -44 deg and with
an inclination of ~-45 degr. The magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to
the northeast to southwest velocity gradient detected in this core on scales
from 1E3-1E4 au. This supports the hypothesis that the velocity gradient is due
to rotation and suggests that such a rotation has little effect on the magnetic
field. The strength of the magnetic field estimated in the central region of
the core with the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method is ~8-13 mG and implies that
the mass-to-flux ratio in this region is slightly supercritical ...

  Cloud","  We have investigated the formation and kinematics of sub-mm continuum cores
in the Orion A molecular cloud. A comparison between sub-mm continuum and near
infrared extinction shows a continuum core detection threshold of $A_V\sim$
5-10 mag. The threshold is similar to the star formation extinction threshold
of $A_V\sim$ 7 mag proposed by recent work, suggesting a universal star
formation extinction threshold among clouds within 500 pc to the Sun. A
comparison between the Orion A cloud and a massive infrared dark cloud
G28.37+0.07 indicates that Orion A produces more dense gas within the
extinction range 15 mag $\lesssim A_V \lesssim$ 60 mag. Using data from the
CARMA-NRO Orion Survey, we find that dense cores in the integral-shaped
filament (ISF) show sub-sonic core-to-envelope velocity dispersion that is
significantly less than the local envelope line dispersion, similar to what has
been found in nearby clouds. Dynamical analysis indicates that the cores are
bound to the ISF. An oscillatory core-to-envelope motion is detected along the
ISF. Its origin is to be further explored.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07538v1,Dynamical Relics of the Ancient Galactic Halo,"  We search for dynamical substructures in the LAMOST DR3 very metal-poor (VMP)
star catalog. After cross-matching with Gaia DR2, there are 3300 VMP stars with
available high-quality astrometric information that have halo-like kinematics.
We apply a method based on self-organizing maps to find groups clustered in the
4D space of orbital energy and angular momentum. We identify 57 dynamically
tagged groups, which we label DTG-1 to DTG-57. Most of them belong to existing
substructures in the nearby halo, such as the $Gaia$ Sausage or Sequoia. The
stream identified by Helmi et al. is recovered, but the two disjoint portions
of the substructure have distinct dynamical properties. The very retrograde
substructure Rg5 found previously by Myeong et al. is also retrieved. We report
6 new DTGs with highly retrograde orbits, 2 with very prograde orbits, and 12
with polar orbits. By mapping other datasets (APOGEE halo stars, and catalogs
of r-process-enhanced and CEMP stars) onto the trained neuron map, we can
associate stars with detailed chemical abundances to the DTGs, and look for
associations with chemically peculiar stars. The highly eccentric $Gaia$
Sausage groups contain representatives both of debris from the satellite itself
(which is $\alpha$-poor) and the Splashed Disk, sent up into eccentric halo
orbits from the encounter (and is $\alpha$-rich). The new prograde
substructures also appear to be associated with the Splashed Disk. The DTGs
belonging to the $Gaia$ Sausage host two relatively metal-rich $r$-II stars and
six CEMP stars in different sub-classes, consistent with the idea that the
$Gaia$ Sausage progenitor is a massive dwarf galaxy. Rg5 is dynamically
associated with two highly $r$-process-enhanced stars with [Fe/H] $\sim -$3.
This finding indicates that its progenitor might be an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy
that has experienced $r$-process enrichment from neutron star mergers.

  of high precision astrometry","  Sky survey telescopes and powerful targeted telescopes play complementary
roles in astronomy. In order to investigate the nature and characteristics of
the motions of very faint objects, a flexibly-pointed instrument capable of
high astrometric accuracy is an ideal complement to current astrometric surveys
and a unique tool for precision astrophysics. Such a space-based mission will
push the frontier of precision astrometry from evidence of earth-massed
habitable worlds around the nearest starts, and also into distant Milky way
objects up to the Local Group of galaxies. As we enter the era of the James
Webb Space Telescope and the new ground-based, adaptive-optics-enabled giant
telescopes, by obtaining these high precision measurements on key objects that
Gaia could not reach, a mission that focuses on high precision astrometry
science can consolidate our theoretical understanding of the local universe,
enable extrapolation of physical processes to remote redshifts, and derive a
much more consistent picture of cosmological evolution and the likely fate of
our cosmos. Already several missions have been proposed to address the science
case of faint objects in motion using high precision astrometry ESA missions:
NEAT for M3, micro-NEAT for S1 mission, and Theia for M4 and M5. Additional new
mission configurations adapted with technological innovations could be
envisioned to pursue accurate measurements of these extremely small motions.
The goal of this white paper is to address the fundamental science questions
that are at stake when we focus on the motions of faint sky objects and to
briefly review quickly instrumentation and mission profiles.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12739v1,The Case for Probe-class NASA Astrophysics Missions,"  Astrophysics spans an enormous range of questions on scales from individual
planets to the entire cosmos. To address the richness of 21st century
astrophysics requires a corresponding richness of telescopes spanning all bands
and all messengers. Much scientific benefit comes from having the
multi-wavelength capability available at the same time. Most of these bands,or
measurement sensitivities, require space-based missions. Historically, NASA has
addressed this need for breadth with a small number of flagship-class missions
and a larger number of Explorer missions. While the Explorer program continues
to flourish, there is a large gap between Explorers and strategic missions. A
fortunate combination of new astrophysics technologies with new, high capacity,
low dollar-per-kg to orbit launchers, and new satellite buses allow for cheaper
missions with capabilities approaching strategic mission levels. NASA has
recognized these developments by calling for Probe-class mission ideas for
mission studies, spanning most of the electromagnetic spectrum from GeV
gamma-rays to the far infrared, and the new messengers of neutrinos and
ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The key insight from the Probes exercise is that
order-of-magnitude advances in science performance metrics are possible across
the board for initial total cost estimates in the range 500M-1B dollars.

secondary eclipses and were monitored throughout TESS Cycle 1 (sectors 1-13),
falling within the TESS Continuous Viewing Zone. In one eclipsing binary (P =

secondary eclipse; in the other (P = 5.674 d) both eclipses are grazing. Using
these data, spectroscopy, speckle photometry, SED analysis and evolutionary
stellar tracks, we have constrained the masses and radii of the four stars in
the two eclipsing binaries. The Li I EW indicates an age of 10-50 Myr and, with
an outer period of $858^{+7}_{-5}$ days, our analysis indicates this is one of

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11358v1,A possible polar origin for the FRB associated with a Galactic magnetar,"  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-long radio pulses of extragalactic
origin with peak luminosities far exceeding any Milky Way sources. The
prevalent invocation for the FRB origin involves magnetars: young, magnetically
powered neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. A
magnetar-defining signature is the emission of bright, hard X-ray bursts of
sub-second duration. These occur in isolation or during a burst storm, when
several hundred are observed within minutes to hours. On April 27th 2020, the
Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active period, emitting hundreds of
X-ray bursts in a few hours. Remarkably, only one of these temporally coincided
with an FRB-like radio burst. Here we report on the spectral and temporal
analyses of 24 X-ray bursts emitted 13 hours prior to the FRB and seen
simultaneously with NASA NICER and Fermi/GBM missions in their combined energy
range. We demonstrate that the FRB-associated X-ray burst is very similar
temporally, albeit strikingly different spectrally, from the 24 NICER/GBM
bursts. If the FRB-associated burst were drawn from this magnetar burst
population, its occurrence rate would be at most around 1 in 7000. This rarity
combined with the unusual X-ray burst spectrum is perhaps indicative of an
uncommon locale for the origin of the FRB-associated burst. We suggest that
this unique event originated in quasi-polar open or closed magnetic field lines
extending to high altitudes where radio emission can be generated, possibly
from a collimated plasma flow.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01950v1,"Ultra-high spatial resolution BOLD fMRI in humans using combined
  segmented-accelerated VFA-FLEET with a recursive RF pulse design","  Purpose
  To alleviate the spatial encoding limitations of single-shot EPI by
developing multi-shot segmented EPI for ultra-high-resolution fMRI with reduced
ghosting artifacts from subject motion and respiration.
  Methods
  Segmented EPI can reduce readout duration and reduce acceleration factors,
however, the time elapsed between segment acquisitions (on the order of
seconds) can result in intermittent ghosting, limiting its use for fMRI. Here,
""FLEET"" segment ordering--where segments are looped over before slices--was
combined with a variable flip angle progression (VFA-FLEET) to improve
inter-segment fidelity and maximize signal for fMRI. Scaling a sinc pulse's
flip angle for each segment (VFA-FLEET-Sinc) produced inconsistent slice
profiles and ghosting, therefore, a recursive Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) RF pulse
design was developed (VFA-FLEET-SLR) to generate unique pulses for every
segment that together produce consistent slice profiles and signals.
  Results
  The temporal stability of VFA-FLEET-SLR was compared against
conventional-segmented EPI and VFA-FLEET-Sinc at 3 T and 7 T. VFA-FLEET-SLR
showed reductions in both intermittent and stable ghosting compared to
conventional-segmented and VFA-FLEET-Sinc, resulting in improved image quality
with a minor trade-off in temporal SNR. Combining VFA-FLEET-SLR with
acceleration, we achieved a 0.6-mm isotropic acquisition at 7 T--without zoomed
imaging or partial Fourier--demonstrating reliable detection of BOLD responses
to a visual stimulus. To counteract the increased repetition time from
segmentation, simultaneous multi-slice VFA-FLEET-SLR was demonstrated using
RF-encoded controlled aliasing.
  Conclusions
  VFA-FLEET with a recursive RF pulse design supports acquisitions with low
levels of artifact and spatial blur, enabling fMRI at previously inaccessible
spatial resolutions with a ""full-brain"" field of view.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11373v1,X-ray Spectral and Timing evolution of MAXI J1727-203 with NICER,"  We present a detailed X-ray spectral and variability study of the full 2018
outburst of MAXI J1727-203 using NICER observations. The outburst lasted
approximately four months. Spectral modelling in the 0.3-10 keV band shows the
presence of both a soft thermal and a hard Comptonised component. The analysis
of these components shows that MAXI J1727-203 evolved through the soft,
intermediate and hard spectral states during the outburst. We find that the
soft (disc) component was detected throughout almost the entire outburst, with
temperatures ranging from ~0.4 keV, at the moment of maximum luminosity, to
~0.1 keV near the end of the outburst. The power spectrum in the hard and
intermediate states shows broadband noise up to 20 Hz, with no evidence of
quasi-periodic oscillations. We also study the rms spectra of the broadband
noise at 0.3-10 keV of this source. We find that the fractional rms increases
with energy in most of the outburst except during the hard state, where the
fractional rms remains approximately constant with energy. We also find that,
below 3 keV, the fractional rms follows the same trend generally observed at
energies >3 keV, a behaviour known from previous studies of black holes and
neutron stars. The spectral and timing evolution of MAXI J1727-203, as
parametrised by the hardness-intensity, hardness-rms, and rms-intensity
diagrams, suggest that the system hosts a black hole, although we could not
rule out a neutron star.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13144v1,"PTF11rka: an interacting supernova at the crossroads of
  stripped-envelope and H-poor super-luminous stellar core collapses","  The hydrogen-poor supernova PTF11rka (z = 0.0744), reported by the Palomar
Transient Factory, was observed with various telescopes starting a few days
after the estimated explosion time of 2011 Dec. 5 UT and up to 432 rest-frame
days thereafter. The rising part of the light curve was monitored only in the
R_PTF filter band, and maximum in this band was reached ~30 rest-frame days
after the estimated explosion time. The light curve and spectra of PTF11rka are
consistent with the core-collapse explosion of a ~10 Msun carbon-oxygen core
evolved from a progenitor of main-sequence mass 25--40 Msun, that liberated a
kinetic energy (KE) ~ 4 x 10^{51} erg, expelled ~8 Msun of ejecta (Mej), and
synthesised ~0.5 Msun of 56Nichel. The photospheric spectra of PTF11rka are
characterised by narrow absorption lines that point to suppression of the
highest ejecta velocities ~>15,000 km/s. This would be expected if the ejecta
impacted a dense, clumpy circumstellar medium. This in turn caused them to lose
a fraction of their energy (~5 x 10^50 erg), less than 2% of which was
converted into radiation that sustained the light curve before maximum
brightness. This is reminiscent of the superluminous SN 2007bi, the light-curve
shape and spectra of which are very similar to those of PTF11rka, although the
latter is a factor of 10 less luminous and evolves faster in time. PTF11rka is
in fact more similar to gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) in luminosity,
although it has a lower energy and a lower KE/Mej ratio.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0003v1,"The Lick AGN Monitoring Project: Broad-Line Region Radii and Black Hole
  Masses from Reverberation Mapping of Hbeta","  We have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at
the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses
of the black holes in 12 nearby (z < 0.05) Seyfert 1 galaxies with expected
masses in the range ~10^6-10^7 M_sun and also the well-studied nearby active
galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including
NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the
monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the
continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad
Hbeta emission. We present here the light curves for the objects in this sample
and the subsequent Hbeta time lags for the nine objects where these
measurements were possible. The Hbeta lag time is directly related to the size
of the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured width
of the Hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine
the virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine AGNs. The
absolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalization
derived by Onken et al. We also examine the time lag response as a function of
velocity across the Hbeta line profile for six of the AGNs. The analysis of
four leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function of
velocity. However, SBS 1116+583A exhibits a symmetric time lag response around
the line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-line
region (BLR) clouds, and Arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is most
easily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. Further investigation
will be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical models
of the BLR by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2363v3,"SN 2010ay is a Luminous and Broad-lined Type Ic Supernova within a
  Low-metallicity Host Galaxy","  We report on our serendipitous pre-discovery detection and detailed follow-up
of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) 2010ay at z = 0.067 imaged by the
Pan-STARRS1 3pi survey just ~4 days after explosion. The SN had a peak
luminosity, M_R ~ -20.2 mag, significantly more luminous than known GRB-SNe and
one of the most luminous SNe Ib/c ever discovered. The absorption velocity of
SN 2010ay is v_Si ~ 19,000 km/s at ~40 days after explosion, 2-5 times higher
than other broad-lined SNe and similar to the GRB-SN 2010bh at comparable
epochs. Moreover, the velocity declines ~2 times slower than other SNe Ic-BL
and GRB-SNe. Assuming that the optical emission is powered by radioactive
decay, the peak magnitude implies the synthesis of an unusually large mass of
56 Ni, M_Ni = 0.9 M_solar. Modeling of the light-curve points to a total ejecta
mass, M_ej ~ 4.7 M_sol, and total kinetic energy, E_K ~ 11x10^51 ergs. The
ratio of M_Ni to M_ej is ~2 times as large for SN 2010ay as typical GRB-SNe and
may suggest an additional energy reservoir. The metallicity (log(O/H)_PP04 + 12
= 8.19) of the explosion site within the host galaxy places SN 2010ay in the
low-metallicity regime populated by GRB-SNe, and ~0.5(0.2) dex lower than that
typically measured for the host environments of normal (broad-lined) Ic
supernovae. We constrain any gamma-ray emission with E_gamma < 6x10^{48} erg
(25-150 keV) and our deep radio follow-up observations with the Expanded Very
Large Array rule out relativistic ejecta with energy, E > 10^48 erg. We
therefore rule out the association of a relativistic outflow like those which
accompanied SN 1998bw and traditional long-duration GRBs, but place
less-stringent constraints on a weak afterglow like that seen from XRF 060218.
These observations challenge the importance of progenitor metallicity for the
production of a GRB, and suggest that other parameters also play a key role.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3985v3,BICEP2 I: Detection Of B-mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales,"  (abridged for arXiv) We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a cosmic
microwave background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the
signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around
$\ell\sim80$. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting
optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition
edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of
$\approx300\mu\mathrm{K}_\mathrm{CMB}\sqrt{s}$. BICEP2 observed from the South
Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with
an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in
Stokes $Q$ and $U$. We find an excess of $B$-mode power over the base
lensed-LCDM expectation in the range $30< \ell< 150$, inconsistent with the
null hypothesis at a significance of $> 5\sigma$. Through jackknife tests and
simulations we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the
observed excess. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust
emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power
$\sim(5-10)\times$ smaller than the observed excess signal. However, these
models are not sufficiently constrained to exclude the possibility of dust
emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating
BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is
confirmed and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the
CMB, disfavoring dust at $1.7\sigma$. The observed $B$-mode power spectrum is
well fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0\sigma$.
Accounting for the contribution of foreground dust will shift this value
downward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.

  Survey: Simulations to Correct Supernova Distance Biases","  We describe catalog-level simulations of Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) light
curves in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN), and in
low-redshift samples from the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the Carnegie
Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model biases from
selection effects and light curve analysis, and to determine bias corrections
for SN~Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To
generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN~Ia model,
incorporates information from observations (PSF, sky noise, zero point), and
uses summary information (e.g., detection efficiency vs. signal to noise ratio)
based on 10,000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and
processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is
illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within
redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up to 0.05~mag over the redshift
ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly
those with extreme red or blue color, distance biases can reach 0.4~mag.
Therefore, accurately determining bias corrections is critical for precision
measurements of cosmological parameters. Files used to make these corrections
are available at https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/sn.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04184v1,"HARPS-N Solar Radial-Velocity Variations Are Dominated By Large, Bright
  Magnetic Regions","  State of the art radial-velocity (RV) exoplanet searches are currently
limited by RV signals arising from stellar magnetic activity. We analyze solar
observations acquired over a 3-year period during the decline of Carrington
Cycle 24 to test models of RV variation of Sun-like stars. A purpose-built
solar telescope at the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the
Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) provides disk-integrated solar spectra, from
which we extract RVs and $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$. The Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) provides disk-resolved images of magnetic activity. The Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) provides near-continuous solar photometry,
analogous to a Kepler light curve. We verify that the SORCE photometry and
HARPS-N $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$ correlate strongly with the SDO-derived magnetic
filling factor, while the HARPS-N RV variations do not. To explain this
discrepancy, we test existing models of RV variations. We estimate the
contributions of the suppression of convective blueshift and the rotational
imbalance due to brightness inhomogeneities to the observed HARPS-N RVs. We
investigate the time variation of these contributions over several rotation
periods, and how these contributions depend on the area of active regions. We
find that magnetic active regions smaller than $60 \ \rm Mm^2$ do not
significantly suppress convective blueshift. Our area-dependent model reduces
the amplitude of activity-induced RV variations by a factor of two. The present
study highlights the need to identify a proxy that correlates specifically with
large, bright magnetic regions on the surfaces of exoplanet-hosting stars.

Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its concept is based on a
two-mirror optical system designed to improve the telescope field of view and
image resolution with respect to the single mirror Davies-Cotton solution. The
SCT camera is planned to be instrumented with 177 photodetection modules, each
composed of 64 Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. The third generation of
$6 x 6~mm^2$ high density NUV SiPMs (NUV-HD3) produced by Fondazione Bruno
Kessler (FBK) in collaboration with INFN has been used to equip optical units
to be integrated on the upgrade of the camera of the SCT prototype (pSCT). Each
optical unit is composed of an array of 16 NUV-HD3 SiPMs coupled with the
front-end electronics, which is designed for full-waveform nanosecond readout
and digitization using the TARGET-7 ASIC. Several optical units have been
assembled and tested in the laboratories of INFN and have been integrated on
the camera of the pSCT telescope, that is currently operating at the Fred
Lawrence Whipple Observatory. In this contribution we report on the
development, assembly and calibration of the optical units that are currently
taking data on the pSCT camera.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05618v1,Noise from Undetected Sources in Dark Energy Survey Images,"  For ground-based optical imaging with current CCD technology, the Poisson
fluctuations in source and sky background photon arrivals dominate the noise
budget and are readily estimated. Another component of noise, however, is the
signal from the undetected population of stars and galaxies. Using injection of
artificial galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of
galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark
Energy Survey (DES) images is significantly in excess of the Poisson
predictions, by up to 30\%, and that the background sky levels are
overestimated by current software. By cross-correlating distinct images of
""empty"" sky regions, we establish that there is a significant image noise
contribution from undetected static sources (US), which on average are mildly
resolved at DES resolution. Treating these US as a stationary noise source, we
compute a correction to the moment covariance matrix expected from Poisson
noise. The corrected covariance matrix matches the moment variances measured on
the injected DES images to within 5\%. Thus we have an empirical method to
statistically account for US in weak lensing measurements, rather than
requiring extremely deep sky simulations. We also find that local sky
determinations can remove the bias in flux measurements, at a small penalty in
additional, but quantifiable, noise.

  VHE observations during an extreme flaring activity in April 2013","  We report on a multi-band variability and correlation study of the TeV blazar
Mrk 421 during an exceptional flaring activity observed from 2013 April 11 to
2013 April 19. The study uses, among others, data from GASP-WEBT, Swift,
NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and MAGIC. The large blazar activity, and the 43
hours of simultaneous NuSTAR and MAGIC/VERITAS observations, permitted
variability studies on 15 minute time bins, and over three X-ray bands (3-7
keV, 7-30 keV and 30-80 keV) and three very-high-energy (>0.1 TeV, hereafter
VHE) gamma-ray bands (0.2-0.4 TeV, 0.4-0.8 TeV and >0.8 TeV). We detected
substantial flux variations on multi-hour and sub-hour timescales in all the
X-ray and VHE gamma-ray bands. The characteristics of the sub-hour flux
variations are essentially energy-independent, while the multi-hour flux
variations can have a strong dependence on the energy of the X-ray and the VHE
gamma rays. The three VHE bands and the three X-ray bands are positively
correlated with no time-lag, but the strength and the characteristics of the
correlation changes substantially over time and across energy bands. Our
findings favour multi-zone scenarios for explaining the achromatic/chromatic
variability of the fast/slow components of the light curves, as well as the
changes in the flux-flux correlation on day-long timescales. We interpret these
results within a magnetic reconnection scenario, where the multi-hour flux
variations are dominated by the combined emission from various plasmoids of
different sizes and velocities, while the sub-hour flux variations are
dominated by the emission from a single small plasmoid moving across the
magnetic reconnection layer.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07984v3,"TOI-503: The first known brown dwarf-Am star binary from the TESS
  mission","  We report the discovery of an intermediate-mass transiting brown dwarf,
TOI-503b, from the TESS mission. TOI-503b is the first brown dwarf discovered
by TESS and orbits a metallic-line A-type star with a period of $P=3.6772 \pm
0.0001$ days. The light curve from TESS indicates that TOI-503b transits its
host star in a grazing manner, which limits the precision with which we measure
the brown dwarf's radius ($R_b = 1.34^{+0.26}_{-0.15} R_J$). We obtained
high-resolution spectroscopic observations with the FIES, Ond\v{r}ejov, PARAS,
Tautenburg, and TRES spectrographs and measured the mass of TOI-503b to be $M_b
= 53.7 \pm 1.2 M_J$. The host star has a mass of $M_\star = 1.80 \pm 0.06
M_\odot$, a radius of $R_\star = 1.70 \pm 0.05 R_\odot$, an effective
temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 7650 \pm 160$K, and a relatively high metallicity
of $0.61\pm 0.07$ dex. We used stellar isochrones to derive the age of the
system to be $\sim$180 Myr, which places its age between that of RIK 72b (a
$\sim$10 Myr old brown dwarf in the Upper Scorpius stellar association) and AD
3116b (a $\sim$600 Myr old brown dwarf in the Praesepe cluster). We argue that
this brown dwarf formed in-situ, based on the young age of the system and the
long circularization timescale for this brown dwarf around its host star.
TOI-503b joins a growing number of known short-period, intermediate-mass brown
dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars, and is the second such brown dwarf known
to transit an A star, after HATS-70b. With the growth in the population in this
regime, the driest region in the brown dwarf desert ($35-55 M_J \sin{i}$) is
reforesting and its mass range shrinking.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00050v1,"A DESGW Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart to the LIGO/Virgo
  Gravitational Wave Binary Neutron Star Merger Candidate S190510g","  We present the results from a search for the electromagnetic counterpart of
the LIGO/Virgo event S190510g using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). S190510g is
a binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate of moderate significance detected
at a distance of 227$\pm$92 Mpc and localized within an area of 31 (1166)
square degrees at 50\% (90\%) confidence. While this event was later classified
as likely non-astrophysical in nature within 30 hours of the event, our short
latency search and discovery pipeline identified 11 counterpart candidates, all
of which appear consistent with supernovae following offline analysis and
spectroscopy by other instruments. Later reprocessing of the images enabled the
recovery of 6 more candidates. Additionally, we implement our candidate
selection procedure on simulated kilonovae and supernovae under DECam observing
conditions (e.g., seeing, exposure time) with the intent of quantifying our
search efficiency and making informed decisions on observing strategy for
future similar events. This is the first BNS counterpart search to employ a
comprehensive simulation-based efficiency study. We find that using the current
follow-up strategy, there would need to be 19 events similar to S190510g for us
to have a 99\% chance of detecting an optical counterpart, assuming a
GW170817-like kilonova. We further conclude that optimization of observing
plans, which should include preference for deeper images over multiple color
information, could result in up to a factor of 1.5 reduction in the total
number of followups needed for discovery.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08727v1,"Adjusting Neutrino Interaction Models and Evaluating Uncertainties using
  NOvA Near Detector Data","  The two-detector design of the NOvA neutrino oscillation experiment, in which
two functionally identical detectors are exposed to an intense neutrino beam,
aids in canceling leading order effects of cross-section uncertainties.
However, limited knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections still gives
rise to some of the largest systematic uncertainties in current oscillation
measurements. We show contemporary models of neutrino interactions to be
discrepant with data from NOvA, consistent with discrepancies seen in other
experiments. Adjustments to neutrino interaction models in GENIE that improve
agreement with our data are presented. We also describe systematic
uncertainties on these models, including uncertainties on multi-nucleon
interactions from a newly developed procedure using NOvA near detector data.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04497v1,"Searching for long-lived particles beyond the Standard Model at the
  Large Hadron Collider","  Particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) can generically have lifetimes that
are long compared to SM particles at the weak scale. When produced at
experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, these long-lived
particles (LLPs) can decay far from the interaction vertex of the primary
proton-proton collision. Such LLP signatures are distinct from those of
promptly decaying particles that are targeted by the majority of searches for
new physics at the LHC, often requiring customized techniques to identify, for
example, significantly displaced decay vertices, tracks with atypical
properties, and short track segments. Given their non-standard nature, a
comprehensive overview of LLP signatures at the LHC is beneficial to ensure
that possible avenues of the discovery of new physics are not overlooked. Here
we report on the joint work of a community of theorists and experimentalists
with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments --- as well as those working on
dedicated experiments such as MoEDAL, milliQan, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and FASER
--- to survey the current state of LLP searches at the LHC, and to chart a path
for the development of LLP searches into the future, both in the upcoming Run 3
and at the High-Luminosity LHC. The work is organized around the current and
future potential capabilities of LHC experiments to generally discover new
LLPs, and takes a signature-based approach to surveying classes of models that
give rise to LLPs rather than emphasizing any particular theory motivation. We
develop a set of simplified models; assess the coverage of current searches;
document known, often unexpected backgrounds; explore the capabilities of
proposed detector upgrades; provide recommendations for the presentation of
search results; and look towards the newest frontiers, namely high-multiplicity
""dark showers"", highlighting opportunities for expanding the LHC reach for
these signals.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09421v1,Complete measurement of $Œõ$ electromagnetic form factors,"  The exclusive process $e^+e^-\rightarrow\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda
\to p\pi^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda} \to \bar{p}\pi^+$, has been studied at $\sqrt{s}
=$ 2.396 GeV for measurement of the $\Lambda$ electric and magnetic form
factors, $G_E$ and $G_M$. A data sample, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 66.9 pb$^{-1}$, was collected with the BESIII detector for this
purpose. A multi-dimensional analysis with a complete decomposition of the spin
structure of the reaction enables a determination of the modulus of the ratio
$R=|G_E/G_M|$ and, for the first time for any baryon, the relative phase
$\Delta\Phi=\Phi_E-\Phi_M$. The resulting values are obtained using the recent
and most precise measured value of the asymmetry parameter $\alpha_{\Lambda}$ =
$0.750~\pm~0.010$ to be $R~=~0.96\pm0.14~(\rm stat.)\pm~0.02~(\rm sys.)$ and
$\Delta\Phi=37^{\mathrm{o}}\pm~12^{\mathrm{o}}~(\rm
stat.)\pm~6^{\mathrm{o}}~(\rm sys.)$, respectively. In addition, the cross
section is measured with unprecedented precision to be $\sigma =
118.7~\pm~5.3~(\rm stat.)\pm~5.1~(\rm sys.)$ pb, which corresponds to an
effective form factor of $|G|=0.123~\pm~0.003~(\rm stat.)\pm~0.003~(\rm sys.)$.
The contribution from two-photon exchange is found to be negligible. Our result
enables the first complete determination of baryon time-like electromagnetic
form factors.
