http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3674v1,The Dynamic X-ray Sky of the Local Universe,"  Over the next decade, we can expect time domain astronomy to flourish at
optical and radio wavelengths. In parallel with these efforts, a dedicated
transient ""machine"" operating at higher energies (X-ray band through soft
gamma-rays) is required to reveal the unique subset of events with variable
emission predominantly visible above 100 eV. Here we focus on the transient
phase space never yet sampled due to the lack of a sensitive, wide-field and
triggering facility dedicated exclusively to catching high energy transients
and enabling rapid coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. We first describe
the advancements in our understanding of known X-ray transients that can only
be enabled through such a facility and then focus on the classes of transients
theoretically predicted to be out of reach of current detection capabilities.
Finally there is the exciting opportunity of revealing new classes of X-ray
transients and unveiling their nature through coordinated follow-up
observations at longer wavelengths.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0293v2,The Effective Field Theory of Inflation,"  We study the effective field theory of inflation, i.e. the most general
theory describing the fluctuations around a quasi de Sitter background, in the
case of single field models. The scalar mode can be eaten by the metric by
going to unitary gauge. In this gauge, the most general theory is built with
the lowest dimension operators invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms, like
g^{00} and K_{mu nu}, the extrinsic curvature of constant time surfaces. This
approach allows us to characterize all the possible high energy corrections to
simple slow-roll inflation, whose sizes are constrained by experiments. Also,
it describes in a common language all single field models, including those with
a small speed of sound and Ghost Inflation, and it makes explicit the
implications of having a quasi de Sitter background. The non-linear realization
of time diffeomorphisms forces correlation among different observables, like a
reduced speed of sound and an enhanced level of non-Gaussianity.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3482v1,Code injection attacks on harvard-architecture devices,"  Harvard architecture CPU design is common in the embedded world. Examples of
Harvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors.
Mica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets.
Stack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and then
execute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that code
injection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remote
code injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit program
vulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memory
of an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result that
presents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work only
succeeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injecting
permanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of the
target sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm that
can propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensor
botnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return oriented
programming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details and
suggest some counter-measures.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0248v1,The merger-driven evolution of warm infrared luminous galaxies,"  We present a merger-driven evolutionary model for the production of luminous
(LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with warm IR colours. Our
results show that simulations of gas--rich major mergers including star
formation, black hole growth, and feedback can produce warm (U)LIRGs. We also
find that while the warm evolutionary phase is associated with increased AGN
activity, star formation alone may be sufficient to produce warm IR colours.
However, the transition can be suppressed entirely - even when there is a
significant AGN contribution - when we assume a single-phase ISM, which
maximizes the attenuation. Finally, our evolutionary models are consistent with
the 25-to-60 micron flux density ratio vs. L_HX/L_IR relation for local LIRGs
and ULIRGs, and predict the observed scatter in IR color at fixed L_HX/L_IR.
Therefore, our models suggest a cautionary note in the interpretation of warm
IR colours: while associated with periods of active black hole growth, they are
probably produced by a complex mix of star formation and AGN activity
intermediate between the cold star formation dominated phase and the birth of a
bright, unobscured quasar.

  Using 13CO and C18O Observations of IC348","  3D Slicer, a brain imaging and visualization computer application developed
at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Surgical Planning Lab, was used to visualize
the IC 348 star-forming complex in Perseus in RA-DEC-Velocity space. This
project is part of a collaboration between Harvard University's Astronomy
Department and Medical School, and serves as a proof-of-concept technology
demonstration for Harvard's Institute for Innovative Computing (IIC). 3D Slicer
is capable of displaying volumes (data cubes), slices in any direction through
the volume, 3D models generated from the volume, and 3D models of label maps.
The 3D spectral line maps of IC 348 were created using 13CO and C18O data
collected at the FCRAO (Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory). The 3D
visualization makes the identification of the cloud's inner dense cores and
velocity structure components easier than current conventional astronomical
methods. It is planned for 3D Slicer to be enhanced with astrophysics-specific
features resulting in an astronomical version to be available online through
the IIC and in conjunction with the National Virtual Observatory (NVO).

http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4265v1,"The Binarity of the Magellanic Clouds and the Formation of the
  Magellanic Stream","  The HST proper motion (PM) measurements of the Clouds have severe
implications for their interaction history with the Milky Way (MW) and with
each other. The Clouds are likely on their first passage about the MW and the
SMC's orbit about the LMC is better described as quasi-periodic rather than
circular. Binary L/SMC orbits that satisfy observational constraints on their
mutual interaction history (e.g. the formation of the Magellanic Bridge during
a collision between the Clouds ~300 Myr ago) can be located within 1 sigma of
the mean PMs. However, these binary orbits are not co-located with the
Magellanic Stream (MS) when projected on the plane of the sky and the
line-of-sight velocity gradient along the LMC's orbit is significantly steeper
than that along the MS. These combined results ultimately rule out a purely
tidal origin for the MS: tides are ineffective without multiple pericentric
passages and can neither decrease the velocity gradient nor explain the offset
stream in a polar orbit configuration. Alternatively, ram pressure stripping of
an extended gaseous disk may naturally explain the deviation. The offset also
suggests that observations of the little-explored region between RA 21h and 23h
are crucial for characterizing the full extent of the MS.

  Galaxies at z~2","  We present millimetre observations of a sample of 12 high redshift
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) in the Extended Growth Strip (EGS).
These objects were initially selected on the basis of their observed mid--IR
colours (0.0 < [3.6]-[4.5] < 0.4 and -0.7 < [3.6]-[8.0] < 0.5) to lie at high
redshift 1.5 < z < 3, and subsequent 20-38 micron mid-IR spectroscopy confirms
that they lie in a narrow redshift window centered on z=2. We detect 9/12 of
the objects in our sample at high significance (>3 sigma) with a mean
1200\micron flux of <F_1200> = 1.6+/-0.1 mJy. Our millimetre photometry,
combined with existing far-IR photometry from the Far-IR Deep Extragalactic
Legacy (FIDEL) Survey and accurate spectroscopic redshifts, places constraints
both sides of the thermal dust peak. This allows us to estimate the dust
properties, including the far--IR luminosity, dust temperature, and dust mass.
We find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ULIRGs,
and local systems, but has a different dust selection function than
submillimeter-selected galaxies. Finally, we use existing 20cm radio continuum
imaging to test the far-IR/radio correlation at high redshift. We find that our
sample is consistent with the local relation, implying little evolution.
Furthermore, this suggests that our sample selection method is efficient at
identifying ultraluminous, starburst--dominated systems within a very narrow
redshift range centered at z~2.

region of a disk, which we model as a linear shear flow with Coriolis force,
between two parallel walls. Although there are no exponentially growing
eigenmodes in this system, because of the non-normal nature of the modes, it is
possible to have a large transient growth in the energy of certain
perturbations. For a constant angular momentum disk, the energy grows by more
than a factor of 1000 for a Reynolds number of only 1000, and so turbulence is
easily excited. For a Keplerian disk, the growth is more modest, and energy
growth by a factor of 1000 requires a Reynolds number of nearly a million.
Accretion disks have even larger Reynolds numbers than this. Therefore,
transient growth of perturbations could seed turbulence in such disks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2662v1,On the stabilization of ion sputtered surfaces,"  The classical theory of ion beam sputtering predicts the instability of a
flat surface to uniform ion irradiation at any incidence angle. We relax the
assumption of the classical theory that the average surface erosion rate is
determined by a Gaussian response function representing the effect of the
collision cascade and consider the surface dynamics for other
physically-motivated response functions. We show that although instability of
flat surfaces at any beam angle results from all Gaussian and a wide class of
non-Gaussian erosive response functions, there exist classes of modifications
to the response that can have a dramatic effect. In contrast to the classical
theory, these types of response render the flat surface linearly stable, while
imperceptibly modifying the predicted sputter yield vs. incidence angle. We
discuss the possibility that such corrections underlie recent reports of a
``window of stability'' of ion-bombarded surfaces at a range of beam angles for
certain ion and surface types, and describe some characteristic aspects of
pattern evolution near the transition from unstable to stable dynamics. We
point out that careful analysis of the transition regime may provide valuable

surfaces.

  SNR G1.9+0.3","  Type Ia supernovae, with their remarkably homogeneous light curves and
spectra, have been used as standardizable candles to measure the accelerating
expansion of the Universe. Yet, their progenitors remain elusive. Common
explanations invoke a degenerate star (white dwarf) which explodes upon
reaching close to the Chandrasekhar limit, by either steadily accreting mass
from a companion star or violently merging with another degenerate star. We
show that circumstellar interaction in young Galactic supernova remnants can be
used to distinguish between these single and double degenerate progenitor
scenarios. Here we propose a new diagnostic, the Surface Brightness Index,
which can be computed from theory and compared with Chandra and VLA
observations. We use this method to demonstrate that a double degenerate
progenitor can explain the decades-long flux rise and size increase of the
youngest known Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3. We disfavor a single degenerate scenario.
We attribute the observed properties to the interaction between a steep ejecta
profile and a constant density environment. We suggest using the upgraded VLA
to detect circumstellar interaction in the remnants of historical Type Ia
supernovae in the Local Group of galaxies. This may settle the long-standing
debate over their progenitors.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2399v2,(No) Eternal Inflation and Precision Higgs Physics,"  Even if nothing but a light Higgs is observed at the LHC, suggesting that the
Standard Model is unmodified up to scales far above the weak scale, Higgs
physics can yield surprises of fundamental significance for cosmology. As has
long been known, the Standard Model vacuum may be metastable for low enough
Higgs mass, but a specific value of the decay rate holds special significance:
for a very narrow window of parameters, our Universe has not yet decayed but
the current inflationary period can not be future eternal. Determining whether
we are in this window requires exquisite but achievable experimental precision,
with a measurement of the Higgs mass to 0.1 GeV at the LHC, the top mass to 60
MeV at a linear collider, as well as an improved determination of alpha_s by an
order of magnitude on the lattice. If the parameters are observed to lie in
this special range, particle physics will establish that the future of our
Universe is a global big crunch, without harboring pockets of eternal
inflation, strongly suggesting that eternal inflation is censored by the
fundamental theory. This conclusion could be drawn even more sharply if
metastability with the appropriate decay rate is found in the MSSM, where the
physics governing the instability can be directly probed at the TeV scale.

  ultraluminous X-ray sources","  Based on our long (~ 300 ks) 2007 XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert
galaxy NGC 1365, we report here on the spectral and timing behaviour of two
ultraluminous X-ray sources, which had previously reached isotropic X-ray
luminosities L_X ~ 4 x 10^{40} erg/s (0.3-10 keV band). In 2007, they were in a
lower state (L_X ~ 5 x 10^{39} erg/s, and L_X ~ 1.5 x 10^{39} erg/s for X1 and
X2, respectively). Their X-ray spectra were dominated by power-laws with photon
indices Gamma ~ 1.8 and Gamma ~ 1.2, respectively. Thus, their spectra were
similar to those at their outburst peaks. Both sources have been seen to vary
by a factor of 20 in luminosity over the years, but their spectra are always
dominated by a hard power-law; unlike most stellar-mass BHs, they have never
been found in a canonical high/soft state dominated by a standard disk. The
lack of a canonical high/soft state seems to be a common feature of ULXs. We
speculate that the different kind of donor star and/or a persistently
super-Eddington accretion rate during their outbursts may prevent accretion
flows in ULXs from settling into steady standard disks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3020v2,The Kennicutt-Schmidt Star Formation Relation at z~2,"  Recent observations of excited CO emission lines from z~2 disc galaxies have
shed light on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at high-z via observed SFR-CO
(J=2-1) and (J=3-2) relations. Here, we describe a novel methodology for
utilising these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying
Schmidt (SFR-rho^N) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the
potential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily
star-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO
states than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-CO^alpha
index, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N.
Utilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line
radiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2
disc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed
SFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in
relatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,
resulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines. This means that an observed
(e.g.) SFR-CO (J=3-2) relation does not map linearly to SFR-H2 relation. We
utilise our model results to provide a mapping from alpha to N for the range of
Schmidt indices N=1-2. By comparing to recent observational surveys, we find
that the observed SFR-CO (J=2-1) and SFR-CO (J=3-2) relations suggest that an
underlying SFR rho^1.5 relation describes z~2 disc galaxies.

level, heralding a new era for discerning the kinematic and spatial coordinates
of stars in our Galaxy. Here, we present a new technique for estimating the age
of tidally disrupted globular cluster streams using the proper motions and
parallaxes of tracer stars. We evolve the collisional dynamics of globular
clusters within the evolving potential of a Milky Way-like halo extracted from
a cosmological $\Lambda$CDM simulation and analyze the resultant streams as
they would be observed by Gaia. The simulations sample a variety of globular
cluster orbits, and account for stellar evolution and the gravitational
influence of the disk of the Milky Way. We show that a characteristic
timescale, obtained from the dispersion of the proper motions and parallaxes of
stars within the stream, is a good indicator for the time elapsed since the
stream has been freely expanding away due to the tidal disruption of the
globular cluster. This timescale, in turn, places a lower limit on the age of
the cluster. The age can be deduced from astrometry using a modest number of
stars, with the error on this estimate depending on the proximity of the stream
and the number of tracer stars used.

  Implications for the Magnetic Field Topology","  We present multi-epoch radio and optical observations of the M7 dwarf 2MASS
J13142039+1320011. We detect a ~1 mJy source at 1.43, 4.86, 8.46 and 22.5 GHz,
making it the most luminous radio emission over the widest frequency range
detected from an ultracool dwarf to date. A 10 hr VLA observation reveals that
the radio emission varies sinusoidally with a period of 3.89+/-0.05 hr, and an
amplitude of ~30% at 4.86 GHz and ~20% at 8.46 GHz. The periodicity is also
seen in circular polarization, where at 4.86 GHz the polarization reverses
helicity from left- to right-handed in phase with the total intensity. An
archival detection in the FIRST survey indicates that the radio emission has
been stable for at least a decade. We also detect periodic photometric
variability in several optical filters with a period of 3.79 hr, and measure a
rotation velocity of vsini=45+/-5 km/s, in good agreement with the radio and
optical periods. The period and rotation velocity allow us to place a lower
limit on the radius of the source of >0.12 R_sun, about 30% larger than
theoretical expectations. The properties of the radio emission can be explained
with a simple model of a magnetic dipole mis-aligned relative to the stellar
rotation axis, with the sinusoidal variations and helicity reversal due to the
rotation of the magnetic poles relative to our line of sight. The long-term
stability of the radio emission indicates that the magnetic field (and hence
the dynamo) is stable on a much longer timescale than the convective turn-over
time of ~0.2 yr. If the radio emission is due to the electron cyclotron maser
process, the inferred magnetic field strength reaches at least 8 kG.

heuristic approximate expressions for the radial profiles are also presented.

condense into neutrino nuggets which redshift away similar to cold dark matter,
and thus cease to act as dark energy. Any stable MaVaNs dark energy model is
extremely contrived, and is virtually indistinguishable from a cosmological

systems so as to implement the corresponding parser. The method generalizes
easily to parsers for augmented phrase structure formalisms, such as
definite-clause grammars and other logic grammar formalisms, and has been used
for rapid prototyping of parsing algorithms for a variety of formalisms
including variants of tree-adjoining grammars, categorial grammars, and
lexicalized context-free grammars.

the laborious nature of making measurements one molecule at a time. We have
solved these issues with a new approach: massively parallel single-molecule

novel instrument that we call the Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), in which
objects in an orbiting sample are subjected to a calibration-free,

observed. We demonstrate high-throughput single-molecule force spectroscopy
with this technique by performing thousands of rupture experiments in parallel,
characterizing force-dependent unbinding kinetics of an antibody-antigen pair

There are ~29,000 unique objects with light curves in either or both IRAC
channels in the YSOVAR data set. We present the data collection and reduction
for the Spitzer and ancillary data, and define the ""standard sample"" on which
we calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs about
twice per day for ~40d. We also define a ""standard sample of members"",
consisting of all the IR-selected members and X-ray selected members. We
characterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectral
energy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the
fast cadence data--the Stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, and
significant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales
possible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer
mission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in each
cluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of the
ratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with a
higher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-term
variables. For objects with a YSOVAR-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color,
we find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorter
periods to have an IR excess. We do not find any evidence for variability that
causes [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of members
and field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient IR excesses.

act, is of great public health interest. Growing evidence supports an
association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and epigenetic marks,
such as DNA methylation, but the timing and gene-specific effects of these
epigenetic changes are not well understood. Here, we present the first study
that aims to identify prenatal windows of susceptibility to air pollution
exposures in cord blood DNA methylation. In particular, we propose a
function-on-function regression model that leverages data from nearby DNA
methylation probes to identify epigenetic regions that exhibit windows of
susceptibility to ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 microns
(PM$_{2.5}$). By incorporating the covariance structure among both the
multivariate DNA methylation outcome and the time-varying exposure under study,
this framework yields greater power to detect windows of susceptibility and
greater control of false discoveries than methods that model probes
independently. We compare our method to a distributed lag model approach that
models DNA methylation in a probe-by-probe manner, both in simulation and by
application to motivating data from the Project Viva birth cohort. In two
epigenetic regions selected based on prior studies of air pollution effects on
epigenome-wide methylation, we identify windows of susceptibility to PM$_{2.5}$

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5425v2,The impact of feedback on cosmological gas accretion,"  We investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time in
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations is modified by a comprehensive physical
model for baryonic feedback processes. To do so, we compare two simulations --
with and without feedback -- both evolved with the moving mesh code AREPO. The
feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation
project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback
from supermassive blackholes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material
contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the
intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as
well as the net, inflow of this ""smooth mode"" gas at all redshifts, regardless
of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the
temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z=2.
However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir
decreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the rates
of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this
boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total
accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of
two across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold
temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z<1. (d) The
amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy --
the ""halo transit time"" -- increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of
~2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible
implications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01614v1,"Efficacy of early stellar feedback in low gas surface density
  environments","  We present a suite of high resolution radiation hydrodynamic simulations of a
small patch ($1 \ {\rm kpc}^2$) of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) performed
with Arepo-RT, with the aim to quantify the efficacy of various feedback
processes like supernovae explosions (SNe), photoheating and radiation pressure
in low gas surface density galaxies ($\Sigma_{\rm gas} \simeq 10 \ {\rm
M}_\odot \ {\rm pc}^{-2}$). We show that radiation fields decrease the star
formation rate and therefore the total stellar mass formed by a factor of $\sim
2$. This increases the gas depletion timescale and brings the simulated
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation closer to the observational estimates. Radiation
feedback coupled with SNe is more efficient at driving outflows with the mass
and energy loading increasing by a factor of $\sim 10$. This increase is mainly
driven by the additional entrainment of medium density ($10^{-2} \leq n< 1 \
{\rm cm}^{-3}$), warm ($300 \ {\rm K}\leq T<8000 \ {\rm K}$) material.
Therefore including radiation fields tends to launch colder, denser and higher
mass and energy loaded outflows. This is because photoheating of the high
density gas around a newly formed star over-pressurises the region, causing it
to expand. This reduces the ambient density in which the SNe explode by a
factor of $10-100$ which in turn increases their momentum output by a factor of
$\sim 1.5-2.5$. Finally, we note that in these low gas surface density
environments, radiation fields primarily impact the ISM via photoheating and
radiation pressure has only a minimal role in regulating star formation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06167v3,Simulating the effect of photoheating feedback during reionization,"  We present self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic simulations of hydrogen
reionization performed with Arepo-RT complemented by a state-of-the-art galaxy
formation model. We examine how photoheating feedback, due to reionization,
shapes the galaxies properties. Our fiducial model completes reionization by
$z\approx6$ and matches observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the CMB electron
scattering optical depth, the high-redshift UV luminosity function, and stellar
mass function. Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star
formation rates by more than $50\%$ only in halos less massive than
$\sim10^{8.4}\ M_\odot$ ($\sim10^{8.8}\ M_\odot$) at $z=6$ $(z=5)$, suggesting
inefficient photoheating feedback from photons within galaxies. The use of a
uniform UV background that heats up the gas at $z\approx10.7$ generates an
earlier onset of suppression of star formation compared to our fiducial model.
This discrepancy can be mitigated by adopting a UV background model with a more
realistic reionization history. In the absence of stellar feedback,
photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than $\sim10^9\
M_\odot$ at $z\gtrsim5$, implying that photoheating feedback is sub-dominant in
regulating star formation. In addition, stellar feedback, implemented as a
non-local galactic wind scheme in the simulations, weakens the strength of

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05379v1,Tuning the Exo-Space Weather Radio for Stellar Coronal Mass Ejections,"  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on stars other than the Sun have proven very
difficult to detect. One promising pathway lies in the detection of type II
radio bursts. Their appearance and distinctive properties are associated with
the development of an outward propagating CME-driven shock. However, dedicated
radio searches have not been able to identify these transient features in other
stars. Large Alfv\'en speeds and the magnetic suppression of CMEs in active
stars have been proposed to render stellar eruptions ""radio-quiet"". Employing
3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study here the distribution of the
coronal Alfv\'en speed, focusing on two cases representative of a young
Sun-like star and a mid-activity M-dwarf (Proxima Centauri). These results are
compared with a standard solar simulation and used to characterize the
shock-prone regions in the stellar corona and wind. Furthermore, using a
flux-rope eruption model, we drive realistic CME events within our M-dwarf
simulation. We consider eruptions with different energies to probe the regimes
of weak and partial CME magnetic confinement. While these CMEs are able to
generate shocks in the corona, those are pushed much farther out compared to
their solar counterparts. This drastically reduces the resulting type II radio
burst frequencies down to the ionospheric cutoff, which impedes their detection
with ground-based instrumentation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0112040v1,Kinetic energy density functionals for non-periodic systems,"  Kinetic energy functionals of the electronic density are used to model large
systems in the context of density functional theory, without the need to obtain
electronic wavefunctions. We discuss the problems associated with the
application of widely used kinetic energy functionals to non-periodic systems.
We develop a method that circumvents this difficulty and allows the kinetic
energy to be evaluated entirely in real space. We demonstrate that the method
is efficient [O(N)] and accurate by comparing the results of our real-space
formulation to calculations performed in reciprocal space, and to calculations
using traditional approaches based on electronic states.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2280v2,"The Most Luminous z~9-10 Galaxy Candidates yet Found: The Luminosity
  Function, Cosmic Star-Formation Rate, and the First Mass Density Estimate at
  500 Myr","  [abridged] We present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (H_160 ~ 26 -
27 mag AB) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete HST CANDELS WFC3/IR
GOODS-N imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that are
known, just ~500 Myr after the Big Bang. Two similarly bright sources are also
detected in a systematic re-analysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four
galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deep
Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore,
the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at
3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a
slope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at
high redshift. The abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that the
luminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in L_* at z>~8
with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.
Despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formation
rate density for galaxies with SFR >0.7 M_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitude
increase in only 170 Myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previous
results. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,
finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 M_sun. The cosmic
stellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 M_sun Mpc^-3 for
galaxies brighter than M_UV~-18. The remarkable brightness, and hence
luminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deep
spectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value of
additional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation in
the very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for JWST to map the
buildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

1996. The source was observed in various spectral states; the highest
luminosity state (LX ~ 1.5 10^37 ergs/s, 10 kpc, 1-20 keV) is associated with a
soft spectrum, whereas for the lower luminosity state (down to ~5 10^36 ergs/s)
the spectrum is significantly harder. Using the high time resolution data
provided by the Proportional Counter Array (PCA), we have discovered
High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) in the persistent X-ray
emission of 4U1915-05 while its luminosity was ~8 10^36 ergs/s. The QPO
frequency ranges from 600 Hz up to ~1000 Hz, with typical Full Width at Half
Maximum (FWHM) ~50-100 Hz and Root Mean Squared (RMS) values 15%. In addition,
by using the ``shift and add'' technique, we have detected a twin HFQPO (5.5
sigma level) separated from the main peak by ~355 Hz. 4U1915-05 is the eighth
Atoll source displaying simultaneous twin HFQPOs. Based on current knowledge of

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102232v1,Structure of Sagittarius A* at 86 GHz using VLBI Closure Quantities,"  At radio wavelengths, images of the compact radio source Sagittarius A* (Sgr
A*) in the Galactic Center are scatter broadened with a lambda^2 dependence due
to an intervening ionized medium. We present VLBI observations of Sgr A* at 86
GHz using a six station array including the VLBA antennas at Pie Town, Fort
Davis and Los Alamos, the 12m antenna at Kitt Peak and the millimeter arrays at
Hat Creek and Owens Valley. To avoid systematic errors due to imperfect antenna
calibration, the data were modeled using interferometric closure information.
The data are best modeled by a circular Gaussian brightness distribution of
FWHM 0.18 +- 0.02 mas. The data are also shown to be consistent with an
elliptical model corresponding to the scattering of a point source. The source
structure in the N-S direction, which is less well determined than in the E-W
direction due to the limited N-S (u,v) coverage of the array, is constrained to
be less than 0.27 mas by these measurements. These results are consistent with
extrapolations of intrinsic structure estimates obtained with VLBI at 7mm
wavelength assuming the intrinsic size of Sgr A* has a greater dependence than
lambda^0.9 with wavelength.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405266v2,Direct Detection of Dark Matter with Space-based Laser Interferometers,"  Dark matter pervades the Solar System, free-streaming at the halo's local
Galactic orbital velocity and density. As these objects pass through the Solar
system, they perturb gravitationally, and thus very weakly, all nearby inertial
masses. Making use of this, we propose an approach to the direct detection of
dark matter at previously inaccessible intermediate masses (1e14 -- 1e20 gm).
Such mass scales are relevant for example for dark matter made of primordial
black holes or clumped matter in a sequestered sector. If such dark matter
exists it will be unambiguously detectable through its inelastic gravitational
interaction with the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
experiment. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by studying the dark
matter signal in numerical simulations of the LISA data stream. A more
conservative approach -- to detect dark matter in the differential acceleration
power spectrum -- significantly underestimates the expected rates for LISA.
Interestingly, while the space-density of 1e15 gm DM objects would be
comparable to the space-density of asteroids of similar masses, such ``light
matter'' contaminants are readily detectable in reflected Solar light, allowing
for the elimination of the major background.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507524v2,Characteristic Scales During Reionization,"  One of the key observables of the reionization era is the distribution of
neutral and ionized gas. Recently, Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, & Hernquist
developed a simple analytic model to describe the growth of HII regions during
this era. Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions
behind this model and generalise it in several important ways. The model
predicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size R_c
that ranges from R_c~1 Mpc in the early phases to R_c>10 Mpc in the late
phases. We show that R_c is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies
driving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental
property of the first galaxies. The variance around R_c, on the other hand, is
determined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that
increasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts R_c to
significantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations.
These differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21 cm surveys
(increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of two on
large scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background. Finally, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the
galaxy population only broaden the bubble size distribution significantly if
massive galaxies are responsible for most of the ionizing photons. We argue
that the key results of this model are robust to many of our uncertainties
about the reionization process.

interatomic forces in bulk silicon. The theoretical results underlying the
model include a novel analysis of elastic properties for the diamond and
graphitic structures and inversions of ab initio cohesive energy curves. The
interaction model includes two-body and three-body terms which depend on the
local atomic environment through an effective coordination number. This
formulation is able to capture successfully: (i) the energetics and elastic
properties of the ground state diamond lattice; (ii) the covalent
re-hybridization of undercoordinated atoms; (iii) and a smooth transition to
metallic bonding for overcoordinated atoms. Because the essential features of
chemical bonding in the bulk are built into the functional form, this model
promises to be useful for describing interatomic forces in silicon bulk phases
and defects. Although this functional form is remarkably realistic by usual
standards, it contains a small number of fitting parameters and requires
computational effort comparable to the most efficient existing models. In a
companion paper, a complete parameterization of the model is given, and
excellent performance for condensed phases and bulk defects is demonstrated.

one-dimensional (1d) periodic potential as, for example, realized in recent
experiments on 2d colloids subjected to two interfering laser beams. The
topology of the phase diagram is found to depend primarily on two factors: the
relative orientation of the 2d crystal and the periodic potential troughs,
which select a set of Bragg planes running parallel to the troughs, and the
commensurability ratio p= a'/d of the spacing a' between these Bragg planes to
the period d of the periodic potential. The complexity of the phase diagram
increases with the magnitude of the commensurabilty ratio p. Rich phase
diagram, with ``modulated liquid'', ``floating'' and ``locked floating'' solid
and smectic phases are found. Phase transitions between these phases fall into
two broad universality classes, roughening and melting, driven by the
proliferation of discommensuration walls and dislocations, respectively. We
discuss correlation functions and the static structure factor in these phases
and make detailed predictions of the universal features close to the phase
boundaries. We predict that for charged systems with highly screened
short-range interactions these melting transitions are generically reentrant as
a function of the strength of the periodic potential, prediction that is in
accord with recent 2d colloid experiments. Implications of our results for
future experiments are also discussed.

and complex dynamics for which a general theoretical framework based on finite
populations is still lacking. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in
the form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent
selection with two strategies in finite populations based on microscopic
processes [A.Traulsen, J.C. Claussen, and C.Hauert, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 238701
(2005)]. Here we generalize this approach in a twofold way: First, we extend
the framework to an arbitrary number of strategies and second, we allow for
mutations in the evolutionary process. The deterministic limit of infinite
population size of the frequency dependent Moran process yields the adjusted
replicator-mutator equation, which describes the combined effect of selection
and mutation. For finite populations, we provide an extension taking random
drift into account. In the limit of neutral selection, i.e. whenever the
process is determined by random drift and mutations, the stationary strategy
distribution is derived. This distribution forms the background for the
coevolutionary process. In particular, a critical mutation rate $u_c$ is
obtained separating two scenarios: above $u_c$ the population predominantly
consists of a mixture of strategies whereas below $u_c$ the population tends to
be in homogenous states. For one of the fundamental problems in evolutionary
biology, the evolution of cooperation under Darwinian selection, we demonstrate
that the analytical framework provides excellent approximations to individual
based simulations even for rather small population sizes. This approach
complements simulation results and provides a deeper, systematic understanding
of coevolutionary dynamics.

generated by systems fulfilling two requirements: i) a ``small-world'' topology
and ii) the presence of noise. Our findings support two notable conclusions:
first, complex physiologic-like signals can be modeled with a minimal set of
components; and second, systems fulfilling conditions (i) and (ii) are robust
to some degree of degradation, i.e., they will still be able to generate

method of identifying strong lens systems in large data sets. We study the
probabilities associated with these lens searches, namely the probability of
identifying a candidate with rogue [OII] emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum,
and the probability that the candidate will show features of strong lensing in
follow-up photometric observations. We include selection effects unique to
spectroscopic data, and apply them to the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey (Bolton
et al. 2006). The most significant selection effect is the finite size of the
spectroscopic fiber which selects against large separation lenses and results
in a non-monotonic dependence of the rogue line probability on velocity
dispersion. For example, with the 3 arcsec diameter SDSS fiber and 2 arcsec
FWHM seeing, we find that the probability that a given LRG has a rogue [OII]
line in its spectrum decreases with velocity dispersion from 150 km/s to 300
km/s and then increases up to 400 km/s for a given source size. The total
probability for observing a rogue line in a single survey spectrum is
~0.9-3.0%, and the total lensing rate is ~0.5-1.3%. The range is due to
uncertainties in the physical size of [OII] emission regions, and in the
evolution of the [OII] luminosity function. Our estimates are a factor of ~5
higher than the results of the SLACS survey, a discrepancy which we attribute
to the SLACS requirement that multiple rogue lines be observed simultaneously.

comparing templates of Galactic dust and Halpha with the 5-year maps from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. The Halpha-correlated microwave emission
deviates from the thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free) spectrum expected for
ionized gas, exhibiting an additional broad bump peaked at ~40 GHz which
provides ~20% of the peak intensity. We confirm that the bump is consistent
with a modified Draine & Lazarian (1998) spinning dust model, though the peak
frequency of the emission is somewhat lower than the 50 GHz previously claimed.
This frequency shift results from systematic errors in the large-scale modes of
the 3-year WMAP data which have been corrected in the 5-year data release. We
show that the bump is not the result of errors in the Halpha template by
analyzing regions of high free-free intensity, where the WMAP K-band map may be
used as the free-free template. We rule out a pure free-free spectrum for the
Halpha-correlated emission at high confidence: ~27sigma for the nearly full-sky
fit, even after marginalizing over the CMB cross-correlation bias. We also
extend the previous analysis by searching the parameter space of the Draine &
Lazarian model but letting the amplitude float. The best fit for reasonable
values of the characteristic electric dipole moment and density requires an
amplitude factor of ~0.3. This suggests that small PAHs in the warm ionized

identified as a probable recurrent nova based on its large expansion velocities
and the presence of high excitation lines in the outburst spectrum. The event
was recorded on Harvard plate AM 505, at a B magnitude of 10.27 +/- 0.11, which
is near peak. The outburst can only be seen on one plate, but the image has a

conclude that this is in fact a previously-undiscovered nova outburst of V2487

discovery efficiency for eruptions of the system and conclude that a
randomly-timed outburst has, on average, a 30% chance of being discovered in

http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0518v1,Observing Supernova 1987A with the Refurbished Hubble Space Telescope,"  Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), conducted since 1990, now
offer an unprecedented glimpse into fast astrophysical shocks in the young
remnant of supernova 1987A. Comparing observations taken in 2010 using the
refurbished instruments on HST with data taken in 2004, just before the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph failed, we find that the Ly-a and H-a lines from
shock emission continue to brighten, while their maximum velocities continue to
decrease. We observe broad blueshifted Ly-a, which we attribute to resonant
scattering of photons emitted from hotspots on the equatorial ring. We also
detect NV~\lambda\lambda 1239,1243 A line emission, but only to the red of
Ly-A. The profiles of the NV lines differ markedly from that of H-a, suggesting
that the N^{4+} ions are scattered and accelerated by turbulent electromagnetic
fields that isotropize the ions in the collisionless shock.

  J13153094-2649513AB","  We report the detection of radio emission from the unusually active L5e + T7
binary 2MASS J13153094-2649513AB made with the Australian Telescope Compact
Array. Observations at 5.5 GHz reveal an unresolved source with a continuum
flux of 370+/-50 microJy, corresponding to a radio luminosity of L_rad = nuL_nu
= (9+/-3)x10^23 erg/s and log10(L_rad/L_bol) = -5.44+/-0.22. No detection is
made at 9.0 GHz to a 5 sigma limit of 290 microJy, consistent with a power law
spectrum S_nu ~ nu^-a with a > 0.5. The emission is quiescent, with no evidence
of variability or bursts over 3 hr of observation, and no measurable
polarization (V/I < 34%). 2MASS J1315-2649AB is one of the most radio-luminous
ultracool dwarfs detected in quiescent emission to date, comparable in strength
to other cool sources detected in outburst. Its detection indicates no decline
in radio flux through the mid-L dwarfs. It is unique among L dwarfs in having
strong and persistent Halpha and radio emission, indicating the coexistence of
a cool, neutral photosphere (low electron density) and a highly active
chromosphere (high electron density and active heating). These traits, coupled
with the system's mature age and substellar secondary, makes 2MASS J1315-2649AB
an important test for proposed radio emission mechanisms in ultracool dwarfs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1179v1,DASCH 100-yr light curves of high-mass X-ray binaries,"  We analyzed the 100-yr light curves of Galactic high-mass X-ray binaries
using the Harvard photographic plate collection, made accessible through the
DASCH project (Digital Access to a Sky Century at Harvard). As scanning is
still in progress, we focus on the four objects that are currently well
covered: the supergiant X-ray binary Cyg X-1 (V1357 Cyg), and the Be X-ray
binaries 1H 1936+541 (BD+53 2262), RX J1744.7-2713 (HD 161103), and RX
J2030.5+4751 (SAO 49725), the latter two objects being similar to gamma Cas.
The star associated with Cyg X-1 does not show evidence for variability with an
amplitude higher than 0.3 magnitude over a hundred years. We found significant
variability of one magnitude with timescales of more than 10 years for SAO
49725, as well as a possible period of 500-600 days and an amplitude of 0.05
magnitude that might be the orbital, or super-orbital period of the system. The
data is insufficient to conclude for HD 161103 but suggests a similar long-term
variability. We thus observe an additional characteristic of gamma Cas-like
objects: their long-term variability. This variability seems to be due to the
slow evolution of a decretion disk around the Be star, but may be triggered by
the presence of a compact object in the system, possibly a white dwarf. This
characteristic could be used to identify further similar objects otherwise
difficult to detect.

  Meshes","  Magnetic fields play an important role in many astrophysical systems and a
detailed understanding of their impact on the gas dynamics requires robust
numerical simulations. Here we present a new method to evolve the ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations on unstructured static and moving meshes
that preserves the magnetic field divergence-free constraint to machine
precision. The method overcomes the major problems of using a cleaning scheme
on the magnetic fields instead, which is non-conservative, not fully Galilean
invariant, does not eliminate divergence errors completely, and may produce
incorrect jumps across shocks. Our new method is a generalization of the
constrained transport (CT) algorithm used to enforce the $\nabla\cdot
\mathbf{B}=0$ condition on fixed Cartesian grids. Preserving $\nabla\cdot
\mathbf{B}=0$ at the discretized level is necessary to maintain the
orthogonality between the Lorentz force and $\mathbf{B}$. The possibility of
performing CT on a moving mesh provides several advantages over static mesh
methods due to the quasi-Lagrangian nature of the former (i.e., the mesh
generating points move with the flow), such as making the simulation
automatically adaptive and significantly reducing advection errors. Our method
preserves magnetic fields and fluid quantities in pure advection exactly.

  in the Nigeria PEPFAR Program","  Since the early 2000s, evidence has accumulated for a significant
differential effect of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens on
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load suppression. This finding was
replicated in our data from the Harvard President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR) program in Nigeria. Investigators were interested in finding
the source of these differences, i.e., understanding the mechanisms through
which one regimen outperforms another, particularly via adherence. This
question can be naturally formulated via mediation analysis with adherence
playing the role of a mediator. Existing mediation analysis results, however,
have relied on an assumption of no exposure-induced confounding of the
intermediate variable, and generally require an assumption of no unmeasured
confounding for nonparametric identification. Both assumptions are violated by
the presence of drug toxicity. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and
show that certain path-specific effects remain identified under weaker
conditions. We focus on the path-specific effect solely mediated by adherence
and not by toxicity and propose an estimator for this effect. We illustrate
with simulations and present results from a study applying the methodology to
the Harvard PEPFAR data. Supplementary materials are available online.

the FU Ori nature of 2MASS J06593158-0405277, we have reconstructed its
photometric history by measuring its brightness on Harvard photographic plates

http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07648v1,"Electron Heating in Low Mach Number Perpendicular shocks. I. Heating
  Mechanism","  Recent X-ray observations of merger shocks in galaxy clusters have shown that
the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons hotter than the
electrons. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study
the physics of electron irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number
shocks, for a representative case with sonic Mach number of 3 and plasma beta
of 16. We find that two basic ingredients are needed for electron entropy
production: (i) an electron temperature anisotropy, induced by field
amplification coupled to adiabatic invariance; and (ii) a mechanism to break
the electron adiabatic invariance itself. In shocks, field amplification occurs
at two major sites: at the shock ramp, where density compression leads to an
increase of the frozen-in field; and farther downstream, where the shock-driven
proton temperature anisotropy generates strong proton cyclotron and mirror
modes. The electron temperature anisotropy induced by field amplification
exceeds the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of
whistler waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for
efficient entropy production. We find that the electron heating efficiency
displays only a weak dependence on mass ratio (less than 30 percent drop, as we
increase the mass ratio from 49 up to 1600). We develop an analytical model of
electron irreversible heating and show that it is in excellent agreement with
our simulation results.

it leads one to conclude that steady jets are not powered by the black hole

light curve from Kepler shows episodes of unique and inexplicable day-long dips
with up to 20% dimming. Here, I provide a light curve of 1338 Johnson B-band
magnitudes from 1890 to 1989 taken from archival photographic plates at
Harvard. KIC8462852 displays a secular dimming at an average rate of
0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,
KIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because
nearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is
unprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve
provides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light
curve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and
the day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for
unique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects
are very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not
appear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must
be some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of
dust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7
times as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the
comet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000

http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03747v1,Approximate Bayesian computation with the Wasserstein distance,"  A growing number of generative statistical models do not permit the numerical
evaluation of their likelihood functions. Approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) has become a popular approach to overcome this issue, in which one
simulates synthetic data sets given parameters and compares summaries of these
data sets with the corresponding observed values. We propose to avoid the use
of summaries and the ensuing loss of information by instead using the
Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions of the observed and
synthetic data. This generalizes the well-known approach of using order
statistics within ABC to arbitrary dimensions. We describe how recently
developed approximations of the Wasserstein distance allow the method to scale
to realistic data sizes, and propose a new distance based on the Hilbert
space-filling curve. We provide a theoretical study of the proposed method,
describing consistency as the threshold goes to zero while the observations are
kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows.
Various extensions to time series data are discussed. The approach is
illustrated on various examples, including univariate and multivariate g-and-k
distributions, a toggle switch model from systems biology, a queueing model,
and a L\'evy-driven stochastic volatility model.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11034v1,Failure Modes in Machine Learning Systems,"  In the last two years, more than 200 papers have been written on how machine
learning (ML) systems can fail because of adversarial attacks on the algorithms
and data; this number balloons if we were to incorporate papers covering
non-adversarial failure modes. The spate of papers has made it difficult for ML
practitioners, let alone engineers, lawyers, and policymakers, to keep up with
the attacks against and defenses of ML systems. However, as these systems
become more pervasive, the need to understand how they fail, whether by the
hand of an adversary or due to the inherent design of a system, will only
become more pressing. In order to equip software developers, security incident
responders, lawyers, and policy makers with a common vernacular to talk about
this problem, we developed a framework to classify failures into ""Intentional
failures"" where the failure is caused by an active adversary attempting to
subvert the system to attain her goals; and ""Unintentional failures"" where the
failure is because an ML system produces an inherently unsafe outcome. After
developing the initial version of the taxonomy last year, we worked with
security and ML teams across Microsoft, 23 external partners, standards
organization, and governments to understand how stakeholders would use our
framework. Throughout the paper, we attempt to highlight how machine learning

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12314v1,(Simulating) Coronal Mass Ejections in Active Stars,"  The stellar magnetic field completely dominates the environment around
late-type stars. It is responsible for driving the coronal high-energy
radiation (e.g. EUV/X-rays), the development of stellar winds, and the
generation transient events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
While progress has been made for the first two processes, our understanding of
the eruptive behavior in late-type stars is still very limited. One example of
this is the fact that despite the frequent and highly energetic flaring
observed in active stars, direct evidence for stellar CMEs is almost
non-existent. Here we discuss realistic 3D simulations of stellar CMEs,
analyzing their resulting properties in contrast with solar eruptions, and use
them to provide a common framework to interpret the available stellar
observations. Additionally, we present results from the first 3D CME
simulations in M-dwarf stars, with emphasis on possible observable signatures
imprinted in the stellar corona.

COVID-19 outbreak on female and male academics' research productivity in social
science. The lockdown has caused substantial disruptions to academic
activities, requiring people to work from home. How this disruption affects
productivity and the related gender equity is an important operations and
societal question. We collect data from the largest open-access preprint
repository for social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines
produced by 76,832 authors across 25 countries over a span of two years. We use
a difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock.
Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United
States, although the total research productivity increased by 35%, female
academics' productivity dropped by 13.9% relative to that of male academics. We
also show that several disciplines drive such gender inequality. Finally, we
find that this intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for academics in
top-ranked universities, and the effect exists in six other countries. Our work
points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding
that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It
also helps organizations realize the potential unintended consequences that can
arise from telecommuting.

photographically and visually early in the 20th century, but stopped some 50 or
60 years ago. This has been explained by the presence of a distant third star
in the system, which has now been detected spectroscopically with a period of
679 days. The plane of the orbit of the binary is changing relative to the line
of sight in response to perturbations from this third object. A recent analysis
by Milone et al. (M00) of all photometric material available for the system,
including a re-measurement of original Harvard plates, has confirmed earlier
reports of changes in the depth of the eclipses as a function of time, which
are due to the third star. In this paper we discuss our detailed analysis of
the eclipse amplitude measurements, and extract from them information on the
change in the inclination angle of the binary over the last century. Our use of
a much improved ephemeris for the system by Torres & Stefanik was found to be
crucial, and prompted us to re-determine all the amplitudes from the historical
data at our disposal, including the Harvard material used by M00.
Systematically lower measurements on the branches of the minima were properly
accounted for, and we made use of both a linear approximation to the time
variation of the inclination angle and a more realistic model based on the
theory of three-body interactions (""regression of the nodes"" effect). The nodal

  young star clusters in NGC 7252","  We have extended the study of the young star clusters observed in the merger
remnant galaxy NGC 7252 by obtaining K band photometry for these clusters. Our
K band data significantly complement the optical photometry and spectroscopy in
the literature: K band data are fundamental to study the Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) population of these clusters, since the AGB phase transition
(occuring between the age of 200 Myr and 1 Gyr) causes abrupt changes in the
near-infrared luminosity of the clusters while producing only small changes in
the optical. Therefore, the e.g. V-K colour is ideal to study this evolutionary
phase of stellar populations. For the present analysis we present models for
Simple Stellar Populations which include the contribution of the AGB stellar
phase, calibrated with the young and intermediate age star clusters of the
Magellanic Clouds. The comparison with the colour distribution of the NGC 7252
star clusters shows that they are indeed intermediate age clusters undergoing
the AGB phase transition. The AGB phase transition is observed for the first
time outside the Local Group. Most of the studied clusters span the very narrow
age range 300-500 Myr, and likely have metallicities 0.5-1 Z_{\odot}. A very
important exception is the cluster W32, which has already completed its AGB
epoch, its colours being consistent with an age of 1-2 Gyr. This impacts on the
duration of the merger-induced starburst. The strengths of the magnesium and
iron lines in the spectrum of the best observed cluster W3, and in the spectrum
of the diffuse central light of NGC 7252, do not show an overabundance in
alpha-elements, in contrast to the bulk stellar population of elliptical
galaxies.

identified in several globular clusters using Chandra or XMM X-ray
observations, using their soft thermal spectra. We report a complete census of
the qLMXB population in these clusters, identifying three additional probable
qLMXBs in NGC 6440. We conduct several analyses of the qLMXB population, and
compare it with the harder, primarily CV, population of low-luminosity X-ray
sources with 10^31<L_X<10^32.5 ergs/s. The radial distribution of our qLMXB
sample suggests an average system mass of 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2} Msun, consistent
with a neutron star and low-mass companion. Spectral analysis reveals that no
globular cluster qLMXBs, other than the transient in NGC 6440, require an
additional hard power-law component as often observed in field qLMXBs. We
identify an empirical lower luminosity limit of 10^32 ergs/s among globular
cluster qLMXBs. The bolometric luminosity range of qLMXBs implies (in the deep
crustal heating model of Brown and collaborators) low time-averaged mass
transfer rates, below the disk stability criterion. The X-ray luminosity
functions of the CV populations alone in NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc are shown to
differ. The distribution of qLMXBs among globular clusters is consistent with
their dynamical formation by either tidal capture or exchange encounters,
allowing us to estimate that seven times more qLMXBs than bright LMXBs reside
in globular clusters. The distribution of harder sources (primarily CVs) has a
weaker dependence upon density than that of the qLMXBs. Finally, we discuss
possible effects of core collapse and globular cluster destruction upon X-ray

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408413v2,Towards a More Standardized Candle Using GRB Energetics and Spectra,"  The use of GRB energetics for cosmography has long been advanced as a means
to probe out to high redshifts, to the epoch of deceleration. However, the
prompt energy release in GRBs, even when corrected for jetting geometry, is far
from being a standard candle. We explore the cosmographic potential of a GRB
standard candle based on the newly-discovered relation by Ghirlanda et al.
between the apparent geometry-corrected energies (E_gamma) and the peak of the
prompt burst spectrum (E_p). We present an explicit, self-consistent formalism
for correcting GRB energies with a thorough accounting for observational
uncertainties. In contrast to other work, we demonstrate that the current
sample of 19 GRBs is not yet cosmographically competitive with results from
other studies (e.g., SNe Ia). Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a
significant correlation across a range of cosmologies, the goodness of fit of
the data to a power law, depends strongly on input assumptions -- especially
the unknown density of the circumburst medium. Independent of assumptions, with
very few low-z bursts, the current sample is most sensitive to Omega_M but
essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda. The proper use of the relation clearly
brings GRBs an impressive step closer toward a standardizable candle, but until
the physical origin of the E_p-E_gamma relation is understood, calibrated with
a training set of low redshift bursts, and the major potential systematic
uncertainties and selection effects are addressed, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography (abridged).

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502559v2,Present and Future Prospects for GRB Standard Candles,"  Following our previous work, we conclude that a GRB standard candle
constructed from the Ghirlanda et al. power-law relation between the
geometry-corrected energy (E_gamma) and the peak of the rest-frame prompt burst
spectrum (E_p) is not yet cosmographically useful, despite holding some
potential advantages over SNe Ia. This is due largely to the small sample of
\~20 GRBs with the required measured redshifts, jet-breaks, and peak energies,
and to the strong sensitivity of the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to input
assumptions. The most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to the
generally unknown density (and density profile), of the circumburst medium.
Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a highly significant correlation over many
cosmologies, until the sample expands to include many low-z events, it will be
most sensitive to Omega_M but essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda and w,
with some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z GRB data alone. The relation
clearly represents a significant improvement in the search for an empirical GRB
standard candle, but is further hindered by an unknown physical basis for the
relation, the lack of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in a
cosmology-independent way, and several major potential systematic uncertainties
and selection effects. Until these concerns are addressed, a larger sample is
acquired, and attempts are made to marginalize or perform Monte Carlo
simulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography and especially the attempts to
combine GRBs with SNe Ia.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507266v2,The Effects of Reionization on Lyman-alpha Galaxy Surveys,"  Searches for Lyman-alpha emission lines are among the most effective ways to
identify high-redshift galaxies. They are particularly interesting because they
probe not only the galaxies themselves but also the ionization state of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). The observed line strengths depend on the amount by
which each photon is able to redshift away from line center before encountering
neutral gas and hence on the size distribution of HII regions surrounding the
sources. Here, we use an analytic model of that size distribution to study the
effects of reionization on the luminosity function of Lyman-alpha emitters and
their observed spatial distribution. Our model includes the clustering of
high-redshift galaxies and thus contains ionized bubbles much larger than those
expected around isolated galaxies. As a result, Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies
remain visible earlier in reionization: we expect the number counts to decline
by only a factor ~2 (or 10) when the mean ionized fraction falls to x_i~0.75
(or 0.5) in the simplest model. Moreover, the absorption is not uniform across
the sky: galaxies remain visible only if they sit inside large bubbles, which
become increasingly rare as x_i decreases. Thus, the size distribution also
affects the apparent clustering of Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. On large
scales, it traces that of the large bubbles, which in our model are more biased
than the galaxies. On small scales, the clustering increases rapidly as x_i
decreases because large HII regions surround strong galaxy overdensities, so a
survey automatically selects only those galaxies with neighbours. The
transition between these two regimes occurs at the characteristic bubble size.
Hence, large Lyman-alpha galaxy surveys have the potential to measure directly
the size distribution of HII regions during reionization.

past several years, and we have already shown that the observed properties of
Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z=3 can be explained well by the massive
galaxies in the simulations. Here we extend our study to z=6 and show that we
obtain good agreement for the LBGs at the bright-end of the luminosity function

has a peak at z= 5-6, and that the current LBG surveys at z=6 are missing a
significant number of faint galaxies that are dimmer than the current magnitude

z=6 by the Pop II stars in ordinary galaxies. We also estimate the LF of

  Distribution of Large Earthquakes","  Rank-ordering statistics provides a perspective on the rare, largest elements
of a population, whereas the statistics of cumulative distributions are
dominated by the more numerous small events. The exponent of a power law
distribution can be determined with good accuracy by rank-ordering statistics
from the observation of only a few tens of the largest events. Using analytical
results and synthetic tests, we quantify the systematic and the random errors.
  We also study the case of a distribution defined by two branches, each having
a power law distribution, one defined for the largest events and the other for
smaller events, with application to the World-Wide (Harvard) and Southern
California earthquake catalogs. In the case of the Harvard moment catalog, we
make more precise earlier claims of the existence of a transition of the
earthquake magnitude distribution between small and large earthquakes; the
$b$-values are $b_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$ for large shallow earthquakes and $b_1 =
1.00 \pm 0.02$ for smaller shallow earthquakes. However, the cross-over
magnitude between the two distributions is ill-defined. The data available at
present do not provide a strong constraint on the cross-over which has a $50\%$
probability of being between magnitudes $7.1$ and $7.6$ for shallow
earthquakes; this interval may be too conservatively estimated. Thus, any
influence of a universal geometry of rupture on the distribution of earthquakes
world-wide is ill-defined at best. We caution that there is no direct evidence
to confirm the hypothesis that the large-moment branch is indeed a power law.
In fact, a gamma distribution fits the entire suite of earthquake moments from
the smallest to the largest satisfactorily. There is no evidence that the

intersection numbers on a stable map moduli space. As an application, in Mirror
Principle III, Sec 5.4, an outline was given in the case of genus zero with
target a flag manifold. The results on $S^1$ fixed points in this paper are
used here to do explicit Mirror Principle computations in the case of
Grassmannian manifolds. In fact, Mirror Principle computations involve only a
certain distinguished subcollection of the $S^1$-fixed-point components. These
components are identified and are labelled by Young tableaus. The
$S^1$-equivariant Euler class $e_{S^1}$ of the normal bundle to these

$e_{S^1}$ directly from the Young tableau is given. From this, the
aforementioned intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable maps can be
worked out. Two examples are given to illustrate our method. Using our method,
the A-model for Calabi-Yau complete intersections in a Grassmannian manifold

  Distribution of Earthquake Magnitudes","  We develop a new method for the statistical esitmation of the tail of the
distribution of earthquake sizes recorded in the Worldwide Harvard catalog of
seismic moments converted to mW-magnitudes (1977-2004 and 1977-2006). We show
that using the set of maximum magnitudes (the set of T-maxima) in windows of
duration T days provides a significant improvement over existing methods, in
particular (i) by minimizing the negative impact of time-clustering of
foreshock / main shock /aftershock sequences in the estimation of the tail of
the magnitude distribution, and (ii) by providing via a simulation method
reliable estimates of the biases in the Moment estimation procedure (which
turns out to be more efficient than the Maximum Likelihood estimation). Using a
simulation method, we have determined the optimal window size of the T-maxima
to be T=500 days. We have estimated the following quantiles of the distribution
of T-maxima of earthquake magnitudes for the whole period 1977-2006:
Q_{0.16}(Mmax)=9.3, Q_{0.5}(Mmax)=9.7 and Q_{0.84}(Mmax)=10.3. Finally, we
suggest two more stable statistical characterristics of the tail of the
distribution of earthquake magnitudes: the quantile QT(q) of a high probability
level q for the T-maxima, and the probability of exceedence for a high
threshold magnitude. We obtained the following sample estimates for the global
Harvard catalog: QT(q=0.98)=8.6 +- 0.2 and a probability for the T-maxima to
exceed magnitude 8 equal to 0.13-0.20. The comparison between our estimates for
the two periods 1977-2004 and 1977-2006, where the later period includes the
great Sumatra earthquake, 24.12.2004, mW=9.0, confirms the instability of the

short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. These observations allow us
to characterize the galactic and local environments of short GRBs as a powerful
constraint on the nature of their progenitors. Using the HST data for 10 short
GRB hosts we determine the host morphological properties, measure precise
physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the galaxy centers, and study
the locations of short GRBs relative to their host light distributions. We find
that most short GRB hosts have exponential disk profiles, characteristic of
late-type galaxies, but with a median size that is twice as large as that of
long GRB hosts, commensurate with their higher luminosities. The observed
distribution of projected physical offsets, supplemented by ground-based
measurements, has a median of ~5 kpc, about 5 times larger than for long GRBs,
and in good agreement with predicted offset distributions for NS-NS binary
mergers. For the short GRB population as a whole we find the following robust
constraints: (i) >25% have projected offsets of <10 kpc; and (ii) >5% have
projected offsets of >20 kpc. We find no clear systematic trends for the offset
distribution of short GRBs with and without extended soft emission. While the
physical offsets are larger than for long GRBs, the distribution of
host-normalized offsets is nearly identical due to the larger size of short GRB
hosts. Finally, unlike long GRBs, which are concentrated in the brightest
regions of their host galaxies, short GRBs appear to under-represent the light
distribution of their hosts; this is true even in comparison to core-collapse
and Type Ia supernovae. Based on these results, we conclude that short GRBs are
consistent with a progenitor population of NS-NS binaries.

  Hole Spin, Disk Thickness, and Magnetic Field Geometry","  The standard general relativistic model of a razor-thin accretion disk around
a black hole, developed by Novikov & Thorne (NT) in 1973, assumes the shear
stress vanishes at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and
that, outside the ISCO, the shear stress is produced by an effective turbulent
viscosity. However, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it is
uncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the ISCO, and the
magnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may contain
large-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity.
We describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spin
parameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the NT model.
Our fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity)
poloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order to
match the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane. For a thin disk
with an aspect ratio |h/r| ~ 0.07 around a non-spinning black hole, we find a
decrease in the accreted specific angular momentum of 2.9% relative to the NT
model and an excess luminosity from inside the ISCO of 3.5%. The deviations in
the case of spinning black holes are of the same order. In addition, the
deviations decrease with decreasing |h/r|. We therefore conclude that
magnetized thin accretion disks in x-ray binaries in the thermal/high-soft
spectral state ought to be well-described by the NT model, especially at
luminosities below 30% of Eddington where we expect a very small disk thickness
|h/r| <~ 0.05. We also discuss how the stress and the luminosity inside the
ISCO depend on the assumed initial magnetic field geometry. (abridged)

molecular cloud cores formed in 2 very high resolution 3D molecular cloud
simulations.The simulations have been performed using the code RAMSES at an
effective resolution of 4096^3.One simulation represents a mildly
magnetically-supercritical cloud and the other a strongly
magnetically-supercritical cloud.A noticeable difference between the 2
simulations is the core formation efficiency (CFE) of the high density cores.In
the strongly supercritical simulations the CFE is ~33 % per free-fall time of
the cloud tff,cl, whereas in the mildly supercritical simulations this value
goes down to ~6%/tff,cl. A comparison of the intrinsic specific angular
momentum j3D distributions of the cores with the distribitions of j2D derived
using synthetic 2D velocity maps of the cores,shows that the synthetic
observations tend to overestimate the true value of j by a factor of ~10.The
origin of this discrepancy lies in the fact that contrary to the intrinsic
determination which sums up the individual gas parcels contributions to j, the
determination of j using the observational procedure which is based on a
measurement on the global velocity gradient under the hypothesis of uniform
rotation smoothes out the complex fluctuations present in the 3D velocity
field. Our results provide a natural explanation for the discrepancy by a
factor ~10 observed between the intrinsic 3D distributions of j and the
corresponding distributions derived in real observations.We suggest that
measurements of j which are based on the measurement of the observed global

a more accurate estimate of j in the cores.

at redshifts 1<z<5.2 using all three cameras onboard the Spitzer Space
Telescope. The resulting spectral energy distributions unambiguously show a
stellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with the
active nucleus in 59. Using a new restframe S_3um/S_1.6um versus S_um/S_3um
criterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from the
stellar population can be measured. For these radio galaxies, the median
stellar mass is high, 2x10^11 M_sun, and remarkably constant within the range
1<z<3. At z>3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease in
stellar mass. This suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk of
their stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition of
stellar and AGN emission is needed.
  The restframe 500 MHz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated with
stellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dust
luminosity. This suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range of
Eddington ratios. We also present new Very Large Array 4.86 and 8.46 GHz
imaging of 14 radio galaxies and find that radio core dominance --- an
indicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dust
luminosity. While all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2
AGNs, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependent
models if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type
2 to unobscured type 1 AGNs rather than a clear dichotomy. Finally, four radio
galaxies have nearby (<6"") companions whose mid-IR colors are suggestive of
their being AGNs. This may indicate an association between radio galaxy
activity and major mergers.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0415v1,The Radio Activity-Rotation Relation of Ultracool Dwarfs,"  [Abridged] We present a new radio survey of about 100 late-M and L dwarfs
undertaken with the VLA. The sample was chosen to explore the role of rotation
in the radio activity of ultracool dwarfs. Combining the new sample with
results from our previous studies and from the literature, we compile the
largest sample to date of ultracool dwarfs with radio observations and measured
rotation velocities (167 objects). In the spectral type range M0-M6 we find a
radio activity-rotation relation, with saturation at log(L_rad/L_bol) 10^(-7.5)
above vsini~5 km/s, similar to the relation in H-alpha and X-rays. However, at
spectral types >M7 the ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity increases
regardless of rotation velocity, and the scatter in radio luminosity increases.
In particular, while the most rapid rotators (vsini>20 km/s) exhibit
""super-saturation"" in X-rays and H-alpha, this effect is not seen in the radio.
We also find that ultracool dwarfs with vsini>20 km/s have a higher radio
detection fraction by about a factor of 3 compared to objects with vsini<10
km/s. When measured in terms of the Rossby number (Ro), the radio
activity-rotation relation follows a single trend and with no apparent
saturation from G to L dwarfs and down to Ro~10^-3; in X-rays and H-alpha there
is clear saturation at Ro<0.1, with super-saturation beyond M7. A similar trend
is observed for the radio surface flux (L_rad/R^2) as a function of Ro. The
continued role of rotation in the overall level of radio activity and in the
fraction of active sources, and the single trend of L_rad/L_bol and L_rad/R^2
as a function of Ro from G to L dwarfs indicates that rotation effects are
important in regulating the topology or strength of magnetic fields in at least
some fully-convective dwarfs. The fact that not all rapid rotators are detected
in the radio provides additional support to the idea of dual dynamo states.

invoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has
characteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the
torus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are
substantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the
vertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and
warps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly
attributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:
misalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and
turbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN
luminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations
of gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities
in AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent. We argue that it is not
possible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (N_H)
distribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping on
small scales the predicted N_H distribution is in good agreement with
observations from 10^20-27 cm^-2. We examine how N_H scales with galaxy and AGN
properties, and find that AGN feedback may be necessary to explain some trends
with luminosity and/or redshift. The torus is not merely a bystander or passive
fuel source for accretion, but is itself the mechanism driving accretion.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1236v3,Why Are AGN and Host Galaxies Misaligned?,"  It is well-established observationally that the characteristic angular
momentum axis on small scales around AGN, traced by radio jets and the putative
torus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum axis of the
host galaxy. In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in
high-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and
inflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy
mergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can
sometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly
off-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth
and trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,
self-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in
the potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip
or re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the
presence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host
galaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be
an indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this
conclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean
that even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to
maximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and
inefficient jet formation. Even more random orientations are possible if there
is further, un-resolved clumpiness in the gas, and more ordered accretion may
occur if the inflow is slower and not self-gravitating.

  HLSJ091828.6+514223","  During our Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) of massive galaxy clusters, we have
discovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster Abell 773,
which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z=5.2429.
This source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered by
Herschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mJy at 500\micron)
and its high redshift. The dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not the
cluster itself. The source has a far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of L_FIR= 1.1
10^{14}/\mu Lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. We
report here the redshift identification through CO lines with the IRAM-30m, and
the analysis of the gas excitation, based on CO(7-6), CO(6-5), CO(5-4) detected
at IRAM and the CO(2-1) at the EVLA. All lines decompose into a wide and strong
red component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.
Assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ULIRG) CO-to-H2 conversion ratio, the H2
mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu Mo, of which one third is in a cool component. From the
CI line we derive a CI/H2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that in
other ULIRGs. The H2O line is strong only in the red velocity component, with
an intensity ratio I(H_2O)/I(CO) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local FIR
radiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (AGN) component. We detect the
[NII]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. It shows comparable blue and

http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5520v2,Using Colors to Improve Photometric Metallicity Estimates for Galaxies,"  There is a well known correlation between the mass and metallicity of
star-forming galaxies. Because mass is correlated with luminosity, this
relation is often exploited, when spectroscopy is not available, to estimate
galaxy metallicities based on single band photometry. However, we show that
galaxy color is typically more effective than luminosity as a predictor of
metallicity. This is a consequence of the correlation between color and the
galaxy mass-to-light ratio and the recently discovered correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and residuals from the mass-metallicity relation. Using
Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy of 180,000 nearby galaxies, we derive
""LZC relations,"" empirical relations between metallicity (in seven common
strong line diagnostics), luminosity, and color (in ten filter pairs and four
methods of photometry). We show that these relations allow photometric
metallicity estimates, based on luminosity and a single optical color, that are
50% more precise than those made based on luminosity alone; galaxy metallicity
can be estimated to within 0.05 - 0.1 dex of the spectroscopically-derived
value depending on the metallicity diagnostic used. Including color information
in metallicity estimates also reduces systematic biases for populations skewed
toward high or low SFR environments, as we illustrate using the host galaxy of
the supernova SN 2010ay. This new tool will lend more statistical power to
studies of galaxy populations, such as supernova and gamma-ray burst (GRB) host
environments, in ongoing and future wide field imaging surveys.

simultaneously probe their magnetic and rotational properties. The brown dwarf
2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5)
detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the
Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar
to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse
periodicity; previous VLA observations detected quiescent emission a factor of
~100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we
present 14 hours of Very Large Array observations of this object that reveal a
series of pulses at ~6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the
pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared
to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of ~1.77 hr and identify it
with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in
a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10
GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2M 1047+21 reaches
at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly-rotating
radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those
of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields
and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this
kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and
magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both
theories and observational data are currently scarce.

interferometers is expected to occur within the next few years. These
interferometers will detect the mergers of compact object binaries composed of
neutron stars and/or black holes to a fiducial distance of ~200 Mpc and a
localization region of ~100 sq. deg. To maximize the science gains from such GW
detections it is essential to identify electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The
most promising such counterpart is optical/IR emission powered by the
radioactive decay of r-process elements synthesized in the neutron-rich merger
ejecta - a ""kilonova"". Here we present detailed simulated observations that
encompass a range of strategies for kilonova searches during GW follow-up. We
assess both the detectability of kilonovae and our ability to distinguish them
from a wide range of contaminating transients. We find that if pre-existing
template images for the localization region are available, then nightly
observations to a depth of i=24 mag and z=23 mag are required to achieve a 95%
detection rate; observations that commence within 12 hours of trigger will also
capture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta
properties. We also find that kilonovae can be robustly separated from other
types of transients utilizing cuts on color (i-z > 0 mag) and rise time (< 4
days). In the absence of a pre-existing template the observations must reach ~1
mag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate, but robust rejection of
contaminants can still be achieved. Motivated by the results of our simulations
we discuss the expected performance of current and future wide-field telescopes
in achieving these observational goals, and find that prior to LSST the Dark
Energy Camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope and Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru
8-m telescope offer the best kilonova discovery potential.

large volumes of data, which makes their application to large scale studies
challenging. We develop a scalable approach that relies only on user names to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06905v1,A Theory for the Variation of Dust Attenuation Laws in Galaxies,"  In this paper, we provide a physical model for the origin of variations in
the shapes and bump strengths of dust attenuation laws in galaxies by combining
a large suite of cosmological ""zoom-in"" galaxy formation simulations with 3D
Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer calculations. We model galaxies over 3
orders of magnitude in stellar mass, ranging from Milky Way like systems
through massive galaxies at high-redshift. Critically, for these calculations
we employ a constant underlying dust extinction law in all cases, and examine
how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impact the resultant
attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant
dust extinction curve, we find dramatic variations in the derived attenuation
laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the
complexities of star-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young
stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old
stars steepen curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we
find dramatic variation in the 2175 Angstrom ultraviolet (UV) bump strength,
including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These bump strengths are
primarily influenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model,
with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken
together, these results lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation
curve slope and 2175 Angstrom bump strength. Finally, we apply these results to
a 25 Mpc/h box cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in order to model the
expected dispersion in attenuation laws at integer redshifts from z=0-6. A
significant dispersion is expected at low redshifts, and decreases toward z=6.

  for Energetics and Rates","  We present broad-band observations of the afterglow and environment of the
short GRB 111020A. An extensive X-ray light curve from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton
and Chandra, spanning ~100 seconds to 10 days after the burst, reveals a
significant break at t~2 days with pre- and post-break decline rates of
alphaX,1 ~ -0.78 and alphaX,2<-1.7, respectively. Interpreted as a jet break,
we infer a collimated outflow with an opening angle of ~3-8 degrees. The
resulting beaming-corrected gamma-ray (10-1000 keV band) and blastwave kinetic
energies are (2-3)e48 erg and (0.3-2)e49 erg, respectively, with the range
depending on the unknown redshift of the burst. We report a radio afterglow
limit of <39 microJy (3-sigma) from EVLA observations which, along with our
finding that vc<vX, constrains the circumburst density to n~0.01-0.1 cm^(-3).
Optical observations provide an afterglow limit of i>24.4 mag at 18 hours after
the burst, and reveal a potential host galaxy with i~24.3 mag. The
sub-arcsecond localization from Chandra provides a precise offset of
0.80""+/-0.11"" (1-sigma) from this galaxy corresponding to an offset of 5-7 kpc
for z=0.5-1.5. We find a high excess neutral Hydrogen column density of
(7.5+/-2.0)e21 cm^(-2) (z=0). Our observations demonstrate that a growing
fraction of short GRBs are collimated which may lead to a true event rate of
>100-1000 Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1), in good agreement with the NS-NS merger rate of
~200-3000 Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1). This consistency is promising for coincident short
GRB-gravitational wave searches in the forthcoming era of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05858v1,"The IRX-Beta Dust Attenuation Relation in Cosmological Galaxy Formation
  Simulations","  We utilise a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of
galaxy formation to investigate the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV)
slope, beta, and the ratio of the infrared luminosity to UV luminosity (IRX) in
the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies. We employ dust radiative
transfer calculations in which the SEDs of the stars in galaxies propagate
through the dusty interstellar medium. Our main goals are to understand the
origin of, and scatter in the IRX-beta relation; to assess the efficacy of
simplified stellar population synthesis screen models in capturing the
essential physics in the IRX-beta relation; and to understand systematic
deviations from the canonical local IRX-beta relations in particular
populations of high-redshift galaxies. Our main results follow. Galaxies that
have young stellar populations with relatively cospatial UV and IR emitting
regions and a Milky Way-like extinction curve fall on or near the standard
Meurer relation. This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models.
Scatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older
stellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local
starbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex
geometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue
UV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction
curves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV
extinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive
a fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the
canonical local relation. Finally, we use these results to develop an
understanding for the location of two particularly enigmatic populations of
galaxies in the IRX-beta plane: z~2-4 dusty star forming galaxies, and z>5 star
forming galaxies.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03239v1,"Electron Heating in Low Mach Number Perpendicular shocks. II. Dependence
  on the Pre-Shock Conditions","  Recent X-ray observations of merger shocks in galaxy clusters have shown that
the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons being hotter than
the electrons. In this work, the second of a series, we investigate by means of
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations the efficiency of electron
irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number shocks. We consider
values of plasma beta (ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures) in the range
$4\lesssim \beta_{p0}\lesssim 32$ and sonic Mach number (ratio of shock speed
to pre-shock sound speed) in the range $2\lesssim M_{s}\lesssim 5$, as
appropriate for galaxy cluster shocks. As shown in Paper I, magnetic field
amplification - induced by shock compression of the pre-shock field, or by
strong proton cyclotron and mirror modes accompanying the relaxation of proton
temperature anisotropy - can drive the electron temperature anisotropy beyond
the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of whistler
waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for efficient
entropy production. We find that the post-shock electron temperature $T_{e2}$
exceeds the adiabatic expectation $T_{e2,\rm ad}$ by an amount
$(T_{e2}-T_{e2,\rm ad})/T_{e0}\simeq 0.044 \,M_s (M_s-1)$ (here, $T_{e0}$ is
the pre-shock temperature), which depends only weakly on the plasma beta, over
the range $4\lesssim \beta_{p0}\lesssim 32$ which we have explored, and on the
proton-to-electron mass ratio (the coefficient of $\simeq 0.044$ is measured
for our fiducial $m_i/m_e=49$, and we estimate that it will decrease to $\simeq
0.03$ for the realistic mass ratio). Our results have important implications
for current and future observations of galaxy cluster shocks in the radio band
(synchrotron emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) and at X-ray frequencies.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03098v1,"LSST Target-of-Opportunity Observations of Gravitational Wave Events:
  Essential and Efficient","  We present simulated observations to assess the ability of LSST and the WFD
survey to detect and characterize kilonovae - the optical emission associated
with binary neutron star (and possibly black hole - neutron star) mergers. We
expand on previous studies in several critical ways by exploring a range of
kilonova models and several choices of cadence, as well as by evaluating the
information content of the resulting light curves. We find that, depending on
the precise choice of cadence, the WFD survey will achieve an average kilonova
detection efficiency of $\approx 1.6-2.5\%$ and detect only $\approx 3-6$
kilonovae per year. The detected kilonovae will be within the detection volume
of Advanced LIGO/Virgo (ALV). By refitting the best resulting LSST light curves
with the same model used to generate them we find the model parameters are
generally weakly constrained, and are accurate to at best a factor of $2-3$.
Motivated by the finding that the WFD will yield a small number of kilonova
detections, with poor light curves and marginal information content, and that
the detections are in any case inside the ALV volume, we argue that
target-of-opportunity follow-up of gravitational wave triggers is a much more
effective approach for kilonova studies. We outline the qualitative foundation
for such a program with the goal of minimizing the impact on LSST operations.
We argue that observations in the $gz$-bands with a total time investment per
event of $\approx 1.5$ hour per 10 deg$^2$ of search area is sufficient to
rapidly detect and identify kilonovae with $\gtrsim 90\%$ efficiency. For an
estimated event rate of $\sim20$ per year visible to LSST, this accounts for
$\sim1.5\%$ of the total survey time. In this regime, LSST has the potential to
be a powerful tool for kilonovae discovery, with detected events handed off to
other narrow-field facilities for further monitoring.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00219v3,Breezing through the space environment of Barnard's Star b,"  A physically realistic stellar wind model based on Alfv\'en wave dissipation
has been used to simulate the wind from Barnard's Star and to estimate the
conditions at the location of its recently discovered planetary companion. Such
models require knowledge of the stellar surface magnetic field that is
currently unknown for Barnard's Star. We circumvent this by considering the
observed field distributions of three different stars that constitute
admissible magnetic proxies of this object. Under these considerations,
Barnard's Star b experiences less intense wind pressure than the much more
close-in planet Proxima~b and the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system. The milder
wind conditions are more a result of its much greater orbital distance rather
than in differences in the surface magnetic field strengths of the host stars.
The dynamic pressure experienced by the planet is comparable to present-day
Earth values, but it can undergo variations by factors of several during
current sheet crossings in each orbit. The magnetospause standoff distance
would be $\sim$\,$20 - 40$\,\% smaller than that of the Earth for an equivalent
planetary magnetic field strength.

cells is a time-consuming process requiring thousands of hours of laboratory
analysis. For a solar cell, the most important property is the power conversion
efficiency which is dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO)
values of the donor molecules. Recently, machine learning techniques have
proved to be very useful in building predictive models for HOMO values of donor
structures of Organic Photovoltaic Cells (OPVs). Since experimental datasets
are limited in size, current machine learning models are trained on data
derived from calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Molecular
line notations such as SMILES or InChI are popular input representations for
describing the molecular structure of donor molecules. The two types of line
representations encode different information, such as SMILES defines the bond
types while InChi defines protonation. In this work, we present an ensemble
deep neural network architecture, called SINet, which harnesses both the SMILES
and InChI molecular representations to predict HOMO values and leverage the
potential of transfer learning from a sizeable DFT-computed dataset- Harvard
CEP to build more robust predictive models for relatively smaller HOPV

http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04092v1,Coronal response to magnetically-suppressed CME events in M-dwarf stars,"  We report the results of the first state-of-the-art numerical simulations of
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) taking place in realistic magnetic field
configurations of moderately active M-dwarf stars. Our analysis indicates that
a clear, novel, and observable, coronal response is generated due to the
collapse of the eruption and its eventual release into the stellar wind.
Escaping CME events, weakly suppressed by the large-scale field, induce a
flare-like signature in the emission from coronal material at different
temperatures due to compression and associated heating. Such flare-like
profiles display a distinctive temporal evolution in their Doppler shift signal
(from red to blue), as the eruption first collapses towards the star and then
perturbs the ambient magnetized plasma on its way outwards. For stellar fields
providing partial confinement, CME fragmentation takes place, leading to rise
and fall flow patterns which resemble the solar coronal rain cycle. In strongly
suppressed events, the response is better described as a gradual brightening,
in which the failed CME is deposited in the form of a coronal rain cloud
leading to a much slower rise in the ambient high-energy flux by relatively
small factors ($\sim2-3$). In all the considered cases (escaping/confined) a
fractional decrease in the emission from mid-range coronal temperature plasma
occurs, similar to the coronal dimming events observed on the Sun. Detection of
the observational signatures of these CME-induced features requires a sensitive
next generation X-ray space telescope.

  Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Using the MMT Binospec","  The forthcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) experiment plans
to measure the effects of dark energy on the expansion of the Universe and
create a $3$D map of the Universe using galaxies up to $z \sim 1.6$ and QSOs up
to $z \sim 3.5$. In order to create this map, DESI will obtain spectroscopic
redshifts of over $30$ million objects; among them, a majority are \oii
emitting star-forming galaxies known as emission-line galaxies (ELGs). These
ELG targets will be pre-selected by drawing a selection region on the $g - r$
vs. $r - z$ colour-colour plot, where high redshift ELGs form a separate locus
from the lower redshift ELGs and interlopers. In this paper, we study the
efficiency of three ELG target selection algorithms -- the final design report
(FDR) cut based on the DEEP2 photometry, Number Density Modelling and Random
Forest -- to determine how the combination of these three algorithms can be
best used to yield a simple selection boundary that will be best suited to meet
DESI's science goals. To do this, we selected $17$ small patches in the DESI
footprint where we run the three target selection algorithms to pre-select ELGs
based on their photometry. We observed the pre-selected ELGs using the MMT
Binospec, which is similar in functionality to the DESI instrument, to obtain
their spectroscopic redshifts and fluxes of $1054$ ELGs. By analysing the
redshift and fluxing distribution of these galaxies, we find that although NDM
performed the best, simple changes in the FDR definition would also yield
sufficient performance.

$M_{\oplus}$, Proxima c is a prime direct imaging target for atmospheric
characterization. The latter can only be performed with a good understanding of
the space environment of the planet, as multiple processes can have profound
effects on the atmospheric structure and evolution. Here, we take one step in
this direction by generating physically-realistic numerical simulations of
Proxima's stellar wind, coupled to a magnetosphere and ionosphere model around
Proxima c. We evaluate their expected variation due to the magnetic cycle of
the host star, as well as for plausible inclination angles for the exoplanet
orbit. Our results indicate stellar wind dynamic pressures comparable to
present-day Earth, with a slight increase (by a factor of 2) during high
activity periods of the star. A relatively weak interplanetary magnetic field
at the distance of Proxima c leads to negligible stellar wind Joule heating of
the upper atmosphere (about $10\%$ of the solar wind contribution on Earth) for
an Earth-like planetary magnetic field ($0.3$ G). Finally, we provide an
assessment of the likely extreme conditions experienced by the exoplanet
candidate Proxima d, tentatively located at $0.029$ au with a minimum mass of
$0.29$ $M_{\oplus}$.

shrinks on a short viscous time scale. Using an analytical model, we calculate

advection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small
or very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the
temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is
quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular
velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long
before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is
positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing
outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will
tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated
accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars

  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect","  The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect of a cluster of galaxies is usually
measured after background radio sources are removed from the cluster field.
Gravitational lensing by the cluster potential leads to a systematic deficit in
the residual intensity of unresolved sources behind the cluster core relative
to a control field far from the cluster center. As a result, the measured
decrement in the Rayleigh-Jeans temperature of the cosmic microwave background
is overestimated. We calculate the associated systematic bias which is
inevitably introduced into measurements of the Hubble constant using the SZ
effect. For the cluster A2218, we find that observations at 15 GHz with a beam
radius of 0'.4 and a source removal threshold of 100 microJy underestimate the
Hubble constant by 6-10%. If the profile of the gas pressure declines more
steeply with radius than that of the dark matter density, then the ratio of
lensing to SZ decrements increases towards the outer part of the cluster.

background quasar passes within a few kpc from the center of the galactic disk.
Since galactic disks are rich in neutral hydrogen, the quasar spectrum will
likely be marked by a damped Lyman-alpha absorption trough at the lens
redshift. Therefore, the efficiency of searches for gravitational lensing with
sub-arcsecond splitting can be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude by focusing
on a subset of all bright quasars which show low-redshift (z<1) strong
Lyman-alpha absorption (N>10^{21} cm^{-2}}). The double-image signature of
lensing could, in principle, be identified spectroscopically and without the
need for high-resolution imaging. The absorption spectrum of a spiral lens
would show a generic double-step profile due to the superposition of the two
absorption troughs of the different images. Finally, we note that searches for
microlensing signatures of quasars with damped Lyman-alpha absorption could
calibrate the fraction of MACHOs in galactic halos at high redshift.

viscous heating mechanism, which is unknown. The electrons, however, can
exchange energy quite efficiently through Coulomb collisions and the emission
and absorption of synchrotron photons. We find that for accretion rates greater
than \sim 10^{-3} of the Eddington accretion rate, the electrons have a thermal
distribution throughout the accretion flow. For lower accretion rates, the
electron distribution function is determined by the electron's source of
heating, which is primarily adiabatic compression. Using the principle of
adiabatic invariance, we show that an adiabatically compressed collisionless
gas maintains a thermal distribution until the particle energies become
relativistic. We derive a new, non-thermal, distribution function which arises
for relativistic energies and provide analytic formulae for the synchrotron
radiation from this distribution. Finally, we discuss its implications for the

probe the superluminal nature of the expansion. If the synchrotron emission

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710127v1,Particle Heating by Alfvenic Turbulence in Hot Accretion Flows,"  Recent work on Alfvenic turbulence by Goldreich & Sridhar (1995; GS) suggests
that the energy cascades almost entirely perpendicular to the local magnetic
field. As a result, the cyclotron resonance is unimportant in dissipating the
turbulent energy. Motivated by the GS cascade, we calculate the linear
collisionless dissipation of Alfven waves with frequencies much less than the
proton cyclotron frequency, but with perpendicular wavelengths of order the
Larmor radius of thermal protons. In plasmas appropriate to hot accretion flows
(proton temperature much greater than electron temperature) the dissipated
Alfven wave energy primarily heats the protons. For a plasma with $\beta \lsim
5$, however, where $\beta$ is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic
pressure, the MHD assumptions utilized in the GS analysis break down before
most of the energy in Alfven waves is dissipated; how the cascade then proceeds
is unclear. Hot accretion flows, such as advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs), are expected to contain significant levels of MHD turbulence. This
work suggests that, for $\beta \gsim 5$, the Alfvenic component of such
turbulence primarily heats the protons. Significant proton heating is required

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710274v1,Lithium and binarity,"  We present an analysis of the lithium abundances in late spectral type
binaries of different ages. They belong to several open clusters (Pleiades,
Hyades and M67), as well as to Chromospherically Active Binary Systems (CABS).
All these binaries have reliable ages, since they are members of well-known
open clusters or, in the case of the CABS, some stellar parameters such masses
and radii are accurate enough to derive ages using theoretical isochrones.
Their age span covers from barely one hundred million years to several
gigayears. We have compared different stellar properties, such as lithium
abundances, stellar masses, effective temperatures and orbital periods.
  It is shown that, in general, close binaries have lithium abundances larger
than those characteristic of single stars or binaries with larger orbital
periods. The largest difference between the abundances of binaries and single
stars appears at Hyades' age. The origin of those overabundances are discussed
in the context of the proposed mechanisms for the lithium depletion phenomenon

afterglows are rarer than supernovae, they are detectable at greater distances

should be comparable at limiting magnitudes brighter than K=18. The actual rate
of afterglows is expected to be somewhat lower since only a fraction of all
gamma-ray selected GRBs were observed to have associated afterglows. However,
the rate could also be higher if the initial gamma-ray emission from GRB
sources is more beamed than their late afterglow emission. Hence, current and

than the observed galactic dust which is left behind. Such dust could cause the
falloff in flux at high-z without violating constraints on reddening or

expected from the theory of crystal growth and has been detected in samples of
interstellar dust. Carbon needles with conservative properties can supply the
necessary opacity, and would very likely be ejected from galaxies as required.

followed up with precision photometry and spectroscopy. This method is
particularly adequate for studying red giants in the Galactic bulge. Recently
we developed an efficient method capable of computing the lensing effect for
thousands of frequencies in a high-resolution stellar spectrum. Here we
demonstrate the effects of microlensing on synthesized optical spectra of red
giant model atmospheres. We show that different properties of the stellar
surface can be recovered from time-dependent photometry and spectroscopy of a
point-mass microlensing event with a small impact parameter. In this study we
concentrate on center-to-limb variation of spectral features. Measuring such
variations can reveal the depth structure of the atmosphere of the source star.

calculate the dynamics of accreting matter in the combined gravitational
potential of a host galaxy and a central black hole assuming a steady state,

depends primarily on the accretion rate. For large accretion rates, no simple,
smooth transition between a cooling flow and an accretion flow is possible; the
gas cools towards zero temperature just inside its sonic radius, which lies
well outside the region where the gravitational influence of the central black
hole is important. For accretion rates below a critical value, however, the
accreting gas evolves smoothly from a radiatively driven cooling flow at large
radii to a nearly adiabatic (Bondi) flow at small radii. We argue that this is
the relevant parameter regime for most observed cooling flows. The transition
from the cooling flow to the accretion flow should be observable in M87 with

Detection of their properties could provide important clues about the

rms scatter of 2% was observed for the optical flux fluctuations on the 0.1--2

entirely due to photometric noise (Stanek et al. 1999). The resulting upper
limits on the density fluctuations on scales of 20-200 AU around the source of
GRB990510, are lower than the inferred fluctuation amplitude on similar scales

the relative magnetic helicity associated with the large scale field can
escape, accompanied by an equal and opposite small scale contribution from the

present theoretical optical photometric light curves and polarization curves
for the CEGP systems, from reflected planetary light. Different particle sizes
of three condensates are considered. In the most reflective case, the
variability is $\approx 100$ micromagnitudes, which will be easily detectable
by the upcoming satellite missions MOST, COROT, and MONS, and possibly from the
ground in the near future. The least reflective case is caused by small, highly
absorbing grains such as solid Fe, with variation of much less than one
micromagnitude. Polarization for all cases is lower than current detectability
limits. We also discuss the temperature-pressure profiles and resulting
emergent spectra of the CEGP atmospheres. We discuss the observational results
of Tau Boo b by Cameron et al. (1999) and Charbonneau et al. (1999) in context
of our model results. The predictions - the shape and magnitude of the light
curves and polarization curves - are highly dependent on the size and type of
condensates present in the planetary atmosphere.

first observed in the optical and occurred in the weakly barred, almost face on

at least three other supernovae discovered in this century. No point source was
detected at the radio position of SN1979C in a 3' diameter half power response

signal had a 3$\sigma$ upper limit to the count rate of 1.2$\times 10^{-3}$ cps

ever x-ray flux limit of a Type II$_{L}$ SN in the higher energy band ($\geq$ 2
keV) which is an important diagnostic of the {\it outgoing} shock wave
ploughing through the circumstellar medium.

cosmologies, the smallest nonlinear objects are the numerous small halos that
condense with virial temperatures below 10,000 K. Such ``minihalos'' are not
yet resolved in large-scale three-dimensional cosmological simulations. Here we
employ a semi-analytic method, combined with three-dimensional simulations of
individual minihalos, to examine their importance during cosmological
reionization. We show that, depending on when reionization takes place, they
potentially play an important role as sinks of ionizing radiation. If
reionization occurs at sufficiently high redshifts (z_r > 20), the
intergalactic medium is heated to 10,000 K and most minihalos never form. On
the other hand, if z_r < 20, a significant fraction (>10 percent) of all
baryons have already collapsed into minihalos, and are subsequently removed
from the halos by photoevaporation as the ionizing background flux builds up.
We show that this process can require a significant budget of ionizing photons;
exceeding the production by a straightforward extrapolation back in time of
known quasar and galaxy populations by a factor of up to 10 and 3,

mass seeds forming at z>10, when typical values are assumed for the radiative
accretion efficiency and the bolometric accretion luminosity in Eddington
units. Nevertheless, SDSS 1044-0125 yields a non-trivial constraint on a
combination of these parameters. Extrapolating our model to future surveys, we
derive the highest plausible redshift for quasars which are not lensed or

one might suspect that the new solution would also be unstable. However, due to
the very high temperature of the accreting gas, thermal conduction is very
strong and could suppress the thermal instability. We analyze the role of
thermal conduction in both the hot settling flow and the SLE solution. In the
hot settling flow collisions are very rare. Therefore, thermal transport occurs
via free streaming of electrons along tangled magnetic field lines. We find
that conduction is strong enough to make the flow marginally stable. In
contrast, in the cooler SLE solution, conduction is via collisional,

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0107568v2,The Long-Term Future of Extragalactic Astronomy,"  If the current energy density of the universe is indeed dominated by a
cosmological constant, then high-redshift sources will remain visible to us
only until they reach some finite age in their rest-frame. The radiation
emitted beyond that age will never reach us due to the acceleration of the
cosmic expansion rate, and so we will never know what these sources look like
as they become older. As a source image freezes on a particular time frame
along its evolution, its luminosity distance and redshift continue to increase
exponentially with observation time. The higher the current redshift of a
source is, the younger it will appear as it fades out of sight. For the popular
set of cosmological parameters, I show that a source at a redshift z=5-10 will
only be visible up to an age of 4-6 billion years. Arguments relating the
properties of high-redshift sources to present-day counterparts will remain
indirect even if we continue to monitor these sources for an infinite amount of
time. These sources will not be visible to us when they reach the current age
of the universe.

the number of galaxies. Observing the power-spectra of these two sources would
probe the number density of the earliest galaxies and the typical mass of their
host dark matter halos. The enhanced amplitude of the 21cm fluctuations from
the era of Lyman-alpha coupling improves considerably the practical prospects
for their detection.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411379v2,Formation of a spiral galaxy in a major merger,"  We use numerical simulations to examine the structure of merger remnants
resulting from collisions of gas-rich spiral galaxies. When the gas fraction of
the progenitors is small, the remnants structurally and kinematically resemble
elliptical galaxies, in agreement with earlier work. However, if the progenitor
disks are gas-dominated, new types of outcomes are possible. In fact, we show
that a prominent disk may survive in certain cases. To illustrate this
scenario, we analyze an extreme example with progenitor galaxies consisting of
dark matter halos, pure gas disks, and no bulges, as might be appropriate for
mergers at high redshifts. While rapid star formation triggered by tidal
torques during the merger forms a central, rotating bulge in the remnant, not
all the gas is consumed in the burst. The remaining gas cools very quickly and
settles into an extended star-forming disk, yielding an object similar to a
spiral galaxy, and not an early type galaxy. This is contrary to the usual view
that major mergers invariably destroy disks. The morphological evolution of
galaxies can therefore be more complicated than often assumed, and in
particular, theoretical constraints based on the fragility of spiral disks need
to be reevaluated.

sources by large scale density modes makes reionization inhomogeneous and
introduces a spread to the reionization times of different regions with the

minimum mass of galaxies spatially non-uniform with a fluctuation amplitude
that increases towards small scales. These scale-dependent fluctuations modify
the shape of the power spectrum of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts in a way
that depends on the history of reionization. The resulting distortion of the
primordial power spectrum is significantly larger than changes associated with
uncertainties in the inflationary parameters, such as the spectral index of the

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606572v2,Thermal Evaporation of Gas from X-ray Clusters,"  A fraction of the thermal protons in the outer envelope of an X-ray cluster
have velocities that exceed the local escape speed from the cluster
gravitational potential. The Coulomb mean-free-path of these protons is larger
than the virial radius of the cluster at temperatures >2.5 keV. The resulting
leakage of suprathermal particles generates a collisionless shock in
neighboring voids and fills them with heat and magnetic fields. The momentum
flux of suprathermal particles cannot be confined by magnetic tension at the
typical field strength in the periphery of cluster halos (<<1 micro-gauss).
Over a Hubble time, thermal evaporation could drain up to a tenth of the
cluster gas at its virial temperature. The evaporated fraction could increase
dramatically if additional heat is deposited into the gas by cluster mergers,
active galactic nuclei or supernovae. Thermal evaporation is not included in
existing cosmological simulations since they are based on the fluid
approximation. Measurements of the baryon mass fraction in the outer envelopes
of hot clusters (through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect or X-ray emission) can
be used to empirically constrain their evaporation rate.

and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a

scaling picture of droplet excitations and a recent variational approach with
``broken replica symmetry''. It is argued that the power law distribution of
large thermally active excitations is a consequence of the continuous
statistical ``tilt'' symmetry of the directed polymer, the breaking of which
gives rise to the large active excitations in a manner analogous to the
appearance of Goldstone modes in pure systems with a broken continuous
symmetry.

presence of correlated disorder is studied using functional renormalization
group techniques. The model exhibits many of the features of the Bose glass
phase of type II superconductors induced by columnar defects, but may be more
directly applicable to charge density waves, incommensurate striped magnetic
phases, stacked membranes under tension, vicinal crystal surfaces, or
superconducting ``vortex--chains''. Below five dimensions, an epsilon expansion
for the stable zero temperature fixed point yields the properties of the glassy
phase. Transverse to the direction of correlation, the randomness induces
logarithmic growth of displacements. Displacements are strongly localized in
the correlation direction. The absence of a response to a weak applied
transverse field (transverse Meissner effect) is demonstrated analytically. In
this simple model, the localized phase is stable to point disorder, in contrast
to the behavior in the presence of dislocations, in which the converse is
believed to be true.

screening drastically lowers dislocation and disclination energies, and forces
crystalline membranes to melt at any finite temperature. We point out that

different logarithmically divergent energies. A similar asymmetry exists in the

disorder, the domain wall moves through the system in percolative fashion. At
depinning, the fraction of spins that are flipped by the proceeding avalanche
vanishes with the same exponent beta=5/36 as the infinite percolation cluster
in percolation theory. With decreasing disorder strength, however, the size of
the critical region decreases. Our numerical simulation data appear to reflect
a crossover behaviour to an exponent beta'=0 at zero disorder strength. The
conclusions of this paper strongly rely on analytical arguments. A scaling
theory in terms of the disorder strength and the magnetic field is presented
that gives the values of all critical exponent except for one, the value of
which is estimated from scaling arguments.

Treating magnetic excitations promoted by the field as Bose particles and using

magnetization m/m_{sat}=1/3 and a checkerboard structure at 1/2, and thereby
form magnetization plateaus. Supersolid phases appear around insulating SDW
phases by changing the magnetic field. Nature of these supersolid phases is
discussed in detail. We also demonstrate how the geometry of the
Shastry-Sutherland lattice affects dynamical properties of magnetic excitations
significantly and makes a novel type of quintuplet (S=2) boundstates condense

an intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process - pores form because the more
noble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters
via a spinodal decomposition process at the solid-electrolyte interface. At the
same time, the surface area continuously increases due to etching. Together,
these processes evolve a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum
model. The applications potential of nanoporous metals is enormous. For
instance, the high surface area of nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au can
be chemically tailored, making it suitable for sensor applications,

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404189v1,Asset Pricing and Earnings Fluctuations in a Dynamic Corporate Economy,"  We give a new predictive mathematical model for macroeconomics, which deals
specifically with asset prices and earnings fluctuations, in the presence of a
dynamic economy involving mergers, acquisitions, and hostile takeovers.
Consider a model economy with a large number of corporations $C_1, C_2, ...,
C_n$ of different sizes. We ascribe a degree of randomness to the event that
any particular pair of corporations $C_i, C_j$ might undergo a merger, with
probability matrix $p_{ij}$. Previous random-graph models set $p_{ij}$ equal to
a constant, while in a real-world economy, $p_{ij}$ is a complicated function
of a large number of variables. We combine techniques of artificial
intelligence and statistical physics to define a general class of mathematical
models which, after being trained with past market data, give numerical
predictions for certain quantities of interest including asset prices, earnings
fluctuations, and merger/acquisition likelihood. These new models might
reasonably be called ``cluster-size models.'' They partially capture the
complicated dependence of $p_{ij}$ on economic factors, and generate usable
predictions.

sweeps across a Feshbach resonance, from the atomic to the molecular side, in
an ultra cold Fermi system. The model allows us to relate the observed molecule
momentum distribution, including its dependence on the sweep rate, to
equilibrium properties of the initial state. For initial state near resonance,
we find that phase fluctuations sharply reduce the observed condensate
fraction. Moreover, for very fast sweeps and low temperatures, we predict a
surprising nonmonotonic dependence of the molecule condensate fraction on
detuning, that is a direct signature of quantum phase fluctuations. The
dependence of the total molecule number on sweep rate is found to be a
sensitive probe of pairing in the initial state, whether condensed or not.
Hence it can be utilized to establish the presence of a phase fluctuation

a brane-antibrane configuration, in a manner similar to the way a uniform

evolution of a fluxbrane after nucleation of p-branes. We find that
Kaluza-Klein fluxbranes do relax by forming brane-antibrane pairs or spherical
branes, but we also find that for fluxtubes with dilaton coupling in a
different range, the field strength does not relax, instead it becomes stronger
after each nucleation bounce. We speculate on a possible runaway instability of
such fluxtubes an an eventual breakdown of their classical description.

which a Hilbert space and quantum field operators are recovered from n-point
functions. However, the original version of the Wightman theorem is not
equipped to deal with gauge fields or fields taking values in a noncommutative

allows the fundamental fields to take values in an arbitrary topological
*-algebra. In particular, the construction applies to fields valued in a Lie
algebra representation, of the type required by Yang-Mills theory. This appears
to be the correct framework for a generalized reconstruction theorem amenable
to modern quantum theories such as gauge theories and matrix models. We obtain
the interesting result that a large class of quantum theories are expected to

negative charge $-q_1$ with mass $m_{1}$ and two positive charges $q_2$ and
$q_3$, with masses $m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$, respectively. We show that, for given
masses $m_{i}$, each instability domain is convex in the plane of the variables
$(q_{1}/q_{2}, q_{1}/q_{3})$. A new proof is given of the instability of muonic
ions $(\alpha, p, \mu^-)$. We then study stability in some critical regimes
where $q_3\ll q_2$: stability is sometimes restricted to large values of some
mass ratios; the behaviour of the stability frontier is established to leading
order in $q_3/q_2$. Finally we present some conjectures about the shape of the
stability domain, both for given masses and varying charges, and for given
charges and varying masses.

analyzed for the mean-field reaction-rate density R(\rho_A,\rho_B) =

from matched self-similar solutions in a reaction front (of width w \sim

exists if and only if m, n \geq 1, in which case the scaling exponents are
uniquely given by \alpha = (m-1)/2(m+1) and \beta = m/(m+1). In the diffusion

the broadening of the reaction front and the slowing of transients, are also

high density regions initially collapse into cylindrical structures, which
subsequently destabilize and break up into spherical aggregates. This paper
presents a theoretical description of the process, from the structure of the
collapsing cylinder to the spacing of the final aggregates. We show that
cylindrical collapse involves a delicate balance in which bacterial attraction
and diffusion nearly cancel, leading to corrections to the collapse laws
expected from dimensional analysis. The instability of a collapsing cylinder is
composed of two distinct stages: Initially, slow modulations to the cylinder
develop, which correspond to a variation of the collapse time along the
cylinder axis. Ultimately, one point on the cylinder pinches off. At this final
stage of the instability, a front propagates from the pinch into the remainder
of the cylinder. The spacing of the resulting spherical aggregates is
determined by the front propagation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0402045v1,Hybrid Particle-Fluid Modeling of Plasmas,"  There are many interesting physical processes which involve the generation of
high density plasmas in large volumes. However, when modeling these systems
numerically, the large densities and volumes present a significant
computational challenge. One technique for modeling plasma physics, the
particle in cell (PIC) approach, is very accurate but requires increasing
computation time and numerical resolution as the density of the plasma grows.
In this paper we present a new technique for mitigating the extreme
computational load as the plasma density grows by combining existing PIC
methods with a dielectric fluid approach. By using both descriptions in a
hybrid particle-fluid model, we now can probe the physics in large volume, high
density regions. The hybrid method also provides a smooth transition as the
plasma density increases and the ionization fraction grows to values that are
well described by the fluid description alone. We present the hybrid technique
and demonstrate the validity of the physical model by benchmarking against a
simple example with an analytic solution.

http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702186v1,Peer Instruction: Comparing Clickers to Flashcards,"  Peer Instruction (PI) is a student-centered instructional approach developed
at Harvard by Eric Mazur (1997). The method has been welcomed by the science
community and adopted by a large number of colleges and universities, due among
other reasons to its common sense approach and its documented effectiveness. In
PI, the progression of any given class depends on the outcome of real-time
student feedback to ConcepTests: multiple-choice conceptual questions. In the
early 1990s, students responded to ConcepTests using flashcards showing their
answer. Instructors would then estimate the proportion of students holding each
alternative conception. A few years later Mazur began using wireless handheld
devices - colloquially called clickers- to replace the flashcards. Previous
users of clickers in university classrooms had reported benefits such as
increased rates of attendance and decreased rates of attrition (Owens et al.,
2004; Lopez-Herrejon & Schulman, 2004). This paper empirically measures the
specific contribution of clickers to conceptual learning and traditional
problem solving skills as compared to low-budget flashcards. Results show that
clickers do not provide any learning advantage when compared to flashcards.
Nevertheless, clickers offer many advantages from a teaching perspective which

For both the model of exact learning from membership queries and the PAC model,
we show that under a widely held computational hardness assumption for

is that the corresponding Kraus operators form a representation of a Lie

Hamiltonian. This paper begins a systematic study of channels defined by
representations; the famous Werner-Holevo channel is one element of this
infinite class. We show that the channel derived from the defining
representation of SU(n) is a depolarizing channel for all $n$, but for most
other representations this is not the case. Since the Bloch sphere is not
appropriate here, we develop technology which is a generalization of Bloch's
technique. Our method works by representing the density matrix as a polynomial
in symmetrized products of Lie algebra generators, with coefficients that are
symmetric tensors. Using these tensor methods we prove eleven theorems, derive
many explicit formulas and show other interesting properties of quantum
channels in various dimensions, with various Lie symmetry algebras. We also

http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1170v2,The Collision Between The Milky Way And Andromeda,"  We use a N--body/hydrodynamic simulation to forecast the future encounter
between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies, given current observational
constraints on their relative distance, relative velocity, and masses. Allowing
for a comparable amount of diffuse mass to fill the volume of the Local Group,
we find that the two galaxies are likely to collide in a few billion years -
within the Sun's lifetime. During the the interaction, there is a chance that
the Sun will be pulled away from its present orbital radius and reside in an
extended tidal tail. The likelihood for this outcome increases as the merger
progresses, and there is a remote possibility that our Sun will be more tightly
bound to Andromeda than to the Milky Way before the final merger. Eventually,
after the merger has completed, the Sun is most likely to be scattered to the
outer halo and reside at much larger radii (>30 kpc). The density profiles of
the stars, gas and dark matter in the merger product resemble those of
elliptical galaxies. Our Local Group model therefore provides a prototype
progenitor of late--forming elliptical galaxies.

  for Probing Cosmic Reionization","  A new generation of radio telescopes are currently being built with the goal
of tracing the cosmic distribution of atomic hydrogen at redshifts 6-15 through
its 21-cm line. The observations will probe the large-scale brightness
fluctuations sourced by ionization fluctuations during cosmic reionization.
Since detailed maps will be difficult to extract due to noise and foreground
emission, efforts have focused on a statistical detection of the 21-cm
fluctuations. During cosmic reionization, these fluctuations are highly
non-Gaussian and thus more information can be extracted than just the
one-dimensional function that is usually considered, i.e., the correlation
function. We calculate a two-dimensional function that if measured
observationally would allow a more thorough investigation of the properties of
the underlying ionizing sources. This function is the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the difference in the 21-cm brightness temperature between
two points, as a function of the separation between the points. While the
standard correlation function is determined by a complicated mixture of
contributions from density and ionization fluctuations, we show that the
difference PDF holds the key to separately measuring the statistical properties
of the ionized regions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4481v1,Antitruncated Stellar Disks via Minor Mergers,"  We use hydrodynamic simulations of minor mergers of galaxies to investigate
the nature of surface brightness excesses at large radii observed in some
spiral galaxies: antitruncated stellar disks. We find that this process can
produce the antitruncation via two competing effects: (1) merger-driven gas
inflows that concentrate mass in the center of the primary galaxy and contract
its inner density profile; and (2) angular momentum transferred outwards by the
interaction, causing the outer disk to expand. In our experiments, this
requires both a significant supply of gas in the primary disk, and that the
encounter be prograde with moderate orbital angular momentum. The stellar
surface mass density profiles of our remnants both qualitatively and
quantitatively resemble the broken exponentials observed in local face--on
spirals that display antitruncations. Moreover, the observed trend towards more
frequent antitruncation relative to classical truncation in earlier Hubble
types is consistent with a merger-driven scenario.

have plate tectonics. We demonstrate that as planetary mass increases, the
shear stress available to overcome resistance to plate motion increases while
the plate thickness decreases, thereby enhancing plate weakness. These effects
contribute favorably to the subduction of the lithosphere, an essential
component of plate tectonics. Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate
tectonics in the one earth-mass regime disappear as mass increases:
super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behaviour.

gravitational observatory LISA will detect cosmologically-distant coalescing
pairs of massive black holes, accurately measure their luminosity distance and
help identify an electromagnetic counterpart or a host galaxy. A wide variety
of new black hole studies and a gravitational version of Hubble's diagram
become possible if host galaxies are successfully identified. Furthermore, if
dark energy is a manifestation of large-scale modified gravity, deviations from
general relativistic expectations could become apparent in a gravitational
signal propagated over cosmological scales, especially when compared to the
electromagnetic signal from a same source. Finally, since inspirals of white
dwarfs into massive black holes at cosmological distances may permit pre-merger
localizations, we suggest that careful monitoring of these events and any
associated electromagnetic counterpart could lead to high-precision
cosmological measurements with LISA.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2412v2,Brane Inflation and the Overshoot Problem,"  We investigate recent claims that brane inflation solves the overshoot
problem through a combination of microphysical restrictions on the phase space
of initial conditions and the existence of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)
attractor in regimes where the slow-roll attractor does not apply. Carrying out
a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space allowed by the latest advances
in brane inflation model-building, we find that these restrictions are
insufficient to solve the overshoot problem. The vast majority of the phase
space of initial conditions is still dominated by overshoot trajectories. We
present an analytic proof that the brane-inflationary attractor must be close
to the slow-roll limit, and update the predictions for observables such as
non-Gaussianity, cosmic string tension and tensor modes.

characteristic density profile marked by a central concentration of dark
matter. The observed mass fraction within a projected radius of 150 kpc is
twice that found in state-of-the-art dark matter simulations of the standard
Lambda-CDM cosmology. A central baryon enhancement that could explain this
discrepancy is not observed, leaving a major puzzle. We propose a solution
based on the merger histories of clusters. A significant fraction of the final
dark matter content of a cluster halo originates within galaxy-sized halos, in
which gas can cool and compress the dark matter core to high densities. The
subsequent tidal stripping of this compressed dark matter occurs in denser
regions that are closer to the center of the cluster halo. Eventually, the
originally cooled gas must be dispersed into the intracluster medium through
feedback, for consistency with observations that do not find central baryon
enhancements in clusters. Still, the early adiabatic compression of the
galactic dark matter leaves a net effect on the cluster. Using a simple model
for this process, we show that the central cluster profile is substantially
modified, potentially explaining the observed discrepancy.

inevitably induce large periodic shifts in the broad emission lines of any
associated quasar(s). The probability of finding a binary in tighter

responsible for the formation of long tails and bridges of stars during galaxy

be described within the impulse approximation. The traditional impulse
approximation, however, does not distinguish between prograde and retrograde

that scale that are accessible to an observer. This number varies with cosmic

http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2027v2,Interpreting MAD within multiple accretion regimes,"  General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of accreting
black holes in the radiatively inefficient regime show that systems with
sufficient magnetic poloidal flux become magnetically arrested disc (MAD)
systems, with a well-defined relationship between the magnetic flux and the
mass accretion rate. Recently, Zamaninasab (2014) report that the jet magnetic
flux and accretion disc luminosity are tightly correlated over 7 orders of
magnitude for a sample of 76 radio-loud active galaxies, concluding that the
data are explained by the MAD mode of accretion. Their analysis assumes
radiatively efficient accretion, and their sample consists primarily of
radiatively efficient sources, while GRMHD simulations of MAD thus far have
been carried out in the radiatively inefficient regime. We propose a model to
interpret MAD systems in the context of multiple accretion regimes, and apply
it to the sample in Zamaninasab (2014), along with additional radiatively
inefficient sources from archival data. We show that most of the radiatively
inefficient radio-loud galaxies are consistent with being MAD systems. Assuming
the MAD relationship found in radiatively inefficient simulations holds at
other accretion regimes, a significant fraction of our sample can be candidates
for MAD systems. Future GRMHD simulations have yet to verify the validity of
this assumption.

distribution is commonly probed through X-ray emission arising from thermal
bremsstrahlung. The density profile thus obtained has been traditionally
modeled with a beta-profile, a simple function with only three parameters.
However, this model is known to be insufficient for characterizing the range of
cluster gas distributions, and attempts to rectify this shortcoming typically
introduce additional parameters to increase the fitting flexibility. We use
cosmological and physical considerations to obtain a family of profiles for the
gas with fewer parameters than the beta-model but which better accounts for
observed gas profiles over wide radial intervals.

forthcoming telescopes out to a distance of a few Mpc, where their proper
motion, radial velocity, and age, can be spectroscopically measured. In
difference from traditional cosmological messengers, such as photons,
neutrinos, or cosmic-rays, these stars shine and so their trajectories need not
be directed at the observer for them to be detected. Tracing the stars to their
parent galaxies as a function of speed and age will provide a novel test of the
equivalence principle and the standard cosmological parameters.
Semi-relativistic stars could also flag black hole binaries as gravitational
wave sources for the future eLISA observatory.

in the large-scale CMB temperature power spectrum allowing for the possibility
of non-negligible tensor contributions. Of 20 principal components of the
inflationary history, the suppression of power at low multipoles beginning with
a glitch at multipoles $\ell \sim 20-40$ implies deviations in 2-3 of them with
2-3$\sigma$ deviations in each, with larger values reflecting cases where
tensors are allowed.If tensors are absent, the corresponding $E$-mode
polarization features follow a similar pattern but are predicted to be up to
twice as large. They offer the opportunity to soon double the significance of
inflationary features or eliminate them as an explanation of temperature
features. The tensor degeneracy with features in the temperature power spectrum
is broken not only by $B$ but also by $E$-polarization. A precision measurement
of $E$-mode polarization at multipoles from $\ell\sim 20-60$ can potentially
provide an independent constraint on tensors that is less subject to dust
foreground uncertainties.

that the jet flow is characterized by a high radiative efficiency and that the
dissipative mechanism must be a powerful accelerator of non-thermal particles.
Shocks and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible
candidates for powering the jet emission. Recent progress via fully-kinetic
particle-in-cell simulations allows us to revisit this issue on firm physical
grounds. We show that shock models are unlikely to account for the jet
emission. In fact, when shocks are efficient at dissipating energy, they
typically do not accelerate particles far beyond the thermal energy, and vice
versa. In contrast, we show that magnetic reconnection can deposit more than
50% of the dissipated energy into non-thermal leptons as long as the energy
density of the magnetic field in the bulk flow is larger than the rest mass
energy density. The emitting region, i.e., the reconnection downstream, is
characterized by a rough energy equipartition between magnetic fields and
radiating particles, which naturally accounts for a commonly observed property
of blazar jets.

astrophysical events on human and land-based life. However, little has been
discussed on the resilience of life itself. Here we instead explore the
statistics of events that completely sterilise an Earth-like planet with planet
radii in the range $0.5-1.5 R_{Earth}$ and temperatures of $\sim 300 \;
\text{K}$, eradicating all forms of life. We consider the relative likelihood
of complete global sterilisation events from three astrophysical sources --
supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, large asteroid impacts, and passing-by stars. To
assess such probabilities we consider what cataclysmic event could lead to the
annihilation of not just human life, but also extremophiles, through the
boiling of all water in Earth's oceans. Surprisingly we find that although
human life is somewhat fragile to nearby events, the resilience of Ecdysozoa
such as \emph{Milnesium tardigradum} renders global sterilisation an unlikely
event.

  High Resolution Electron Microscope Data","  The tracing of neural pathways through large volumes of image data is an
incredibly tedious and time-consuming process that significantly encumbers
progress in neuroscience. We are exploring deep learning's potential to
automate segmentation of high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM)
image data to remove that barrier. We have started with neural pathway tracing
through 5.1GB of whole-brain serial-section slices from larval zebrafish
collected by the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University. This kind of
manual image segmentation requires years of careful work to properly trace the
neural pathways in an organism as small as a zebrafish larva (approximately 5mm
in total body length). In automating this process, we would vastly improve
productivity, leading to faster data analysis and breakthroughs in
understanding the complexity of the brain. We will build upon prior attempts to
employ deep learning for automatic image segmentation extending methods for
unconventional deep learning data.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00869v1,Training Machine Learning Models by Regularizing their Explanations,"  Neural networks are among the most accurate supervised learning methods in
use today. However, their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical
applications, especially when conditions in training may differ from those in
practice. Recent efforts to develop explanations for neural networks and
machine learning models more generally have produced tools to shed light on the
implicit rules behind predictions. These tools can help us identify when models
are right for the wrong reasons. However, they do not always scale to
explaining predictions for entire datasets, are not always at the right level
of abstraction, and most importantly cannot correct the problems they reveal.
In this thesis, we explore the possibility of training machine learning models
(with a particular focus on neural networks) using explanations themselves. We
consider approaches where models are penalized not only for making incorrect
predictions but also for providing explanations that are either inconsistent
with domain knowledge or overly complex. These methods let us train models
which can not only provide more interpretable rationales for their predictions
but also generalize better when training data is confounded or meaningfully
different from test data (even adversarially so).

  Galaxies","  In the local universe, black hole masses have been inferred from the observed
increase in the velocities of stars at the centres of their host galaxies. So
far, masses of supermassive black holes in the early universe have only been
inferred indirectly, using relationships calibrated to their locally observed
counterparts. Here, we use the latest observational constraints on the
evolution of stellar masses in galaxies to predict, for the first time, that
the region of influence of a central supermassive black hole at the epochs

current and upcoming telescopes. We show that the existence of the black hole
can be inferred from observations of the gas or stellar disc out to $> 0.5$ kpc
from the host halo at redshifts $z \gtrsim 6$. Such measurements will usher in
a new era of discoveries unraveling the formation of the first supermassive
black holes based on subarcsecond-scale spectroscopy with the $JWST$, $ALMA$,
and the $SKA$. The measured mass distribution of black holes will allow
forecasting of the future detection of gravitational waves from the earliest
black hole mergers.

additionally suppressed by the square of the ratio between the collision
frequency and the wave frequency. The electromagnetic counterparts that result

http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0020v1,A Runaway Black Hole in COSMOS: Gravitational Wave or Slingshot Recoil?,"  We present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the COSMOS survey at
z=0.359. Source CXOCJ100043.1+020637 (CID-42) presents two compact optical
sources embedded in the same galaxy. The distance between the 2, measured in
the HST/ACS image, is 0.495"" that, at the redshift of the source, corresponds
to a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset
between the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three
different optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments.
CID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong
redshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an
inverted P-Cygni profile. The Chandra and XMM data show that the absorption
line is variable in energy by 500 eV over 4 years and that the absorber has to
be highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft X-ray
spectrum. That these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be a
coincidence. We envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational wave
recoiling black hole (BH), caught 1-10 Myr after merging, (2) a Type 1/ Type 2
system in the same galaxy where the Type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effect
produced by a triple BH system. The first possibility gives us a candidate
gravitational waves recoiling BH with both spectroscopic and imaging
signatures. In the second case, the X-ray absorption line can be explained as a
BAL-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a Type 2 AGN) at the rearer one
(a Type 1 AGN), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving us
the first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured AGN.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05383v2,IDEAS: Immersive Dome Experiences for Accelerating Science,"  Astrophysics lies at the crossroads of big datasets (such as the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope and Gaia), open source software to visualize and
interpret high dimensional datasets (such as Glue, WorldWide Telescope, and
OpenSpace), and uniquely skilled software engineers who bridge data science and
research fields. At the same time, more than 4,000 planetariums across the
globe immerse millions of visitors in scientific data. We have identified the
potential for critical synergy across data, software, hardware, locations, and
content that -- if prioritized over the next decade -- will drive discovery in
astronomical research. Planetariums can and should be used for the advancement
of scientific research. Current facilities such as the Hayden Planetarium in
New York City, Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Morrison Planetarium in San
Francisco, the Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome Research Consortium in Cape
Town, and Visualization Center C in Norrkoping are already developing software
which ingests catalogs of astronomical and multi-disciplinary data critical for
exploration research primarily for the purpose of creating scientific
storylines for the general public. We propose a transformative model whereby
scientists become the audience and explorers in planetariums, utilizing
software for their own investigative purposes. In this manner, research
benefits from the authentic and unique experience of data immersion contained
in an environment bathed in context and equipped for collaboration.
Consequently, in this white paper we argue that over the next decade the
research astronomy community should partner with planetariums to create
visualization-based research opportunities for the field. Realizing this vision
will require new investments in software and human capital.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12279v1,"Fine-Grained, Language-Based Access Control for Database-Backed
  Applications","  Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority
than necessary. Since programs can access more data than they legitimately
need, flaws in security checks at the application level can enable malicious or
buggy code to view or modify data in violation of intended access control
policies.
  Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access
to data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often
have many users and consist of many different software components. First,
databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user
for each application user is impractical for applications with many users.
Second, different components of the same application may require different
authority, which would require creating different database users for different
software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly
limit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason,
we consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database
security.
  Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications
with least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts,
which we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications.
  Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of
ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB
enables reasoning about database access at the language level through
capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and
contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables.
ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy
to specify different access control policies for different components.
Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are
enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access
control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms
of the underlying database management system.
  Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to
implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts
for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB.
Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better
understand the language's performance overhead.
  Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for
enforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user
applications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers
to reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and
reuse third-party components with their own application-specific database
security policies.

dataset of pathologist annotations for algorithms that process whole slide
images (WSIs). We focus on data collection and evaluation of algorithm
performance in the context of estimating the density of stromal tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in breast cancer. Methods: We digitized 64
glass slides of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained ductal carcinoma core biopsies
prepared at a single clinical site. We created training materials and workflows
to crowdsource pathologist image annotations on two modes: an optical
microscope and two digital platforms. The workflows collect the ROI type, a
decision on whether the ROI is appropriate for estimating the density of sTILs,
and if appropriate, the sTIL density value for that ROI. Results: The pilot
study yielded an abundant number of cases with nominal sTIL infiltration.
Furthermore, we found that the sTIL densities are correlated within a case, and
there is notable pathologist variability. Consequently, we outline plans to
improve our ROI and case sampling methods. We also outline statistical methods
to account for ROI correlations within a case and pathologist variability when
validating an algorithm. Conclusion: We have built workflows for efficient data
collection and tested them in a pilot study. As we prepare for pivotal studies,
we will consider what it will take for the dataset to be fit for a regulatory
purpose: study size, patient population, and pathologist training and
qualifications. To this end, we will elicit feedback from the FDA via the
Medical Device Development Tool program and from the broader digital pathology
and AI community. Ultimately, we intend to share the dataset, statistical
methods, and lessons learned.

perturbed to reveal, if sufficiently well-sampled, the presence of a compact

of perturbed lightcurves must also be taken into account by systematic search
programs, to improve their event detection efficiency. The statistics of
perturbed lensing events, if carefully interpreted, could yield estimates of

the general q-point temperature correlation function of the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation. Our analysis is sensible specially for large angular
scales where the Kaiser-Stebbins effect is dominant. Then we concentrate our
study on the four-point function and in particular on its zero-lag limit,
namely, the excess kurtosis parameter, for which we obtain a predicted value of
$\sim 10^{-2}$. In addition, we estimate the cosmic variance for the kurtosis
due to a Gaussian fluctuation field, showing its dependence on the primordial
spectral index of density fluctuations $n$ and finding agreement with previous
published results for the particular case of a flat Harrison-Zel'dovich
spectrum. Our value for the kurtosis compares well with previous analyses but
falls below the threshold imposed by the cosmic variance when commonly accepted
parameters from string simulations are considered. In particular the
non-Gaussian signal is found to be inversely proportional to the scaling number
of defects, as could be expected by the central limit theorem.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9411054v2,"Probing Early Clustering with Lyman-Alpha Absorption Lines Beyond the
  Quasar Redshift","  Groups and clusters of galaxies hosting a quasar can be found through the
detection of Lyman-alpha absorption lines beyond the quasar redshift. The
effect occurs whenever the distortion to the redshift distribution of
Lyman-alpha clouds induced by the cluster potential extends beyond the
proximity effect of the quasar. Based on CDM cosmological models for the
evolution of structure, we predict the probability for finding lines beyond the
quasar redshift ($z_{abs}>z_Q$) under the assumption that the physical
properties of Lyman-alpha clouds are not affected by flows on large scales (1
Mpc and more) in the quasi-linear regime. If quasars randomly sample the
underlying galaxy distribution, the expected number of lines with $z_{abs}>z_Q$
per quasar can be as high as 0.25[(dN/dz)/350] at $z=2$, where $dN/dz$ is the
number of Lyman-alpha lines per unit redshift far from the quasar. The
probability is enhanced if quasars typically reside in small groups of
galaxies. A statistical excess of Lyman-alpha lines is expected near very dim
quasars or around metal absorption systems. Due to clustering, the standard
approach to the proximity effect overestimates the ionizing background flux at
high redshifts by up to a factor of 3. This result weakens the discrepancy
between the deduced background flux and the contribution from known populations
of quasars.

optically thin to pair production by photon-photon collisions in order to
produce the observed nonthermal spectra. We derive probability distributions
for the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum
baryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on
254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of
the bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the
curvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the
requirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently
small to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,
we discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight
bright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose
positional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity
function of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host

function increases. However, the allowed width of the GRB luminosity function
is restricted by the number-count statistics of the bursts.

disks. We show that gravitational lensing can therefore affect the statistics
of these systems. First, the magnification bias due to lensing raises faint
QSOs above a given magnitude threshold and thereby enhances the probability for
observing damped absorption systems. Second, the bending of light rays from the
source effectively limits the minimum impact parameter of the line-of-sight
relative to the center of the absorber, thus providing an upper cut-off to the
observed neutral hydrogen (HI) column density. The combination of these effects
yields a pronounced peak in the observed abundance of absorbers with high
column densities (>2*10^{21} cm^{-2}) and low redshifts (z<1). The inferred
value of the cosmological density parameter of neutral hydrogen, Omega_{HI},
increases with increasing redshift and luminosity of the sources even if the
true HI density remains constant. This trend resembles the observed evolution
of Omega_{HI}(z). Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers with column densities >10^{21}
cm^{-2} and redshifts 0.5<z<1 are reliable flags for lensed QSOs with a close
pair of images separated by 0.3 arcsec. Detection of these gravitational

isolated spherically symmetric density peaks starting from the linear
perturbative regime. The initial parameters correspond to density peaks of
various widths and heights in a Cold Dark Matter cosmology. We use a
one-dimensional spherical Lagrangian hydrodynamics code to follow the
dynamical, thermal, and non-equilibrium chemical evolution of the gas. The

composed of the nine species H, H^-, H^+, He, He^+, He^{++}, H_2, H_2^+, and
e^-. All relevant chemical reactions between these species and their cooling
mechanisms are included in the calculations. We find that radiative cooling by
H_2 affects the collapse dynamics of the gas only after it has already
virialized and become part of the bound object. Therefore, radiative cooling is
unlikely to have triggered the initial collapse of perturbations at redshifts
z>10. Nevertheless, objects with baryonic masses well below the linear-theory

anisotropy pattern, which can best be analyzed in Fourier domain. This allows
one to unambiguously distinguish cosmological signal of polarization from other
foregrounds and systematics, as well as from polarization induced by non-scalar
perturbations. The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation
power spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise and
foreground residuals. Choice of estimator can significantly improve our
capability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limit
the optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of two
compared to the simplest estimator. If foreground residuals are important then
a different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects from
foregrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. A particular
combination of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ parameters vanishes for scalar induced
polarization, thereby allowing an unambiguous determination of tensor modes.
Theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that one
typically expects a signal at the level of 5-10$\mu$K on small angular scales

to reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization,

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9610248v1,Gravitational Lensing of the X-Ray Background by Clusters of Galaxies,"  Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies affects the cosmic X-ray
background (XRB) by altering the observed density and flux distribution of
background X-ray sources. At faint detection flux thresholds, the resolved
X-ray sources appear brighter and diluted, while the unresolved component of
the XRB appears dimmer and more anisotropic, due to lensing. The diffuse X-ray
intensity in the outer halos of clusters might be lower than the sky-averaged
XRB, after the subtraction of resolved sources. Detection of the lensing signal
with a wide-field X-ray telescope could probe the mass distribution of a
cluster out to its virialization boundary. In particular, we show that the
lensing signature imprinted on the resolved component of the XRB by the cluster
A1689, should be difficult but possible to detect out to 8' at the 2-4 sigma
level, after 10^6 seconds of observation with the forthcoming AXAF satellite.
The lensing signal is fairly insensitive to the lens redshift in the range
0.1<z<0.6. The amplitude of the lensing signal is however sensitive to the
faint end slope of the number-flux relation for unresolved X-ray sources, and
can thus help constrain models of the XRB. A search for X-ray arcs or arclets
could identify the fraction of all faint sources which originate from extended
emission of distant galaxies. The probability for a 3 sigma detection of an
arclet which is stretched by a factor of about 3 after a 10^6 seconds
observation of A1689 with AXAF, is roughly comparable to the fraction of all

  J0045-7319 Binary","  Recent observations of PSR J0045-7319, a radio pulsar in a close eccentric
orbit with a massive B-star companion, indicate that the system's orbital
period is decreasing on a timescale of $\approx 5 \times10^{5}$ years, which is
much shorter than the timescale of $\approx$ 10^9 years given by the standard
theory of tidal dissipation in radiative stars. Observations also provide
strong evidence that the B-star is rotating rapidly, perhaps at nearly its
break up speed. We show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in a star
rotating in the same direction as the orbital motion of its companion (prograde
rotation) with a speed greater than the orbital angular speed of the star at
periastron results in an increase in the orbital period of the binary system
with time. Thus, since the observed time derivative of the orbital period is
large and negative, the B-star in the PSR J0045-7319 binary must have
retrograde rotation if tidal effects are to account for the orbital decay. We
also show that the time scale for the synchronization of the B-star's spin with
the orbital angular speed of the star at periastron is comparable to the
orbital evolution time. From the work of Goldreich and Nicholson (1989) we
therefore expect that the B-star should be rotating differentially, with the
outer layers rotating more slowly than the interior. We show that the
dissipation of the dynamical tide in such a differentially rotating B-star is
enhanced by almost three orders of magnitude leading to an orbital evolution
time for the PSR J0045-7319 Binary that is consistent with the observations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9611028v2,Signatures of Stellar Reionization of the Universe,"  The high ionization level and universal metallicity (1% solar) of the
intergalactic gas at redshifts z<5 implies that nonlinear structure had started
to form in the universe at earlier times than we currently probe. In Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) cosmologies, the first generation of baryonic objects emerges at
redshifts z=10-50. Here we examine the observable consequences of the
possibility that an early generation of stars reionized the universe and
resulted in the observed metallicity of the Lyman-alpha forest. Forthcoming
microwave anisotropy experiments will be sensitive to the damping of
anisotropies caused by scattering off free electrons from the reionization
epoch. For a large range of CDM models with a Scalo stellar mass function, we
find that reionization occurs at a redshift z>10 and damps the amplitude of
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees by a detectable amount, of order
10-25%. However, reionization is substantially delayed if the initial stellar
mass function transformed most of the baryons into low mass stars. In this
case, the mass fraction of pre-galactic stars could be constrained from the
statistics of microlensing events in galactic halos or along lines of sight to
quasars. Deep infrared imaging with future space telescopes (such as SIRTF or
the Next Generation Space Telescope) will be able to detect bright star

orbital period is decreasing on a timescale $\sim 5 x 10^{5}$ years (Kaspi et
al. 1996). Timing observations of PSR J0045-7319 also indicate that the B-star
is rotating rapidly, perhaps close to its breakup rotation rate. For rapid
(super-synchronous) prograde rotation of the B-star, tidal dissipation leads to
an increasing orbital period for the binary system, while for retrograde
rotation of any magnitude, the orbital period decreases with time. We show that
if tidal effects are to account for the observed orbital decay of the PSR
J0045-7319 binary, the B-star must have retrograde rotation. This implies that
the supernova that produced the pulsar in this binary system likely had a
dipole anisotropy.
  For a reasonably wide range of retrograde rotation rates, the energy in the
dynamical tide of the B-star needs to be dissipated in about one orbital period
in order to account for the observed orbital evolution time for the PSR

$\approx$ 10$^3$, regardless of the magnitude of the rotation rate. We describe
how, when the surface of the B-star is rotating nearly synchronously (which is
expected from the work of Goldreich and Nicholson, 1989), the energy in the
dynamical tide is dissipated in less than an orbital period, thus reconciling
the theoretical and observed rates of orbital evolution.

The microlensing signatures are stronger if the halo of the galaxy is made of

that the anomalous location of S1040 in the CMD is likely due to a prior

constraints on the amount of evolution in the baryonic content of galaxies and
on the value of the cosmological constant. The density of cold gas at redshifts
z=3+-1 is obtained from the mean HI column density of DLAs per cosmological
path length. This path length per unit redshift is in turn a sensitive function
of the vacuum density parameter, Omega_v. We compare the total inferred mass of
cold gas at high redshifts to that observed in stars today for flat
cosmologies. We define ""eta"" to be net fraction of the baryonic content of
local galaxies which was expelled since z=3, and use Bayesian inference to
derive confidence regions in the (eta, Omega_v) plane. In all cosmologies we
find that eta<0.4 with at least 95% confidence if <25% of the current stellar
population formed before z=3. The most likely value of eta is negative,
implying a net increase by several tens of percent in the baryonic mass of
galaxies since z=3+-1. On the other hand, recent observations of high metal
abundances in the intracluster medium of rich clusters (Loewenstein & Mushotzky
1996) require that metal-rich gas be expelled from galaxies in an amount
approximately equal to the current mass in stars. Based on our results and the
low metallicity observed in DLAs at z>2, we infer that more than half of the
baryonic mass processed through galaxies must have been assembled and partly
expelled from galaxies after z=2. We expect our constraints to improve
considerably as the size of the DLA sample will increase with the forthcoming

cosmic-variance limit to detecting a small tensor signal with only a
temperature map. Here we assess the detectability of a gravity-wave background
with a temperature and polarization map. For detector sensitivities better than
$10-20 \mu K \sqrt{sec}$, the sensitivity to a tensor signal is always
dominated by the polarization map. With a detector sensitivity of order $1 \mu
K \sqrt{sec}$, polarization could improve on a temperature-map sensitivity to
tensor modes by two to three orders of magnitude. Even a small amount of
reionization substantially enhances tensor-mode detectability. We also argue
that the sensitivity of the Planck Surveyor to tensor modes is significantly
improved with polarization, even taking into account the resulting degradation
of the intensity determination in the high-frequency channels.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9706100v1,Energy Spectra and High Frequency Oscillations in 4U 0614+091,"  We investigate the behavior of the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) in 4U 0614+091, combining timing and spectral analysis of RXTE
observations. The energy spectra of the source can be described by a power law
(alpha ~ 2.8) and a blackbody (kT ~ 1.5), with the blackbody accounting for 10
- 20% of the total energy flux. We find a robust correlation of the frequency,
nu, of the higher frequency QPO near 1 kHz with the flux of the blackbody,
F_BB. The slope of this correlation, dlog(nu)/dlog(F_BB), is 0.27 to 0.37. The
source follows the same relation even in observations separated by several
months. The QPO frequency does not have a similarly unique correlation with the
total flux or the flux of the power law component. The RMS fraction of the
higher frequency QPO rises with energy from 6.8 +- 1.5 % (3-5 keV) to 21.3 +-
4.0 % (10-12 keV). For the lower frequency QPO, however, it is consistent with
a constant value of 5.4 +- 0.9 %. The results may be interpreted in terms of a
beat frequency model for the production of the high frequency QPOs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9707039v1,Scintillation-Induced Intermittency in SETI,"  We consider interstellar scintillations as a cause of intermittency in radio
signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). We demonstrate that
scintillations are very likely to allow initial detections of narrowband
signals from distant sources (> 100 pc), while making redetections improbable.
We consider three models in order to assess the non-repeating, narrowband
events found in recent SETI and to analyze large surveys in general: (I)
Radiometer noise; (II) A population of constant Galactic sources undergoing
interstellar scintillation,; and (III) Real, transient signals (or hardware
errors) of either terrestrial or ET origin.
  We apply likelihood and Bayesian tests of the models to The Planetary
Society/Harvard META data. We find that Models II and III are both highly
preferred to Model I, but that Models II and III are about equally likely.
Ruling out Model II in favor of Model III requires many more reobservations
than were conducted in META *or* the reobservation threshold must be much lower
than was used in META. *We cannot rule out the possibility that META events are
real, intrinsically steady ETI signals.*
  We recommend that future surveys use thresholds far below the typical
false-alarm threshold to lessen the effects of intermittency. The threshold
level is best defined in terms of the recording and computational technology
that is available at a cost commensurate with other survey costs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710208v1,Observational Signatures of the First Quasars,"  We study the observational signatures of a potential population of
low-luminosity quasars at high redshifts in a LambdaCDM cosmology. We derive
the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at fainter luminosities and
higher redshifts than currently detected, based on three assumptions: (1) the
formation of dark-matter halos follows the Press-Schechter theory, (2) the
ratio of central black hole mass to halo mass is the same for all halos, and
(3) the light-curve of quasars, in Eddington units, is universal. We show that
a universal light-curve provides an excellent fit to the observed quasar
luminosity function at redshifts 2.6 < z < 4.5. By extrapolating the evolution
of this luminosity function to higher redshifts (4.5 < z < 20), we find that
the associated early population of low-luminosity quasars reionizes the
universe around redshift z=12. The reprocessing of the UV light of these
quasars by dust from early type II supernovae, distorts the microwave
background spectrum by a Compton y-parameter, y = 1e-5, comparable to the upper
limit set by COBE. The Next Generation Space Telescope could detect tens of
quasars from redshifts z > 10 per square arcminute, with its proposed 1nJy
sensitivity at 1-3.5 microns. Absorption spectra of several such quasars would
reveal the reionization history of the universe.

could be accommodated in beat-frequency models such as proposed for the kHz
QPOs. We measured the rms fractional amplitude of both QPOs as a function of
energy, and we found that the relation is steeper for the lower than for the
upper frequency peak. This is the first source where such difference between

  Our evolution code simulates planetesimal growth in a single annulus and
includes velocity evolution but not fragmentation. Test results match analytic
solutions and duplicate previous simulations at 1 AU.
  In the Kuiper Belt, simulations without velocity evolution produce a single
runaway body with a radius of 1000 km on a time scale inversely proportional to
the initial mass in the annulus. Runaway growth occurs in 100 Myr for 10 earth
masses and an initial eccentricity of 0.001 in a 6 AU annulus centered at 35
AU. This mass is close to the amount of dusty material expected in a minimum
mass solar nebula extrapolated into the Kuiper Belt.
  Simulations with velocity evolution produce runaway growth on a wide range of
time scales. Dynamical friction and viscous stirring increase particle
velocities in models with large (8 km radius) initial bodies. This velocity
increase delays runaway growth by a factor of two compared to models without
velocity evolution. In contrast, collisional damping dominates over dynamical
friction and viscous stirring in models with small (80--800 m radius) initial
bodies. Collisional damping decreases the time scale to runaway growth by
factors of 4--10 relative to constant velocity calculations. Simulations with
minimum mass solar nebulae, 10 earth masses, reach runaway growth on time
scales of 20-40 Myr with 80 m initial bodies, 50-100 Myr with 800 m bodies, and
75-250 Myr for 8 km initial bodies. These growth times vary linearly with the
mass of the annulus but are less sensitive to the initial eccentricity than
constant velocity models.

from the most powerful explosions in the Universe. If GRBs are not beamed then
the distribution of their number as a function of Gamma-ray flux implies that
they occur once per (0.3-40) million years per bright galaxy and that they
deposit >10^{53} ergs into their surrounding interstellar medium. The blast
wave generated by a GRB explosion would be washed out by interstellar
turbulence only after tens of millions of years when it finally slows down to a
velocity of 10 km/s. This rather long lifetime implies that there could be up
to several tens of active GRB remnants in each galaxy at any given time. For
many years, radio observations have revealed the enigmatic presence of
expanding neutral-hydrogen (HI) supershells of kpc radius in the Milky Way and
in other nearby galaxies. The properties of some supershells cannot be easily
explained in terms of conventional sources such as stellar winds or supernova
explosions. However, the inferred energy and frequency of the explosions
required to produce most of the observed supershells agree with the above GRB
parameters. More careful observations and analysis might reveal which fraction
of these supershells are GRB remnants. We show that if this link is
established, the data on HI supershells can be used to constrain the energy
output, the rate per galaxy, the beaming factor, and the environment of GRB
sources in the Universe.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9809103v1,"Measuring the Virial Temperature of Galactic Halos Through Electron
  Scattering of Quasar Emission Lines","  Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation postulate the existence of
virialized gaseous halos around galaxies at high redshifts. A small fraction of
the light emitted by any high-redshift quasar is therefore expected to scatter
off the free electrons in the halo of its host galaxy. The broadening of the
scattered emission lines of the quasar can be used to measure the temperature
of these electrons. For gas in virial equilibrium, the velocity width of the
scattered line profile is larger by a factor of (m_p/m_e)^{1/2}=43 than the
velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and reaches >10,000 km/s for the massive
galaxies and groups in which bright quasars reside. In these systems, the
scattered width exceeds the intrinsic width of the quasar lines and hence can
be used to measure the virial temperature of the quasar host. The high degree
of polarization of the scattered radiation can help filter out the extended
scattered light from the central emission by the quasar and its host galaxy.
The signal-to-noise ratio of the spectral broadening can be enhanced by
matching the full spectrum of the scattered radiation to a template of the
unscattered quasar spectrum. Although the central fuzz around low-redshift
quasars is dominated by starlight, the fuzz around high-redshift quasars might
be dominated by scattering before galaxies have converted most of their gas
reservoirs into stars.

constructed from U, B, V, and I data obtained with the HST/WFPC2 reveal seven

We suggest that they could be low-mass helium white dwarfs, formed when the

We show that photoionization of this gas by the fresh cosmic UV background

calculate the photoionization heating of gas inside spherically symmetric dark
matter halos, and assume that gas which is heated above its virial temperature
is expelled. In popular Cold Dark Matter models, the Press-Schechter halo
abundance implies that about 50-90% of the collapsed gas was evaporated at
reionization. The gas originated from halos below a threshold circular velocity
of 10-15 km/s. The resulting outflows from the dwarf galaxy population at
redshifts 5-10 affected the metallicity, thermal and hydrodynamic state of the
surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results suggest that stellar systems with
a velocity dispersion below about 10 km/s, such as globular clusters or the

cosmological collapse at high redshifts.

strongly absorbed shortward of their rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength by
neutral hydrogen (HI) in the intervening intergalactic medium. However, the
Lyman-alpha line photons emitted by these sources are not eliminated but rather
scatter until they redshift out of resonance and escape due to the Hubble
expansion of the surrounding intergalactic HI. We calculate the resulting
brightness distribution and the spectral shape of the diffuse Lyman-alpha line
emission around high redshift sources, before the intergalactic medium was
reionized. Typically, the Lyman-alpha photons emitted by a source at z=10
scatter over a characteristic angular radius of order 15 arcseconds around the
source and compose a line which is broadened and redshifted by about a thousand
km/s relative to the source. The scattered photons are highly polarized.
Detection of the diffuse Lyman-alpha halos around high redshift sources would
provide a unique tool for probing the neutral intergalactic medium before the
epoch of reionization. On sufficiently large scales where the Hubble flow is
smooth and the gas is neutral, the Lyman-alpha brightness distribution can be
used to determine the cosmological mass densities of baryons and matter.

other turbulent inputs. The structures which form reproduce well observed

gravitationally-bound structures by turbulent compression are summarized. For
flows with equations of state $P\propto \rho^\gamma$, the statistics of the

forced and decaying MHD compressible turbulence have shown that the decay rate
is comparable to the non-magnetic case. For virialized clouds, the turbulent
decay time is shorter than the gravitational free-fall time, so wholesale cloud
collapse is only prevented by ongoing turbulent inputs and/or a strong mean

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9903384v2,Constraints on the magnitude of alpha in dynamo theory,"  We consider the backreaction of the magnetic field on the magnetic dynamo
coefficients and the role of boundary conditions in interpreting whether
numerical evidence for suppression is dynamical. If a uniform field in a
periodic box serves as the initial condition for modeling the backreaction on
the turbulent EMF, then the magnitude of the turbulent EMF and thus the dynamo
coefficient $\a$, have a stringent upper limit that depends on the magnetic
Reynolds number $R_M$ to a power of order -1. This is not a dynamic suppression
but results just because of the imposed boundary conditions. In contrast, when
mean field gradients are allowed within the simulation region, or non-periodic
boundary are used, the upper limit is independent of $R_M$ and takes its
kinematic value. Thus only for simulations of the latter types could a measured
suppression be the result of a dynamic backreaction. This is fundamental for
understanding a long-standing controversy surrounding $\alpha$ suppression.
Numerical simulations which do not allow any field gradients and invoke
periodic boundary conditions appear to show a strong $\alpha$ suppression (e.g.
Cattaneo & Hughes 1996). Simulations of accretion discs which allow field
gradients and allow free boundary conditions (Brandenburg & Donner 1997)
suggest a dynamo $\alpha$ which is not suppressed by a power of $R_M$. Our

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9904319v3,Intergalactic Dust and Observations of Type Ia Supernovae,"  Estimates of the cosmic star formation rate and of cluster metallicities
independently imply that at z < 0.5 the gas in the universe has substantial
average metallicity: 1/10 < Z/Z_solar < 1/3 for Omega_gas = 0.05. This metal
density probably cannot be contained in known solar-metallicity galaxies of
density parameter Omega_star ~ 0.004, implying significant enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) by ejection of metals and dust from galaxies via
winds, in mergers or in dust efflux driven by radiation pressure. Galaxies have
a dust/metal ratio of ~ 0.5 in their interstellar media, but some fraction
(1-f) > 0 of this must be destroyed in the IGM or during the ejection process.
Assuming the Draine & Lee dust model and preferential destruction of small
grains, I calculate the reddening and extinction of a uniform cosmological dust
component in terms of (f) and the minimum grain size a_min. Very small grains
provide most of the reddening but less than half of the opacity for optical
extinction. For f > 0.3 and a_min > 0.1 microns, the intergalactic dust would
be too grey to have been detected by its reddening, yet dense enough to be
cosmologically important: it could account for the recently observed type Ia
supernova dimming at z ~ 0.5 without cosmic acceleration. The importance of
grey intergalactic dust of the described type can be tested by observations of
z=0.5 supernovae in (rest) R-band or longer wavelengths and by the fluxes of a
large sample of supernovae at z > 1. (Abridged)

  small-planetary-mass objects as the dominant inner-halo galactic dark matter","  We examine recent results of two kinds of microlensing experiments intended
to detect galactic dark matter objects, and we suggest that the lack of short
period star-microlensing events observed for stars near the Galaxy does not
preclude either the ``rogue planets'' identified from quasar-microlensing by
Schild 1996 as the missing-mass of a lens galaxy, or the clumps of such objects
predicted by the new Gibson 1996-2000 hydro-gravitational theory as the
inner-halo galactic dark matter. We point out that such micro-brown-dwarfs in
nonlinear accretional cascades to form stars give intermittent lognormal number
density n_p distributions. Hence, star-microlensing searches that focus on a
small fraction of the sky and assume a uniform distribution for n_p are subject
to undersampling errors. Sparse independent samples give modes smaller than
means of the highly skewed lognormal distributions expected.
Quasar-microlensing searches with higher optical depths are less affected by
intermittency. We attempt to reconcile the results of the star-microlensing and
quasar-microlensing studies. We conclude that star microlensing searches cannot
exclude and are unlikely to even detect these objects so easily observed by
quasar-microlensing and so robustly predicted by the new theory.

NGC4051 was observed in an unusual low flux state by BeppoSAX (Guainazzi et al.
1998) RXTE and EUVE. We present fits of the 4-15 keV RXTE spectrum and BeppoSAX
MECS spectrum obtained during this observation, which are consistent with the
interpretation that the source had switched off, leaving only the spectrum of
pure reflection from distant cold matter. We place this result in context by
showing the X-ray lightcurve of NGC4051 obtained by our RXTE monitoring
campaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low state
lasted for ~150 days before the May observations (implying that the reflecting
material is > 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of a
lightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux over
timescales > months. We show that the long-timescale component to X-ray
variability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct from
the variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations in
the accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. As the source
approaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. NGC4051
may represent a microcosm of all X-ray variability in radio quiet active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), displaying in a few years a variety of flux states and
variability properties which more luminous AGNs may pass through on timescales
of decades to thousands of years.

point-mass microlensing to small spots with radii $r_s\lesssim0.2$ source

spotless source and explore its dependence on lensing and spot parameters.
During source-transit events spots can cause deviations larger than 2%, and
thus be in principle detectable. Maximum relative deviation usually occurs when
the lens directly crosses the spot. Its numerical value for a dark spot with
sufficient contrast is found to be roughly equal to the fractional radius of
the spot, i.e., up to 20% in this study. Spots can also be efficiently detected
by the changes in sensitive spectral lines during the event. Notably, the
presence of a spot can mimic the effect of a low-mass companion of the lens in
some events.

universe with Omega_Lambda=0 and the presence of > 0.1 micron dust grains with
a mass density of Omega_dust ~ (few) * 10^{-5} in the intergalactic (IG)

would be marginally consistent with the present unresolved fraction of the

resolve the FIRB to a flux limit of ~0.5 mJy, along with a more precise measure

we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes for
the formation of the Galaxy and which proved to be successful in reproducing
the majority of the observational constraints, at least for the case of a
constant IMF. Different variable IMFs are tested with this model, all assuming
that massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity.
This implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and at
large galactocentric distances. Our numerical results have shown that all the
variable IMFs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevant
observational constraints in the Galaxy and that a constant IMF still
reproduces better the observations. In particular, variable IMFs of the kind
explored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients even
when allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as, for
instance, the star formation rate. As a consequence of this we conclude that
the G-dwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large
timescale and a constant IMF, since it is possible to find variable IMFs of the
kind studied here, reproducing the G-dwarf metallicity but this worsen the
agreement with other observational constraints.

empirical calibrations of extinction curves, but rather on the lifetime of
molecular clouds which delays the emergence of each successive generation of
stars at ultraviolet wavelengths by typically 15 Myr. The predicted rest-frame
far-infrared to millimeter-wave emission includes the calculation of molecular
emission-line luminosities ($^{12}$CO and O$_{2}$ among other molecules)
consistent with the evolving chemical abundances. Here we present details of
this new model, along with the results of comparing its predictions with
several high-redshift observables, namely: the ultraviolet SEDs of Lyman-limit

that most Lyman-limit galaxies should have a value of $\alpha$ inside that

a sun-like star - confirmed that it is a gas giant and determined that its
orbital inclination is 85 degrees. This inclination makes possible
investigations of the planet atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the planet
transmission spectra during a transit. The basic tenet of the method is that
the planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar
flux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb.
The ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is
small, approximately 10^{-3} to 10^{-4}; for this method to work very strong
planet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in
extrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the
alkali metal lines, in particular the Na I and K I resonance doublets, and the
He I $2^3S$ - $2^3P$ triplet line at 1083.0 nm. If successful, observations
will constrain the line-of-sight temperature, pressure, and density. The most
important point is that observations will constrain the cloud depth, which in
turn will distinguish between different atmosphere models. We also discuss the

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001477v1,"The Elliptical Galaxy formerly known as the Local Group: Merging the
  Globular Cluster Systems","  Prompted by a new catalogue of M31 globular clusters, we have collected
together individual metallicity values for globular clusters in the Local
Group. Although we briefly describe the globular cluster systems of the
individual Local Group galaxies, the main thrust of our paper is to examine the
collective properties. In this way we are simulating the dissipationless merger
of the Local Group, into presumably an elliptical galaxy. Such a merger is
dominated by the Milky Way and M31, which appear to be fairly typical examples
of globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies.
  The Local Group `Elliptical' has about 700 +/- 125 globular clusters, with a
luminosity function resembling the `universal' one. The metallicity
distribution has peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -1.55 and -0.64 with a metal-poor to
metal-rich ratio of 2.5:1. The specific frequency of the Local Group Elliptical
is initially about 1 but rises to about 3, when the young stellar populations
fade and the galaxy resembles an old elliptical. The metallicity distribution
and stellar population corrected specific frequency are similar to that of some
known early type galaxies. Based on our results, we briefly speculate on the
origin of globular cluster systems in galaxies.

about 800 years, the physical motions of the masers have been directly measured
with VLBI over a period of a few years. These measurements also allow the
distance from the earth to the black hole to be estimated to an accuracy of 4
percent. The status of the search for other maser/black hole candidates is also

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002135v1,The Formation and Fragmentation of Primordial Molecular Clouds,"  Many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of the
intergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to be
intimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. In
particular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial IMF
are of special interest. We present results from high resolution
three--dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the
collapse of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation
within a cosmologically representative volume. Comoving scales from 128 kpc
down to 1 pc are followed accurately. Dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and
all relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followed
self-consistently for a cluster normalized CDM structure formation model.
Primordial molecular clouds with ~10^5 solar masses are assembled by mergers of
multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with a
fractional abundance of ~10^-4. As the subclumps merge cooling lowers the
temperature to ~200 Kelvin in a `cold pocket' at the center of the halo. Within
this cold pocket, a quasi-hydrostatically contracting core with ~200 solar mass
and number densities > 10^5 cm^-3 is found. We find that less than 1% of the
primordial gas in such small scale structures cools and collapses to
sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star formation.
Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that this study achieved the highest
dynamic range covered by structured adaptive mesh techniques in cosmological
hydrodynamics to date.

  galaxies","  The radio emission from supermassive black holes in nearby early-type
galaxies can be used to test possible explanations for their low luminosities.
We calculate the expected contribution from thermal synchrotron emission from
hot accretion flows to the high radio frequency observations of NGC 2300, NGC
1399, NGC 4278 and NGC 4594. We find that, in all cases, and in accordance with
our previous findings, hot flows accreting close to their Bondi rates
overestimate significantly the observed fluxes. This implies that simply
assuming a low radiative efficiency for the accreting gas is not enough to
explain their low luminosities. Smaller central densities and accretion rates,
as expected in the presence of strong mass loss or convection in the flows, can
help reconcile the models with observations. We also show that a significant
contribution to the high-frequency radio spectra can be due to non-thermal
synchrotron emission from the small scale radio jets observed in these systems,
allowing for even lower accretion rates in the inflows. We suggest that these
outflows or jets may dump significant energy into the surronding medium close
to the accretion radius and so reduce the accretion rates onto these systems.
We discuss the relationship between the radio flux and black hole mass for the
observed sample and its potential importance for probing accretion models.

percent level. The variability in radio-quiet quasars confirms that the radio

variabilities (up to 300% peak-to-peak) in a sample of nearby low-luminosity

could be related to the activity of nuclear jets responding to changing

(SCF) introduced by Rosolowsky et al. 1999 are studied using observational
data, numerical simulations of magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, and simple
models of Gaussian spectral line profiles. The most significant innovations of
this paper are: i) the normalization of the SCF based on an analytic model for
the effect of noise; ii) the computation of the SCF as a function of the
spatial lag between spectra within a map. By computing of the dependence of the
SCF on the spatial lag, S_o(dr), we have been able to conclude that: 1) S_o(dr)
is a power law, with slope in the range of scales l_i-l_o. 2) The correlation
outer scale, l_o, is determined by the size of the map, and no evidence for a
true departure from self-similarity on large scales has been found. 3) The
correlation inner scale, l_i, is a true estimate of the smallest self-similar
scale in a map. 4) The spectral slope in a given region, is independent of
velocity resolution (above a minimum resolution threshold), spatial resolution,
and average spectrum quality. 5) Molecular transitions which trace higher gas
density yield larger values of the spectral slope than transitions tracing
lower gas density. 6) Nyquist sampling, bad pixels in detector arrays, and
reference sharing data acquisition need to be taken into account for a correct
determination of the SCF at lag dr=1. The value of the spectral slope, however,
can be computed correctly without a detailed knowledge of observational
procedures.

is probably an eclipsing blue straggler, or (less likely) the infrared
counterpart to the low mass X-ray binary known in Terzan 5. Due to the extreme

two-temperature accretion flow onto a neutron star or any other compact star
with a surface. We assume Coulomb coupling between the protons and electrons,
and free-free cooling from the electrons. Outside a thin boundary layer, where
the accretion flow meets the star, we show that there is an extended settling
region which is well-described by two self-similar solutions: (1) a
two-temperature solution which is valid in an inner zone $r\le10^{2.5}$ ($r$ is
in Schwarzchild units), and (2) a one-temperature solution at larger radii. In
both zones, $\rho\propto r^{-2}, \Omega\propto r^{-3/2}, v\propto r^0,\
T_p\propto r^{-1}$; in the two-temperature zone, $T_e\propto r^{-1/2}$. The
luminosity of the settling zone arises from the rotational energy of the star
as the star is braked by viscosity; hence the luminosity is independent of
$\dot M$. The settling solution is convectively and viscously stable and is
unlikely to have strong winds or outflows. The flow is thermally unstable, but
the instability may be stabilized by thermal conduction. The settling solution
described here is not advection-dominated, and is thus different from the
self-similar ADAF found around black holes. When the spin of the star is small
enough, however, the present solution transforms smoothly to a (settling) ADAF.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102447v1,"The Effects of Metallicity on the Cepheid P-L Relation and the
  Consequences for the Extragalactic Distance Scale","  Using published HST Cepheid data from 25 galaxies, we have found a
correlation between the P-L dispersion and host galaxy metallicity which is
significant at the ~3sigma level in the V band. This result supports the
suggestion that the metallicity dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation may be
stronger than expected. The high observed dispersions in the HST Cepheid P-L
relations have the further consequence that the bias due to incompleteness in
the P-L relation at faint magnitudes is more significant than previously
thought. In the HST sample, galaxies at higher distance tend to have higher
metallicity. This means that when a full metallicity/incompleteness correction
is made, a scale error in the published Cepheid distances is seen in the sense
that the published distance moduli are increasingly underestimates at larger
distances. This results in the average distance modulus to the four galaxies in
the Virgo cluster core increasing from (m-M)_0=31.2+-0.19 to (m-M)_0=31.8+-0.17
with similar increases for the Fornax and Ursa Major clusters. For the 18 HST
galaxies with good Tully-Fisher distances and (m-M)_0>29.5 the Cepheid-TF
distance modulus average residual increases from 0.44+-0.09 mag to 0.82+-0.1mag
indicating a significant scale error in TF distances and resulting in the
previous Pierce & Tully TF estimate of H_0=85 reducing to H_0=58+-7. Finally,
for the 8 HST galaxies with SNIa, the metallicity corrected Cepheid distances
now imply a metallicity dependence of SNIa peak luminosity in the sense that

G) neutron-star atmospheres taking into account magnetic free-free absorption
and scattering processes computed for two polarization modes. We include the
effects of vacuum polarization in our calculations. We present temperature
profiles and the angle-, photon energy-, and polarization-dependent emerging
intensity for a range of magnetic field strengths and effective temperatures of
the atmospheres. We find that for B < 10^14 G, the emerging spectra are bluer
than the blackbody corresponding to the effective temperature, T_eff, with
modified Planckian shapes due to the photon-energy dependence of the magnetic
opacities. However, vacuum polarization significantly modifies the spectra for
B~10^15 G, giving rise to power-law tails at high photon energies. The
angle-dependence (beaming) of the emerging intensity has two maxima: a narrow
(pencil) peak at small angles (<5 degrees) with respect to the normal and a
broad maximum (fan beam) at intermediate angles (~20-60 degrees). The relative
importance and the opening angle of the radial beam decreases strongly with
increasing magnetic field strength and decreasing photon energy. We finally
compute a T_eff-T_c relation for our models, where T_c is the local color
temperature of the spectrum emerging from the neutron star surface, and find
that T_c/T_eff ranges between 1.1-1.8. We discuss the implications of our
results for various thermally emitting neutron star models.

  the Magnetar Model","  The energy source powering the X-ray emission from anomalous X-ray pulsars

the presence of an ultramagnetized neutron star, or ``magnetar'', with B on the

have analyzed archival ASCA data for several known AXPs and SGRs, and fitted
them with a model in which all or part of the X-ray flux originates as thermal
emission from a magnetar. Our magnetar spectral model includes the effects of
the anisotropy of the heat flow through an ultramagnetized neutron star
envelope, reprocessing by a light element atmosphere, and general relativistic
corrections to the observed spectrum. We obtain good fits to the data with
radii for the emitting areas which are generally consistent with those expected
for neutron stars, in contrast to blackbody (BB) fits, which imply much smaller
radii. Furthermore, the inclusion of atmospheric effects results in inferred
temperatures which are lower than those implied by BB fits, but however still
too high to be accounted by thermal cooling alone. An extra source of heating
(possibly due to magnetic field decay) is needed. Despite the harder tail in
the spectrum produced by reprocessing of the outgoing flux through the
atmosphere, spectral fits still require a considerable fraction of the flux to
be in a power-law component.

  and Stability","  We present analytical and numerical solutions which describe a hot, viscous,
two-temperature accretion flow onto a rotating neutron star or any other
rotating compact star with a surface. We assume Coulomb coupling between the
protons and electrons, and free-free cooling from the electrons. Outside a thin
boundary layer, where the accretion flow meets the star, we show that there is
an extended settling region which is well-described by two self-similar
solutions: (i) a two-temperature solution which is valid in an inner zone
$r\le10^{2.5}$ ($r$ is in Schwarzchild units), and (ii) a one-temperature
solution at larger radii. In both zones, $\rho\propto r^{-2}, \Omega\propto
r^{-3/2}, v\propto r^0, T_p\propto r^{-1}$; in the two-temperature zone,
$T_e\propto r^{-1/2}$. The luminosity of the settling zone arises from the
rotational energy of the star as the star is braked by viscosity. Hence the
luminosity and the flow parameters (density, temperature, angular velocity) are
independent of $\dot M$. The settling solution described here is not
advection-dominated, and is thus different from the self-similar ADAF found
around black holes. When the spin of the star is small enough, however, the
present solution transforms smoothly to a (settling) ADAF.
  We carried out a stability analysis of the settling flow. The flow is
convectively and viscously stable and is unlikely to have strong winds or
outflows. Unlike another cooling-dominated system --- the SLE disk, --- the
settling flow is thermally stable provided that thermal conduction is taken
into account. This strong saturated-like thermoconduction does not change the
structure of the flow.

this deviation was well-fit by an ad hoc model in which a thin ring of emission
is microlensed by an intervening star. We revisit the microlensing
interpretation of this variability, first by testing whether microlensing of
afterglow images with realistic surface brightness profiles (SBPs) can fit the

non-parametric measurement of the SBP. We find that microlensing of realistic
SBPs can reproduce the observed deviation, provided that the optical emission
arises from frequencies above the cooling break. Conversely, if the variability
is indeed caused by microlensing, the SBP must be significantly
limb-brightened. Specifically, greater than 60% of the flux must originate from
the outer 25% of the area of the afterglow image. The latter requirement is
satisfied by the best fit theoretical SBP. The underlying optical/infrared
afterglow lightcurve is consistent with a model in which a jet is propagating

stars can be inferred from their gravitational microlensing effect on GRB
afterglows. Prior to reionization, quasars should be surrounded by a halo of
scattered Lyman-alpha radiation which probes the neutral intergalactic medium

scattered light around a street lamp which is embedded in a dense fog. Outflows
from quasars magnetize the IGM at all redshifts. As a result, the shocks
produced by converging flows during the formation of large scale structure in
the IGM, accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and become visible in
the radio regime through their synchrotron emission and in the gamma-ray regime
through their inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background photons.

halos is also used routinely in semi-analytic modeling of the formation of disk

reasonable agreement with high resolution cosmological smoothed particle
hydrodynamical simulations that follow the dark matter as long as only
adiabatic gas physics are included. However, we argue that in more realistic

uncorrelated and their respective angular momenta are not expected to align. An

with a small pencil and a broad fan component. We show that the combination of
this radiation pattern with the effects of strong lensing in the gravitational
field of the neutron star yields pulse profiles that show a qualitatively
different behavior compared to that of the radially-peaked beaming patterns
explored previously. Specifically, we find that: (i) the pulse profiles of
magnetars with a single hot emission region on their surface exhibit 1-2 peaks,
whereas those with an antipodal emission geometry have 1-4 peaks, depending on
the neutron star compactness, the observer's viewing angle, and the size of the
hot regions; (ii) the energy dependence of the beaming pattern may give rise to
weakly or strongly energy-dependent pulse profiles and may introduce phase lags
between different energy bands; (iii) the non-radial beaming pattern can give
rise to high pulsed fractions even for very relativistic neutron stars; (iv)
the pulsed fraction may not vary monotonically with neutron star compactness;
(v) the pulsed fraction does not decrease monotonically with the size of the
emitting region; (vi) the pulsed fraction from a neutron star with a single hot
pole has, in general, a very weak energy dependence, in contrast to the case of
an antipodal geometry. Comparison of these results to the observed properties

directly model the Poisson nature of the data and thus are expected to exhibit
improved sampling properties. Our model also accounts for the Poisson nature of
background contamination of the observations, image blurring due to instrument
response, and the absorption of photons in space. The resulting highly

summarize the relative frequency of the energy of photons (X-ray or gamma-ray)
arriving at a detector. Independent Poisson distributions are more appropriate
to model the counts than the commonly used normal approximation. We model the
high energy tail of the ASCA spectrum of each of the stars as a combination of
a Bremsstrahlung continuum and ten narrow emission lines, included at positions
of known strong lines. Statistical analysis is based on two source observations
and one background observation. We use sequential Bayesian analysis for the two

to construct a prior for the second. Sensitivity of the final results to the

intrinsic linewidth of the gas exceeds one half of the separation of these

observed linewidths greatly overestimate the intrinsic linewidths. If
uncorrected, these artificially broad linewidths will lead to artificially high
opacities. We have observed this effect in our NH3 data from the central 10 pc

models for younger MSPs and may suggest the surface magnetic field has been
modified by repeated accretion episodes to include multipole components.
Correlating HST images, radio timing positions, and the Chandra dataset has
allowed optical searches for MSP binary companions. The MSP 47 Tuc-U is
coincident with a blue star exhibiting sinusoidal variations that agree in
period and phase with the heated face of the WD companion. Another blue
variable star (and X-ray source) agrees in period and phase with the companion
to 47 Tuc-W (which lacks an accurate timing position); this companion is
probably a main sequence star.

  Distributions and Optical Opacities","  The interaction of a radiation field with a dusty medium is a relevant issue
in several astrophysical contexts. We use the time-dependent photoionization
code in a dusty medium developed by Perna & Lazzati (2002), to study the
modifications in the dust distribution and the relative optical opacities when
a strong X-ray UV radiation flux propagates into a medium. We find that
silicates are preferentially destroyed with respect to graphite, and the
extinction curve becomes significantly flatter (hence implying less reddening),
with the characteristic bump at lambda 2175 A highly suppressed, due to the
destruction of the small graphite grains. This could explain the observational
lack of such a feature in GRB afterglow and AGN spectra. For a very intense and
highly variable source irradiating a compact and dense region, time variability
in the optical opacity resulting from dust destruction can be observed on a
relatively short timescale. We show that, under these circumstances, monitoring
the time variability of the opacity can yield powerful clues on the properties
of dust in the environment of the source. In particular, it allows to break the
observational degeneracy as to whether a grey extinction is the result of a low
dust-to-gas ratio or of a dust grain distribution that is skewed towards large
grains.

fluid around a Kerr black hole is investigated. We focus on the plunging region
between the black hole horizon and the marginally stable circular orbit in the
equatorial plane. Adopting the kinematic approximation where the dynamical
effects of magnetic fields are ignored, we exactly solve Maxwell's equations
with the assumptions that the geodesic motion of the fluid is stationary and
axisymmetric, the magnetic field has only radial and azimuthal components and
depends only on time and radial coordinates. We show that the stationary state
of the magnetic field in the plunging region is uniquely determined by the
boundary conditions at the marginally stable circular orbit. If the magnetic
field at the marginally stable circular orbit is in a stationary state, the
magnetic field in the plunging region will quickly settle into a stationary
state if it is not so initially, in a time determined by the dynamical time
scale. The radial component of the magnetic field at the marginally stable
circular orbit is more important than the toroidal component in determining the
structure and evolution of the magnetic field in the plunging region. Even if
at the marginally stable circular orbit the toroidal component is zero, in the
plunging region a toroidal component is quickly generated from the radial
component by the shear motion of the fluid. Finally, we show that the dynamical
effects of magnetic fields are unimportant in the plunging region if they are
negligible on the marginally stable circular orbit. This supports the
``no-torque inner boundary condition'' of thin disks, contrary to the claim in

a series of GRB Hubble diagrams, that the current sample cannot place
meaningful constraints upon the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Indeed
for GRBs to ever be useful in cosmographic measurements we argue the necessity
of two directions. First, GRB Hubble diagrams should be based upon fundamental
physical quantities such as energy, rather than empirically-derived and
physically ill-understood distance indicators. Second, a more homogeneous set
should be constructed by culling sub-classes from the larger sample. These
sub-classes, though now first recognizable by deviant energies, ultimately must
be identifiable by properties other than those directly related to energy. We
identify a new sub-class of GRBs (``f-GRBs'') which appear both underluminous

one hope is that with a uniformly-selected sample, the large-scale redshift
distribution of GRBs can help constrain the star-formation history of the
Universe. However, we show that strong observational biases in ground-based
redshift discovery hamper a clean determination of the large-scale GRB rate and
hence the connection of GRBs to the star formation history. We then focus on
the properties of the small-scale (clustering) distribution of GRB redshifts.
When corrected for heliocentric motion relative to the local Hubble flow, the
observed redshifts appear to show a propensity for clustering: 8 of 26 GRBs
occurred within a recession velocity difference of 1000 km/s of another GRB.
That is, 4 pairs of GRBs occurred within 30 h_65^-1 Myr in cosmic time, despite

being low (the cut-sky quadrupole measured by the WMAP team is more strikingly
low, apparently due to a coincidence in the orientation of our Galaxy of no
cosmological significance);
  2. The cosmic octopole on its own is anomalous at the 1-in-20 level by being
very planar;
  3. The alignment between the quadrupole and octopole is anomalous at the
1-in-60 level.
  Although the a priori chance of all three occurring is 1 in 24000, the
multitude of alternative anomalies one could have looked for dilutes the
significance of such a posteriori statistics. The simplest small universe model
where the universe has toroidal topology with one small dimension of order half
the horizon scale, in the direction towards Virgo, could explain the three
items above. However, we rule this model out using two topological tests: the
S-statistic and the matched circle test.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309533v2,The cosmological evolution of metal enrichment in quasar host galaxies,"  We study the gas metallicity of quasar hosts using cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations of the Lambda-cold dark matter model. Galaxy formation in the
simulations is coupled with a prescription for black hole activity enabling us
to study the evolution of the metal enrichment in quasar hosts and hence
explore the relationship between star/spheroid formation and black hole
growth/activity. We find a steep radial metallicity gradient in quasar host
galaxies, with gas metallicities close to solar values in the outer parts but
becoming supersolar in the center. The hosts of the rare bright quasars at
z~5-6 have star formation rates of several hundred solar masses per year and
halo masses of order ~10^12 solar masses. Already at these redshifts they have
supersolar (Z ~2-3 solar) central metallicities, with a mild dependence of
metallicity on luminosity, consistent with observed trends. The mean value of
metallicity is sensitive to the assumed quasar lifetime, providing a useful new
probe of this parameter. We find that lifetimes from 10^7-4x10^7yr are favored
by comparison to observational data. In both the models and observations, the
rate of evolution of the mean quasar metallicity as a function of redshift is
generally flat out to z ~ 4-5. Beyond the observed redshift range and out to
redshift z ~ 6-8, we predict a slow decline of the mean central metallicity
towards solar and slightly subsolar values as we approach the epoch of the
first significant star formation activity

shocked, moderately overdense gas in the IGM. The model is an extension of the
Press & Schechter (1974) description for the mass function of halos: we assume
that large-scale structure shocks occur at a fixed overdensity during nonlinear
collapse. This in turn allows us to compute the fraction of gas at a given
redshift that has been shock-heated to a specified temperature. We show that,
if strong shocks occur at turnaround, our model provides a reasonable
description of the temperature distribution seen in cosmological simulations at
z~0, although it does overestimate the importance of weak shocks. We then apply
our model to shocks at high redshifts. We show that, before reionization, the
thermal energy of the IGM is dominated by large-scale structure shocks (rather
than virialized objects). These shocks can have a variety of effects, including
stripping ~10% of the gas from dark matter minihalos, accelerating cosmic rays,
and creating a diffuse radiation background from inverse Compton and cooling
radiation. This radiation background develops before the first stars form and
could have measurable effects on molecular hydrogen formation and the spin
temperature of the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen. Finally, we show that
shock-heating will also be directly detectable by redshifted 21 cm measurements

landmark in the history of the universe, but the processes through which it
occurs remain mysterious. In particular, recent numerical and analytic work
suggest that reionization by stellar sources is driven by large-scale density
fluctuations and must be inhomogeneous on scales of many comoving Mpc. We
examine the prospects for constraining the topology of neutral and ionized gas
through Lyman-alpha absorption of high-redshift sources. One method is to
search for gaps in the Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs of luminous sources.
These could occur if the line of sight passes sufficiently close to the center
of a large HII region. In contrast to previous work, we find a non-negligible
(though still small) probability of observing such a gap before reionization is
complete. In our model the transmission spike at z=6.08 in the spectrum of SDSS
J1148+5251 does not necessarily require overlap to have been completed at an
earlier epoch. We also examine the IGM damping wing absorption of the
Lyman-alpha emission lines of star-forming galaxies. Because most galaxies sit
inside of large HII regions, we find that the severity of absorption is
significantly smaller than previously thought and decoupled from the properties
of the observed galaxy. While this limits our ability to constrain the mean
neutral fraction of the IGM from observations of individual galaxies, it
presents the exciting possibility of measuring the size distribution and
evolution of the ionized bubbles by examining the distribution of damping wing
optical depths in a large sample of galaxies.

the principle of self-regulation, by which supermassive black holes grow until
they release sufficient energy to unbind the gas that feeds them from their
host galaxy. This principle explains several observed facts, including the
correlation between the mass of a central black hole and the depth of the
gravitational potential well of its host galaxy, and the abundance and
clustering properties of bright quasars in the redshift interval of z~2-6. At
lower redshifts, quasars might have limited the maximum mass of galaxies
through the suppression of cooling flows in X-ray clusters. The seeds of
supermassive black holes were likely planted in dwarf galaxies at redshifts
z>10, through the collapse of massive or supermassive stars. The minimum seed
mass can be identified observationally through the detection of gravitational

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408455v1,Primordial Bispectrum Information from CMB Polarization,"  After the precise observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropy power spectrum, attention is now being focused on the higher order
statistics of the CMB anisotropies. Since linear evolution preserves the
statistical properties of the initial conditions, observed non-Gaussianity of
the CMB will mirror primordial non-Gaussianity. Single field slow-roll
inflation robustly predicts negligible non-Gaussianity so an indication of
non-Gaussianity will suggest alternative scenarios need to be considered. In
this paper we calculate the information on primordial non-Gaussianity encoded
in the polarization of the CMB. After deriving the optimal weights for a cubic
estimator we evaluate the Signal-to-Noise ratio of the estimator for WMAP,
Planck and an ideal cosmic variance limited experiment. We find that when the
experiment can observe CMB polarization with good sensitivity, the sensitivity
to primordial non-Gaussianity increases by roughly a factor of two. We also
test the weakly non-Gaussian assumption used to derive the optimal weight
factor by calculating the degradation factor produced by the gravitational
lensing induced connected four-point function. The physical scales in the
radiative transfer functions are largely irrelevant for the constraints on the
primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that the total (S/N)^2 is simply
proportional to the number of observed pixels on the sky.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409656v2,Is Double Reionization Physically Plausible?,"  Recent observations of z~6 quasars and the cosmic microwave background imply
a complex history to cosmic reionization. Such a history requires some form of
feedback to extend reionization over a long time interval, but the nature of
the feedback and how rapidly it operates remain highly uncertain. Here we focus
on one aspect of this complexity: which physical processes can cause the global
ionized fraction to evolve non-monotonically with cosmic time? We consider a
range of mechanisms and conclude that double reionization is much less likely
than a long, but still monotonic, ionization history. We first examine how
galactic winds affect the transition from metal-free to normal star formation.
Because the transition is actually spatially inhomogeneous and temporally
extended, this mechanism cannot be responsible for double reionization given
plausible parameters for the winds. We next consider photoheating, which causes
the cosmological Jeans mass to increase in ionized regions and hence suppresses
galaxy formation there. In this case, double reionization requires that small
halos form stars efficiently, that the suppression from photoheating is strong
relative to current expectations, and that ionizing photons are preferentially
produced outside of previously ionized regions. Finally, we consider H_2
photodissociation, in which the buildup of a soft ultraviolet background
suppresses star formation in small halos. This can in principle cause the
ionized fraction to temporarily decrease, but only during the earliest stages
of reionization. Finally, we briefly consider the effects of some of these
feedback mechanisms on the topology of reionization.

the results of a study suggesting that radio bremsstrahlung from the compressed

to 12 kpc. We discuss the implications of this reduced distance estimate. The

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411108v2,Modeling feedback from stars and black holes in galaxy mergers,"  We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and
black hole accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At
present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on
galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained
representations of the properties of the interstellar medium and black hole
accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these
effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a
multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation
pressurises highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state. We
show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger
gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by
including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive black holes in
galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric
luminosity of accreting black holes to the surrounding gas, we show how this
feedback regulates the growth of black holes. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies,
we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central AGN activity when
the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an
accreting supermassive black hole has grown to a critical size, feedback
terminates its further growth, and expels gas from the central region in a
powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to
address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation, and black hole
accretion during the formation of galaxies.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501548v1,A Dynamical Method for Measuring Masses of Stars with Transiting Planets,"  As a planet transits the face of a star, it accelerates along the
line-of-sight. The changing delay in the propagation of photons produces an
apparent deceleration of the planet across the sky throughout the transit. This
persistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the
transit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly
symmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate
than egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such
as Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this
asymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and
planetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the
orbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}. Therefore, this effect constitutes a new
method for a purely dynamical determination of the mass of the star, which is
currently inferred indirectly with theoretical uncertainties based on spectral
modeling. Radial velocity data for the reflex motion of the star can then be
used to determine the planet's mass. Although orbital eccentricity could
introduce a larger asymmetry than the light propagation delay, the eccentricity
is expected to decay by tidal dissipation to negligible values for a close-in
planet with no perturbing third body. Future detection of the eclipse of a
planet's emission by its star could be used to measure the light propagation
delay across the orbital diameter, 46.7(R/7x10^{11}cm) seconds, and also
determine the stellar mass from the orbital period.

matter, which exerts gravitational attraction but whose exact nature is
unknown. In particular, all galaxies are believed to be embedded in massive
haloes of dark matter. This view has recently been challenged by surprisingly
low random stellar velocities in the outskirts of ordinary elliptical galaxies,
which were interpreted as indicating a lack of dark matter (Mendez et al. 2001;
Romanowsky et al. 2003). Here we show that the low velocities are in fact
compatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. Using numerical
simulations of disc-galaxy mergers, we find that the stellar orbits in the
outer regions of the resulting ellipticals are very elongated. These stars were
torn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close
passage and put on outgoing trajectories. The elongated orbits, combined with
the steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain the
observed low velocities even in the presence of large amounts of dark matter.
Projection effects when viewing a triaxial elliptical can lead to even lower
observed velocities along certain lines of sight.

found at the centers of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to
the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass
of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of
the black holes and the host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a
number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole
mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of
galaxies have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously
follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy
collisions. We find that in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a
merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and
thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas
to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines
the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains
the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity

energy within individual gas particles and dissipates this energy on a
time-scale specified by two free parameters; tau_fb, which sets the dissipative

functions is significantly larger than the S/N of any estimator based on
higher-order correlation functions; justifying our choice to focus on the

meaning it saturates the Cramer-Rao Inequality when the underlying CMB map is
nearly Gaussian. We quantify this restriction by demonstrating that the
suboptimal character of our estimator is proportonal to the square of the
fiducial non-Gaussianity, which is already constrained to be extremely small,
so we can consider the WMAP estimator to be optimal in practice. Our

matter in the universe is in the form of weakly-interacting massive particles
that decoupled early in the history of the universe and cooled adiabatically to
an extremely low temperature. Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon
scales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their
small scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized
cut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at
the thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing
to the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation
field. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at
thermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of
\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.
The suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic
oscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although
the two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a
particle mass of M~100GeV. The initial conditions for recent numerical
simulations of the earliest and smallest objects to have formed in the

peak quasar activity, but that the faint end consists of quasars which are
either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and higher
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the LF corresponds directly to the
maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities, which falls off at

  QSO 2MASS 234449+1221","  We report on the analysis of a short XMM-Newton observation of the reddened
Type 1 QSO 2MASS 234449+1221 first identified in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey.
The underlying X-ray continuum is found to be typical of a broad-line active
galaxy, with photon index Gamma ~ 1.9. Low energy absorption can be modelled by
a column N_H ~ 10^22 cm^{-2} of moderately ionised gas or a smaller column of
cold gas. Addition of a soft X-ray emission component significantly improves
the fit in both cases. With the assumption that the soft X-ray flux represents
emission from gas photoionised by the incident X-ray continuum, a comparison of
the absorbed and emitted luminosities indicates a covering factor of ~ 8-17%.
The unusual opportunity to simultaneously observe and quantify ionised
absorption and emission in 2MASS 234449+1221 is due to the relatively large
opacity (for a Type 1 AGN) of the absorbing gas, which depresses the normally
strong continuum below ~ 1 keV. A comparison of the soft X-ray emission of
2MASS 234449+1221 with that of other Type 1 and Type 2 AGN suggests the
existence of an inner turbulent extension to ionised outflows, not detected in
current high resolution X-ray spectra.

Because directional detectors will be quite difficult to construct it is
worthwhile exploring in advance generally which experimental features will

the ability to distinguish forward versus backward recoils, and compare these

its temperature to >~ 1.e4 K. This photo-heating resulted in an increase of the
minimum mass of galaxies and hence a suppression of the cosmic star formation

massive galaxies that formed later. We show that a massive galaxy at a redshift

region in which the galaxy was assembled. Since massive galaxies originate in
overdense regions where cosmic evolution is accelerated, their environment
reionizes earlier than the rest of the universe. For a galaxy of ~ 1.e12
M_solar in stars at a redshift of z ~ 6.5, the star formation rate should
typically be suppressed at a redshift z >~ 10 since the rest of the universe is

galaxies formed through mergers. Using hundreds of simulations to judge the
impact of progenitor galaxy properties on merger remnants, we find that gas
dissipation provides an important contribution to tilt in the Fundamental Plane
relation. Dissipationless mergers of disks produce remnants that occupy the
virial plane. As the gas content of disk galaxies is increased, the tilt of the
Fundamental Plane relation increases and the slope of the Re-M_* relation
steepens. For gas fractions fgas > 30%, the simulated Fundamental Plane
scalings approach those observed in the K-band. In our simulations, feedback
from supermassive black hole growth has only a minor influence on the
stellar-mass scaling relations of spheroidal galaxies, but may play a role in
maintaining the observed Fundamental Plane tilt at optical wavelengths by
suppressing residual star formation in merger remnants.
  We estimate that \approx 40-100% of the Fundamental Plane tilt induced by
structural properties owes to trends in the central total-to-stellar mass ratio
M_total/M_* produced by dissipation. Lower mass systems obtain greater phase-
space densities than higher mass systems, producing a galaxy mass-dependent
central M_total/M_* and a corresponding tilt in the Fundamental Plane.

line emission by coupling an analytic model with cosmological Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations that are based on the concordance Lambda cold
dark matter (CDM) model. Our analytic model describes a multiphase interstellar
medium irradiated by the far ultra-violet radiation from local star-forming
regions, and it calculates thermal and ionization equilibrium between cooling
and heating. The model allows us to predict the mass fraction of a cold neutral
medium (CNM) embedded in a warm neutral medium (WNM). Our cosmological SPH
simulations include a treatment of radiative cooling/heating, star formation,
and feedback effects from supernovae and galactic winds. Using our method, we
make predictions for the [CII] luminosity from high-redshift galaxies which can
be directly compared with upcoming observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter

by ALMA and SPICA via [CII] emission depends significantly on the amount of
neutral gas which is highly uncertain. Our calculations suggest that, in a CDM

Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) brighter than R_AB=23.5 mag are expected to have
flux densities \Snu = 1-3 mJy depending on the strength of galactic wind
feedback. The recommended observing strategy for ALMA and SPICA is to aim at

synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons, respectively. However, if the
SNR is older than several 10^5 yrs, there are few high-energy particles
emitting TeV gamma-rays because of the energy loss effect and/or the wave
damping effect occurring at low-velocity isothermal shocks. For old SNRs or
SNR-GMC interacting systems capable of generating TeV gamma-ray emitting
particles, we calculated the ratio of TeV gamma-ray (1-10 TeV) to X-ray (2-10

from the expectations based on the virial theorem and homology, including the
""tilt"" of the ""fundamental plane"" and the steep decline of density with mass.
We show that such tilts result from dissipative major mergers once the gas
fraction available for dissipation declines with progenitor mass, and derive
the scaling properties of the progenitors. We use hydrodynamical simulations to
quantify the effects of major mergers with different gas fractions on the
structural properties of galaxies. The tilts are driven by the differential
shrinkage of the effective stellar radius as a function of dissipation in the
merger, while the correlated smaller enhancements in internal velocity and
stellar mass keep the slope of the velocity-stellar mass relation near V \pr
M_*^{1/4}. The progenitors match a straightforward model of disc formation in
LCDM haloes. Their total to stellar mass ratio within the effective radius
varies as M/M_* \pr M_*^-0.25, consistent with supernova feedback. They are
nearly homologous in the sense that the dark-matter fractions within the
effective and virial radii scale with mass in a similar way, with only a weak
decline of density with mass. The progenitor radius is roughly R \pr M_*^0.3,
compatible with today's intermediate late-type galaxies. This indicates that
the latest wet mergers involved relatively big discs. The dissipative gas to
stellar mass ratio is predicted to decline \pr M_*^-0.5, similar to the
observed trend in today's blue sequence galaxies. Such a trend should be
observed in relatively massive gaseous galaxies at z~1-4. The corresponding

resolution and wavelength coverage, but we implement a strict, uniform set of
search criteria to derive a well-defined statistical sample. We identify 15
strong MgII absorbers along 14 GRB sightlines (nearly every sightline exhibits
at least one absorber) with spectra covering a total pathlength Delta z = 15.5
at a mean redshift <z> = 1.1. In contrast, the predicted incidence of such

The roughly four times higher incidence along GRB sightlines is inconsistent
with a statistical fluctuation at greater than 99.9% c.l. Several effects could
explain the result: (i) dust within the MgII absorbers obscures faint quasars
giving a lower observed incidence along quasar sightlines; (ii) the gas is
intrinsic to the GRB event; (iii) the GRB are gravitationally lensed by these
absorbers. We present strong arguments against the first two effects and also
consider lensing to be an unlikely explanation. The results suggest that at

compared to the majority of the population that presumably have a primordial
helium abundance. We assume that a previous generation of massive

gas via a slow stellar wind. We use two independent sets of AGB yields computed
from detailed models to follow the evolution of helium, carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen in the cluster gas using a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a
number of top-heavy IMFs. In no case were we able to fit the observational
constraints, Y > 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant. Depending on the shape
of the IMF and the yields, we either obtained Y approximately greater than 0.30

These results suggest that either AGB stars alone are not responsible for the

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606570v1,Is There a Fundamental Line for Disk Galaxies?,"  We show that there are strong local correlations between metallicity, surface
brightness, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio within M33, analogous to the
fundamental line of dwarf galaxies identified by Prada & Burkert (2002). Using
near-infrared imaging from 2MASS, the published rotation curve of M33, and
literature measurements of the metallicities of HII regions and supergiant
stars, we demonstrate that these correlations hold for points at radial
distances between 140 pc and 6.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. At a given
metallicity or surface brightness, M33 has a mass-to-light ratio approximately
four times as large as the Local Group dwarf galaxies; other than this constant
offset, we see broad agreement between the M33 and dwarf galaxy data. We use
analytical arguments to show that at least two of the three fundamental line
correlations are basic properties of disk galaxies that can be derived from
very general assumptions. We investigate the effect of supernova feedback on
the fundamental line with numerical models and conclude that while feedback
clearly controls the scatter in the fundamental line, it is not needed to
create the fundamental line itself, in agreement with our analytical
calculations. We also compare the M33 data with measurements of a simulated
disk galaxy, finding that the simulation reproduces the trends in the data
correctly and matches the fundamental line, although the metallicity of the
simulated galaxy is too high, and the surface brightness is lower than that of
M33.

regions. The polar jet is nearly consistent with the stationary paraboloidal
Blandford-Znajek model of an organized field threading the polar regions of a

angular-integrated toroidal current distribution $dI_\phi/dr \propto r^{-5/4}$,
where $I_\phi(r)$ is the toroidal current enclosed inside radius $r$. We
demonstrate that the poloidal magnetic field in the simulated jet agrees well
with the force-free field solution for a non-rotating thin disk with an
$r^{-5/4}$ toroidal current, suggesting rotation leads to negligible
self-collimation. We find that the polar field is confined/collimated by the
corona. The electromagnetic field in the disk also scales as $r^{-5/4}$, which
is consistent with some Newtonian accretion models that assume rough
equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure. However, the agreement is
accidental since toward the black hole the magnetic pressure increases faster
than the gas pressure. This field dominance near the black hole is associated
with magnetic stresses that imply a large effective viscosity parameter

magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical models of accretion disks, although being
highly turbulent, have surprisingly simple electromagnetic properties. In
particular, the toroidal current density in the disk takes the form $dI_\phi/dr
\propto r^{-5/4}$. Guided by this simplicity, we use a time-dependent general
relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) code to study an idealized
problem in which the accretion disk is replaced by an infinitely thin rotating
equatorial current sheet. We consider both an $r^{-5/4}$ current profile and an
$r^{-1}$ profile, the latter corresponding to the paraboloidal model of
Blandford & Znajek (1977). The force-free magnetosphere we obtain with the
$r^{-5/4}$ current sheet matches remarkably well to the Poynting-dominated jet
seen in GRMHD numerical models. By comparing to the non-rotating force-free
model studied in paper I, rotation is seen to lead to mild decollimation of the
jet suggesting that hoop-stress forces nearly cancel centrifugal forces. In
order to study the process that generates the corona and disk wind and destroys
the ordered field in the corona in GRMHD numerical models, the force-free field
with the $r^{-5/4}$ current distribution is embedded in an accretion disk and
followed in a GRMHD simulation. Reconnection and magnetic stresses contribute
to a magnetized, thermal wind without the aid of an ordered field threading the

limit to the allowed degree of evolution in the ratio of black hole (BH) mass

the BH/host ratio is excessive at redshift z, then it would imply that the
total mass density in BHs above some M_BH(min) is larger at that redshift than
at z=0, which is impossible. This argument requires no knowledge of host or BH
properties, only a lower limit to the observed luminosity density in the
brightest galaxies at some z. We calculate this upper limit from a variety of
luminosity and mass functions in different bands from redshifts z=0-2. We show
that it is consistent with passive evolution of spheroid populations (with a
fixed M_BH/M_host relation) in all cases, and provides tighter constraints than
have generally been obtained previously, ruling out at >6 sigma observational
and theoretical estimates suggesting that M_BH/M_host was significantly larger
at high redshifts than locally, although relatively weak (factor ~2 by z=2)
evolution is still allowed. We discuss a variety of possible 'loopholes' or

spontaneous bar formation. We suggest that the stellar bar and the dust pattern

triggered by a tidal interaction with a small companion. A statistical analysis

orbiting BH and be kicked out of the Galactic centre with velocities up to

sufficient to account for all of the hypervelocity B-stars observed in the

than the relaxation time-scale at a distance ~2 pc from Sgr A* (>~ 2 Gyr).
Since HVSs are produced by at least two unavoidable processes, the statistics
of HVSs could reveal bimodal velocity and mass distributions, and can constrain
the distribution of BHs and stars in the innermost 0.1 pc around Sgr A*.

light on the behaviour of anomalous Cepheids whose representatives have been

observations have been obtained. The actual period and amplitude of pulsation

differs from the ordinary classical Cepheids in several respects. Its most
peculiar feature is cycle-to-cycle variability of the light curve. The radial
velocity phase curve is not stable either. The pulsation period is subjected to
strong changes on various time scales including a very short one. The ratio of
amplitudes determined from the photometric and radial velocity observations
indicates that this Cepheid performs an overtone pulsation, in accord with the
other known anomalous Cepheid in our Galaxy, BL Boo (V19 in the globular
cluster NGC 5466). Continued observations are necessary to study the deviations
from regularity, to determine their time scale, as well as to confirm binarity

we present mock Chandra analyses of cosmological cluster simulations and assess
X-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties using a model and procedure

reconstruction of three-dimensional ICM density and temperature profiles is
excellent for relaxed clusters, but still reasonably accurate for unrelaxed
systems. The total ICM mass is measured quite accurately (<6%) in all clusters,
while the hydrostatic estimate of the gravitationally bound mass is biased low
by about 5%-20% through the virial region, primarily due to additional pressure
support provided by subsonic bulk motions in the ICM, ubiquitous in our
simulations even in relaxed systems. Gas fraction determinations are therefore
biased high; the bias increases toward cluster outskirts and depends
sensitively on its dynamical state, but we do not observe significant trends of
the bias with cluster mass or redshift. We also find that different average ICM
temperatures, such as the X-ray spectroscopic Tspec and gas-mass-weighted Tmg,
are related to each other by a constant factor with a relatively small
object-to-object scatter and no systematic trend with mass, redshift or the

of the gas in the relic HII region is also followed in a full cosmological
context, until second-generation stars are formed. A large HII region with a

inefficient. Recombination radiation within the HII region is weak, but
persists for 50 million years. We also follow the thermal and chemical
evolution of the photo-ionized gas in the relic HII region. The gas cools by HD
line cooling down to a few tens Kelvin. At high redshifts (z>10), the minimum

significantly smaller than a typical clump mass for early primordial gas
clouds. We find no evidence of fragmentation by this epoch. Together with the

the very early universe to radiative emission from newly-formed stars. This
gives the intergalactic medium a dual role as a powerful probe both of
fundamental physics and of astrophysics. The heading of fundamental physics
includes conditions in the very early universe and basic cosmological
parameters. The astrophysics refers to chapters of the long cosmic history of
stars and galaxies that are being revealed through the effects of stellar
feedback on the cosmic gas. This review describes the physics of the
intergalactic medium, focusing on recent theoretical and observational
developments in understanding early cosmic history. In particular, radiation
from the earliest generation of stars is thought to have transformed the
universe, turning the surrounding atoms into free electrons and ions. Knowing
exactly when and how the reionization process happened is a primary goal of
cosmologists, because this would tell us when the early stars and black holes
formed and in what kinds of galaxies.
  Cosmic reionization is beginning to be understood with the help of
theoretical models and computer simulations. A wide variety of instruments
currently under design will probe the first sources of light during an epoch in
cosmic history that has been largely unexplored so far. The new observations
and the challenges for theoretical models and numerical simulations will

regions of quasar spectra depend on the mass of the dark matter halos hosting
the quasars. This is owing to both the overdensity around the quasars and the
associated infall of gas toward them. For a fiducial quasar host halo mass of
(3.0+/-1.6) h^-1 x 10^12 Msun, as inferred by Croom et al. from clustering in
the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, we show that estimates of the ionizing background
(Gamma^bkg) from proximity effect measurements could be biased high by a factor
of ~2.5 at z=3 owing to neglecting these effects alone. The clustering of
galaxies and other active galactic nuclei around the proximity effect quasars
enhances the local background, but is not expected to skew measurements by more
than a few percent. Assuming the measurements of Gamma^bkg based on the mean
flux decrement in the Ly-alpha forest to be free of bias, we demonstrate how
the proximity effect analysis can be inverted to measure the mass of the dark
matter halos hosting quasars. In ideal conditions, such a measurement could be
made with a precision comparable to the best clustering constraints to date
from a modest sample of only about 100 spectra. We discuss observational
difficulties, including continuum flux estimation, quasar systematic redshift
determination, and quasar variability, which make accurate proximity effect
measurements challenging in practice. These are also likely to contribute to
the discrepancies between existing proximity effect and flux decrement
measurements of Gamma^bkg.

Our model accounts for gas clumping in the IGM and for the fact that
high-redshift galaxies reside in overdense regions, which causes the velocity
field of the IGM to depart from the Hubble flow. The observed shape of the Lya
line varies widely, with dependence on the intrinsic width and systemic
velocity of the line, a galaxies star formation rate and the local
extra-galactic UV-background. For large star formation rates and levels of the
UV-background, absorption in the IGM does not result in a Lya line that is
asymmetric as is common among known high-redshift Lya emitters. For models in
which the lines do show the observed strong asymmetry, the IGM typically
transmits only 10-30% of the Lya flux. The increase in the ionising background
that accompanied the completion of reionisation barely increased the IGM
transmission, which suggests that LAEs of comparable luminosity should not
appear to be significantly dimmer prior to overlap. In this light, we briefly
discuss the potential of Lya emitters as a probe into the epoch of
reionisation.

suffices to keep a disk completely ionized through irradiation and, thus, keep
the viscosity at a sufficiently high level to allow effective transport of
matter to the compact object. We employ this distinguishing factor on data from
RXTE and BeppoSAX to identify six new candidate UCXBs, thus increasing the
population by one quarter. The candidates are drawn from the population of
persistently accreting and type-I X-ray bursting low-mass X-ray binaries. The
X-ray bursts establish the low-mass X-ray binary nature and provide a handle on
the accretion rate. We find that the low accretion rates are supported by the

configurations are unstable to large-scale dynamical perturbations, and decay
via reconnection on an Alfvenic timescale. Nevertheless, a number of classes of

Numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale poloidal field in these
systems is stabilized by a toroidal component of the field in the stellar
interior. Using the principle of conservation of total helicity, we develop a
variational principle for computing the structure of the magnetic field inside
a conducting sphere surrounded by an insulating vacuum. We show that, for a
fixed total helicity, the minimum energy state corresponds to a force-free

by angular and radial quantum numbers. However, these solutions have a
discontinuity in the toroidal magnetic field at the stellar surface which will
exert a toroidal stress on the surface of the star. We then describe two other
classes of solutions, the standard spheromak solutions and ones with fixed
surface magnetic fields, the latter being relevant for neutron stars with rigid

Such speeds would enable the merger product to escape its host galaxy. Here we

is opened around it in the disk which delays the consumption of gas prior to
the eventual BH ejection. The punctured disk remains bound to the ejected BH
within the region where the gas orbital velocity is larger than the ejection

for protein folding. The potential is obtained by optimization procedure, which
simultaneously maximizes the energy gap for {\it all} proteins in the database.
To test our method and compare it with other knowledge-based approaches to
derive potentials, we use simple lattice model. In the framework of the lattice
model we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice
chain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures
with some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a
potential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential. This test on
the model system showed that our procedure is able to recover the potential
with correlation $r \approx 91\%$ with the ``true'' one and we were able to
fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical
knowledge-based approaches were tested using lattice models and the results
indicate that they also can recover the ``true'' potential with high degree of
accuracy. When applied to real protein structures with energy function taken in
contact pairwise approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than
existing ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys

folding. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should
be taken into account to achieve better energy gaps. The suggested method is
general to allow to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated
energy function. The internal control of validity of the potential derived by
our method, is converegency to a unique solution upon addition of new proteins

cylindrical obstacle is perhaps the simplest example of statistical mechanics
in a multiply connected geometry. As shown by S.F. Edwards, this problem is
closely related to the quantum mechanics of a charged particle interacting with
a Aharonov-Bohm flux. In another development, Pollock and Ceperley have shown
that boson world lines in 2+1 dimensions with periodic boundary conditions,
regarded as ring polymers on a torus, have a mean square winding number given
by $<W^2> = 2n_s\hbar^2/mk_BT$, where $m$ is the boson mass and $n_s$ is the
superfluid number density. Here, we review the mapping of the statistical
mechanics of polymers with constraints onto quantum mechanics, and show that
there is an interesting generalization of the Pollock-Ceperley result to
directed polymer melts interacting with a repulsive rod of radius $a$. When
translated into boson language, the mean square winding number around the rod
for a system of size $R$ perpendicular to the rod reads $<W^2> =
{n_s\hbar^2\over 2\pi mk_BT}\ln(R/a)$. This result is directly applicable to
vortices in Type II superconductors in the presence of columnar defects. An
external current passing through the rod couples directly to the winding number
in this case.

of double-stranded DNA under the influence of an applied force. In the limit of
long polymers, there is a thermodynamic unzipping transition at a critical
force value of order 10 pN, with different critical behavior for homopolymers
and for random heteropolymers. We extend results on the disorder-averaged
behavior of DNA's with random sequences to the more experimentally accessible
problem of unzipping a single DNA molecule. As the applied force approaches the
critical value, the double-stranded DNA unravels in a series of discrete,
sequence-dependent steps that allow it to reach successively deeper energy
minima. Plots of extension versus force thus take the striking form of a series
of plateaus separated by sharp jumps. Similar qualitative features should
reappear in micromanipulation experiments on proteins and on folded RNA
molecules. Despite their unusual form, the extension versus force curves for
single molecules still reveal remnants of the disorder-averaged critical
behavior. Above the transition, the dynamics of the unzipping fork is related
to that of a particle diffusing in a random force field; anomalous,
disorder-dominated behavior is expected until the applied force exceeds the
critical value for unzipping by roughly 5 pN.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9910018v1,Decoupling Control from Data for TCP Congestion Control,"  Many applications want to use TCP congestion control to regulate the
transmission rate of a data packet stream. A natural way to achieve this goal
is to transport the data packet stream on a TCP connection. However, because
TCP implements both congestion and error control, transporting a data packet
stream directly using a TCP connection forces the data packet stream to be
subject to TCP's other properties caused by TCP error control, which may be
inappropriate for these applications.
  The TCP decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of
applying TCP congestion control to a data packet stream without actually
transporting the data packet stream on a TCP connection. Instead, a TCP
connection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up
separately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then
associated with that of the TCP packets. Since the transmission rate of these
TCP packets is under TCP congestion control, so is that of the data packet
stream. Furthermore, since the data packet stream is not transported on a TCP
connection, the regulated data packet stream is not subject to TCP error
control.
  Because of this flexibility, the TCP decoupling approach opens up many new
opportunities, solves old problems, and improves the performance of some
existing applications. All of these advantages will be demonstrated in the
thesis.
  This thesis presents the design, implementation, and analysis of the TCP
decoupling approach, and its successful applications in TCP trunking, wireless
communication, and multimedia streaming.

attractive theory of the semantics of natural language questions, commonly

analyses, such as Hamblin's and Karttunen's semantics, and computational
systems, such as Prolog. Our comparison separates a notion of answerhood into

derives from the cyclic properties of the topological manifold Q=2T^3 + 3S^1 x
S^2 which has 23 intrinsic degrees of freedom, discrete Z_3 and Z_2 x Z_3
internal groups, an SU(5) gauge group, and an anomalous U(1) symmetry. These
properties reproduce the standard model with a stable proton, a natural place
for CP violation and doublet-triplet splitting. The equation of motion for the
unified theory is derived and leads to a Higgs field. The thermodynamic
properties of Q are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic
microwave background fluctuations. The manifold Q possesses internal energy
scales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which
constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the
electron and its neutrino are identified as ground states and their masses are
predicted. The correct masses of quarks and the CKM mixing angles can be
derived as well from these energy scales if one uses the anomalous U(1)
symmetry. Furthermore, it is shown that if the Planck scale topology of the
universe involves loops as fundamental objects, its spatial dimension is equal
to three. The existence of the prime manifold T^3=S^1 x S^1 S^1 is then
required for a dynamical universe, i.e. a universe which supports forces. Some

the same universality class as the classical O(4) magnet. To test this
hypothesis, critical exponents characterizing the behaviour of universal
quantities near the 2nd order critical point can be calculated and compared to
results from lattice simulations. Present simulations already allow many
qualitative tests; quantitative tests await future simulations with longer
correlation lengths. In a heavy ion collision, a long correlation length would
lead to large fluctuations in the number ratio of neutral to charged pions.
Unfortunately, no equilibrium correlation length gets long enough for this to
occur. Modelling the dynamics of the chiral order parameter in a far from
equilibrium transition by quenching in the linear sigma model suggests that
long wavelength modes of the pion field can be amplified. This could have
dramatic phenomenological consequences. Theoretical advances include attempts
to relax the quench approximation and to include expansion and quantum effects.
Long wavelength pion oscillations arise in a number of theoretical treatments;
however, all involve idealizations and are at best qualitative guides. It is up
to experimentalists to determine whether such phenomena occur; detection in a
heavy ion collision would imply an out of equilibrium chiral transition.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9506331v2,A Lattice Construction of Chiral Gauge Theories,"  We formulate chiral gauge theories non-perturbatively, using two different
cuttoffs for the fermions and gauge bosons. We use a lattice with spacing $b$
to regulate the gauge fields in standard fashion, while computing the chiral
fermion determinant on a finer lattice with spacing $f << b$. This determinant
is computed in the background of $f$-lattice gauge fields, obtained by
gauge-covariantly interpolating $b$-lattice gauge fields. The notorious
doublers that plague lattice theories containing fermions are decoupled by the
addition of a Wilson term. In chiral theories such a term breaks gauge
invariance explicitly. However, the advantage of the two-cutoff regulator is
that gauge invariance can be restored to $O(f^2/b^2)$ by a {\it one-loop}
subtraction of calculable local gauge field counterterms. We show that the only
obstruction to this procedure is the presence of an uncancelled gauge anomaly
among the fermion representations. We conclude that for practical purposes, it
suffices to choose $f/b \sim b/L$, where $L^4$ is the physical volume of the
system. In our construction it is simple to prove the Adler-Bardeen theorem for
anomalies in global currents to all orders. The related subject of fermion

$B$ mesons decay much more copiously to final states with no open charm than
currently assumed, or $B(D^0 \to K^-\pi^+)$ has to be reduced significantly.
This note takes the experimental $B(D^0 \to K^-\pi^+)$ at its face value and
estimates $B(b\to$ no open charm) using complementary methods: one accounts for
the $c$ quark in $b\to c$ transitions, the other accounts for the $\bar c$

average gives our best estimate of $B(b\to$ no open charm), and the difference
measures the consistency. The results of the methods are consistent with each
other, strongly suggesting a much enhanced $B(b\to$ no open charm). This
observation indicates that non-perturbative QCD effects are probably causing a
sizable fraction of the $b\to c\bar cs$ transitions to be seen as charmless
$b\to s$ processes, contrary to smaller traditional expectations. This
mechanism has generally been overlooked and may explain the existing
experimental data within the framework of the standard model. We then briefly

fermion. At low energies, these theories contain one or two Higgs doublets
respectively. We then derive the low energy effective Higgs potential in detail
for the two-doublet theory as well as study the likely experimental signatures
for both theories. A strong constraint on the one-doublet model is the measured
value of the rho parameter which permits the new heavy fermion to have a mass
of about 5-7 TeV, when the Higgs has a mass greater than 300 GeV. In the
two-doublet model, mixing of the new heavy Y=-2/3 fermion and the b quark
affects the prediction for R_b. In order to agree with the current limits on
R_b, the mass of this fermion should be at least 12 TeV. The mass of the heavy
Y=4/3 fermion in the two-doublet model is not as sharply constrained by
experiments and can be as light as 2.5 TeV.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9909482v2,Restoring the sting to metric preheating,"  The relative growth of field and metric perturbations during preheating is
sensitive to initial conditions set in the preceding inflationary phase. Recent
work suggests this may protect super-Hubble metric perturbations from resonant
amplification during preheating. We show that this possibility is fragile and
sensitive to the specific form of the interactions between the inflaton and
other fields. The suppression is naturally absent in two classes of preheating
in which either (1) the vacua of the non-inflaton fields during inflation are
deformed away from the origin, or (2) the effective masses of non-inflaton
fields during inflation are small but during preheating are large. Unlike the
simple toy model of a $g^2 \phi^2 \chi^2$ coupling, most realistic particle
physics models contain these other features. Moreover, they generically lead to
both adiabatic and isocurvature modes and non-Gaussian scars on super-Hubble
scales. Large-scale coherent magnetic fields may also appear naturally.

brane models in general in the presence of a radius stabilization mechanism. We
find that the expansion of our universe is generically in agreement with the
expected effective four dimensional description. The constraint (which is
responsible for the appearance of non-conventional cosmologies in these models)
that must be imposed on the matter densities on the two branes in the theory
without a stabilized radius is a consequence of requiring a static solution
even in the absence of stabilization. Such constraints disappear in the
presence of a stablizing potential, and the ordinary FRW
(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) equations are reproduced, with the expansion
driven by the sum of the physical values of the energy densities on the two
branes and in the bulk. For the case of the Randall-Sundrum model we examine
the kinematics of the radion field, and find that corrections to the standard
FRW equations are small for temperatures below the weak scale. We find that the
radion field has renormalizable and unsuppressed couplings to Standard Model
particles after electroweak symmetry breaking. These couplings may have
important implications for collider searches. We comment on the possibility
that matter off the TeV brane could serve as a dark matter candidate.

breaking in which the standard model Higgs particle is realized as a
pseudo-Goldstone boson and thus is generically light. The symmetry breaking
structure of the Little Higgs models predicts a large multiplet of
(pseudo-)Goldstone bosons and their low energy interactions below the
ultraviolet (UV) completion scale $\Lambda \sim 4\pi f \sim O(10)$ TeV, where
$f$ is the Goldstone decay constant. We study unitarity of the Little Higgs
models by systematically analyzing the high energy scatterings of these
(pseudo-)Goldstone bosons. We reveal that the collective effect of the
Goldstone scatterings via coupled channel analysis tends to push the unitarity
violation scale $\Lambda_U$ significantly below the conventional UV scale
$\Lambda \sim 4\pi f$ as estimated by naive dimensional analysis (NDA).
Specifically, $\Lambda_U \sim (3-4)f$, lying in the multi-TeV range for $f\sim
1$ TeV. We interpret this as an encouraging sign that the upcoming LHC may
explore aspects of Little Higgs UV completions, and we discuss some potential
signatures. The meanings of the two estimated UV scales $\Lambda_U$ (from

is then presented. The universal ground state of the constructed theory derives
from the cyclic properties ($S^1$ homotopy) of the topological manifold
$Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$ which has 23 intrinsic degrees of freedom,
discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal groups, an SU(5) or SO(10) gauge
group, and leads to an anomalous U(1) symmetry on a lattice. These properties
can in principle reproduce the standard model with a stable proton. The general
equation of motion for the unified theory is derived up to the Planck energy
and leads to a Higgs field with possible inflation. The thermodynamic
properties of $Q$ are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic
microwave background fluctuations. The manifold $Q$ possesses internal energy
scales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which
constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the
electron and its neutrino are identified as particle ground states and their
masses are predicted. The mass of the electron agrees very well with
observations. A heuristic argument for the occurrence and magnitude of CP

due to OPE singularities near the boundary interaction, the computation of
boundary correlators is a challenging problem which we address but do not fully

Liouville to TBL encounters an infinite accumulation of poles and zeros. A
particular contour prescription is proposed which cancels the poles against the

tachyon condensation. The rate so obtained agrees at large $\o$ with a

perturbations of Cuscuton propagate superluminally, we show that they have a
locally degenerate phase space volume (or zero entropy), implying that they

coupling to ordinary scalar fields cannot lead to superluminal signal

which are the analogs of soap films (or soap bubbles) in a Euclidian space.
This enables us to find the most general solution in 1+1 dimensions, whose
properties motivate conjectures for global degeneracy of the phase space in

morphisms between toric varieties. In particular, a complete toric description
of fibers - both generic and non-generic -, image, and the flattening
stratification of a toric morphism are given. Two examples are provided to
illustrate the discussions. We then turn to the study of the restriction of a
toric morphism to a toric hypersurface. The details of this can be understood
by the various restrictions of a line bundle with a section that defines the
hypersurface. These general toric geometry discussions give rise to a
computational scheme for the details of a toric morphism and the induced
fibration of toric hypersurfaces therein. We apply this scheme to study the
family of 4-dimensional elliptic Calabi-Yau toric hypersurfaces that appear in
a recent work of Braun-Candelas-dlOssa-Grassi. The Maple codes that are
employed for the computation are provided. Some directions for future work are
listed in the end.

http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0308296v1,Modular forms and arithmetic geometry,"  This article describes results of joint work with Michael Rapoport and
Tonghai Yang. First, we construct an modular form \phi(\tau) of weight 3/2
valued in the arithmetic Chow group of the arithmetic surface M attached toa
Shimura curve over Q. The q-expansion of this function is an analogue of the
Hirzebruch-Zagier generating function for the cohomology classes of curves on a
Hilbert modular surface. This`arithmetic theta function' is used to define an
`arithmetic theta lift' from modular forms of weight 3/2 to the arithmetic Chow
group of M. For integers t_1 and t_2 with t_1t_2 not a square, the
(t_1,t_2)-Fourier coefficient of the height pairing <\phi(\tau_1),\phi(\tau_2)>
coincides with the (t_1,t_2)-Fourier coefficient of the restriction to the
diagonal of the central derivative of a certain Eisenstein series of weight 3/2
and genus 2. Using this fact and results about the doubling integral for forms
of weight 3/2, we prove that the arithmetic theta lift of a Hecke eigenform f
is nonzero if and only if there is no local obstruction (theta dichotomy) and
the standard Hecke L-function L(s,F) of the corresponding newform F of weight 2
has nonvanishing derivative, L'(1,F)\ne0, at the center of symmetry. This is an
analogue of a result of Waldspurger according to which the classical Shimura
lift of such a form is nonzero if and only if there is no local obstruction and
L(1,F)\ne0. Detailed proofs will be given elsewhere.

improves and extends previous results of Pao [46]. We also obtain constructive
coercivity estimates for the Landau collision operator for the optimal

http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0001003v1,Magnetic Trapping of Neutrons,"  Accurate measurement of the lifetime of the neutron (which is unstable to
beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force and the
creation of matter during the Big Bang. Previous measurements of the neutron
lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors; however, these
could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in
a magnetic trap. Neutral and charged particle traps are widely used tool for
studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long
interaction times and isolation from perturbing environments. Here we report
the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with
superfluid 4-He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a
scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons have a lifetime in the trap of 750
+330/-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap losses.
Our experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding the loading process
and magnetic trapping of neutrons. Further refinement of this method should
lead to improved precision in the neutron lifetime measurement.

nonstationary sequences formed in three ways: (i) stitching together segments
of data obtained from discontinuous experimental recordings, or removing some
noisy and unreliable parts from continuous recordings and stitching together
the remaining parts -- a ``cutting'' procedure commonly used in preparing data
prior to signal analysis; (ii) adding to a signal with known correlations a
tunable concentration of random outliers or spikes with different amplitude,
and (iii) generating a signal comprised of segments with different properties
-- e.g. different standard deviations or different correlation exponents. We
compare the difference between the scaling results obtained for stationary
correlated signals and correlated signals with these three types of
nonstationarities.

  Gutenberg-Richter law","  A new non-parametric statistic is introduced for the characterization of
deviations from power laws. It is tested on the distribution of seismic
energies given by the Gutenberg-Richter law. Based on the two first statistical
log-moments, it evaluates quantitatively the deviations of the distribution of
scalar seismic moments from a power-like (Pareto) law. This statistic is close
to zero for the Pareto law with arbitrary power index, and deviates from zero
for any non-Pareto distribution. A version of this statistic for discrete
distribution of quantified magnitudes is also given. A methodology based on
this statistics consisting in scanning the lower threshold for earthquake
energies provides an explicit visualization of deviations from the Pareto law,
surpassing in sensitivity the standard Hill estimator or other known
techniques. This new statistical technique has been applied to shallow
earthquakes (h < 70 km) both in subduction zones and in mid-ocean ridge zones
(using the Harvard catalog of seismic moments, 1977-2000), and to several
regional catalogs of magnitudes (California, Japan, Italy, Greece). We discover
evidence for log-periodicity and thus for a discrete hierarchy of scales for
low-angle dipping, low-strain subduction zones with a preferred scaling ratio
g=7+-1 for seismic moments, compatible with a preferred scaling ratio of 2 for
linear rupture sizes, and consistent with previous reports. We propose a
possible mechanism in terms of cascades of fault competitions.

demonstrated in silicon, intensity modulators operating at Terahertz speeds
have not been reported because of silicon's weak ultrafast optical
nonlinearity. We have demonstrated intensity modulation of light with light in
a silicon-polymer integrated waveguide device, based on the all-optical Kerr
effect - the same ultrafast effect used in four-wave mixing. Direct
measurements of time-domain intensity modulation are made at speeds of 10 GHz.
We showed experimentally that the ultrafast mechanism of this modulation
functions at the optical frequency through spectral measurements, and that
intensity modulation at frequencies in excess of 1 THz can be obtained in this
device. By integrating optical polymers through evanescent coupling to
high-mode-confinement silicon waveguides, we greatly increase the effective
nonlinearity of the waveguide for cross-phase modulation. The combination of
high mode confinement, multiple integrated optical components, and high
nonlinearities produces all-optical ultrafast devices operating at
continuous-wave power levels compatible with telecommunication systems.
Although far from commercial radio frequency optical modulator standards in
terms of extinction, these devices are a first step in development of
large-scale integrated ultrafast optical logic in silicon, and are two orders
of magnitude faster than previously reported silicon devices.

predicts that, above a triggering magnitude cut-off $M_0$, the exponent $p$ of
the Omori law for the seismic decay of aftershocks is a linear increasing
function $p(M) =a M+b$ of the main shock magnitude $M$. We previously reported
empirical support for this prediction, using the Southern California SCEC

newly defined Scaling Function Analysis, adapted from the wavelet transform.
This method is able to measure a singularity ($p$-value), erasing the possible
regular part of a time series. The Scaling Function Analysis also proves
particularly efficient to reveal the coexistence of several types of relaxation
laws (typical Omori sequences and short-lived swarms sequences) which can be
mixed within the same catalog. The same methods are used on data from the
worlwide Harvard CMT and show results compatible with those of Southern
California. For the Japanese JMA catalog, we still observe a linear dependence

show that if social ties are allowed to change with cultural influence, a

simultaneously increasing social connectedness. Our results show that in
certain regions of the parameter space these co-evolutionary dynamics can lead

the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of
the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the
self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for
GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the
evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the
source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration
of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be
relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a
radius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge
between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated
GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave
distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in

gradients due to other gas properties) are small in all cases and not a
significant cause of error in metallicity studies. Strong emission lines from
HII regions are often used to study the metallicity of star-forming regions. We
compare integrated emission line spectra from our models and quantify any
systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, central
location for all ionising sources. We find that the dependence of the
metallicity indicators on the ionisation parameter causes a clear bias, due to
the fact that models with a fully distributed configuration of stars always
display lower ionisation parameters than their fully concentrated counterparts.
The errors found imply that the geometrical distribution of ionisation sources

including new observations of three sources: 4U 0614+09, LMC X-2 and GX 349+2.
The average radio-OIR spectrum for NSXBs is alpha ~ +0.2 (where L_nu propto
nu^alpha) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected. This is
comparable to, but slightly more inverted than the alpha ~ 0.0 found for black

are compared to those expected if the OIR emission is dominated by thermal
emission from an X-ray or viscously heated disc, or synchrotron emission from
the inner regions of the jets. We find that thermal emission due to X-ray
reprocessing can explain all the data except at high luminosities for some
NSXBs, namely the atolls and millisecond X-ray pulsars (MSXPs). Optically thin
synchrotron emission from the jets (with an observed OIR spectral index of

evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. Combining halo mass
functions (MFs) with empirical halo occupation models, we calculate where major
galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts.
We compare with observed merger MFs, clustering, fractions, and small-scale
environments, and show that this yields robust estimates in good agreement with
observations. Making the simple ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause
quasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observed
rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density from z=0-6, as well as quasar
LFs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift
and luminosity. The observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales is a
natural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regions

at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined
small group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. We
contrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/disk
instabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at Seyfert
luminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale),
pseudobulge populations, disk MFs, luminosity density evolution, and host
galaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z>1 quasar
luminosity density.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4036v2,"Disrupting Terrorist Networks, a dynamic fitness landscape approach","  Over a period of approximately five years, Pankaj Ghemawat of Harvard
Business School and Daniel Levinthal of the Wharton School have been working on
a detailed simulation (producing approximately a million fitness landscape
graphs) in order to determine optimal patterns of decision-making for
corporations. In 2006, we adapted this study, combining it with our own work on
terrorism to examine what would happen if we inverted Ghemawat and Levinthal's
findings and sought to provide disinformation or otherwise interfere with the
communications and decision processes of terrorist organizations in order to
optimize poor decision making and inefficiencies in organizational
coordination, command and control.
  The bulk of this study was then presented at the 2006 annual meeting of the
North American Association for Computation in the Social and Organizational
Sciences. We present here an updated version of that study, emphasizing the
rather counter-intuitive finding that ""soft"" targets have almost no value and
that unless one can influence key factors, an effort directed at the easy to
reach elements of terrorist organizations may actually be worse than mounting
no effort at all. We conclude with the recommendation that some fundamental
rethinking may be required if the United States is to effectively defend itself
from future terrorist attacks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3511v1,The effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger--driven starbursts,"  We employ numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to explore the effect of
galaxy mass ratio on merger--driven starbursts. Our numerical simulations
include radiative cooling of gas, star formation, and stellar feedback to
follow the interaction and merger of four disk galaxies. The galaxy models span
a factor of 23 in total mass and are designed to be representative of typical
galaxies in the local Universe. We find that the merger--driven star formation
is a strong function of merger mass ratio, with very little, if any, induced
star formation for large mass ratio mergers. We define a burst efficiency that
is useful to characterize the merger--driven star formation and test that it is
insensitive to uncertainties in the feedback parameterization. In accord with
previous work we find that the burst efficiency depends on the structure of the
primary galaxy. In particular, the presence of a massive stellar bulge
stabilizes the disk and suppresses merger--driven star formation for large mass
ratio mergers. Direct, co--planar merging orbits produce the largest tidal
disturbance and yield that most intense burst of star formation. Contrary to
naive expectations, a more compact distribution of gas or an increased gas
fraction both decrease the burst efficiency. Owing to the efficient feedback
model and the newer version of SPH employed here, the burst efficiencies of the
mergers presented here are smaller than in previous studies.

A0620-00 with the the 6.5-m Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas
Observatory. We measure absorption-line radial velocities of the secondary and
make the most precise determination to date (K2 = 435.4 +/- 0.5 km/s). By
fitting the rotational broadening of the secondary, we refine the mass ratio to
q = 0.060 +/- 0.004; these results, combined with the orbital period, imply a
minimum mass for the compact object of 3.10 +/- 0.04 Msun. Although quiescence
implies little accretion activity, we find that the disc contributes 56 +/- 7
per cent of the light in B and V, and is subject to significant flickering.
Doppler maps of the Balmer lines reveal bright emission from the gas
stream-disc impact point and unusual crescent-shaped features. We also find
that the disc centre of symmetry does not coincide with the predicted black
hole velocity. By comparison with SPH simulations, we identify this source with
an eccentric disc. With high S/N, we pursue modulation tomography of H-alpha
and find that the aforementioned bright regions are strongly modulated at the
orbital period. We interpret this modulation in the context of disc precession,
and discuss cases for the accretion disc evolution.

population synthesis method, modeling the birth properties of the pulsars,
their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and Swinburne Multibeam
(MB) surveys. Together, the Parkes and Swinburne MB surveys have detected
nearly 2/3 of the known pulsars and provide a remarkably homogeneous sample to
compare with simulations. New proper motion measurements and an improved model
of the distribution of free electrons in the interstellar medium, NE2001, also
make revisiting these issues particularly worthwhile. We present a simple
population model that reproduces the actual observations well, and consider
others that fail. We conclude that: pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with
the birthrate of 2.8+/-0.5 pulsars/century peaking at a distance ~3 kpc from
the Galactic centre, and with mean initial speed of 380^{+40}_{-60} km/s; the
birth spin period distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no
evidence of multimodality, implying that characteristic ages overestimate the
true ages of the pulsars by a median factor >2 for true ages <30,000 yr; models
in which the radio luminosities of the pulsars are random generically fail to
reproduce the observed P-Pdot diagram, suggesting a relation between intrinsic
radio luminosity and (P, Pdot); radio luminosities L Edot^0.5 provide a good
match to the observed P-Pdot diagram; for this favored radio luminosity model,
we find no evidence for significant magnetic field decay over the lifetime of
the pulsars as radio sources ~100 Myr.

previous observations of a bump in the dust-correlated spectrum, consistent
with the Draine & Lazarian spinning dust model. 2. We also confirm the ""haze""
signal in the inner Galaxy, and argue that it does not follow a free-free
spectrum as first thought, but instead is synchrotron emission from a hard
electron cosmic-ray population. 3. In a departure from previous work, we allow
the spectrum of Halpha-correlated emission (which is used to trace the
free-free component) to float in the fit, and find that it does not follow the
expected free-free spectrum. Instead there is a bump near 50 GHz, modifying the
spectrum at the 20% level, which we speculate is caused by spinning dust in the
warm ionized medium. 4. The derived cross-correlation spectra are not sensitive
to the map zero points, but are sensitive to the choice of CMB estimator. In
cases where the CMB estimator is derived by minimizing variance of a linear
combination of the WMAP bands, we show that a bias proportional to the
cross-correlation of each template and the true CMB is always present. This
bias can be larger than any of the foreground signals in some bands. 5. Lastly,
we consider the frequency coverage and sensitivity of the Planck mission, and
suggest linear combination coefficients for the CMB template that will reduce
both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the synchrotron and haze
spectra by more than an order of magnitude.

coincidence of any prompt EM counterpart with a gravitationally-timed merger
may offer the best chance of identifying a unique host galaxy. We discuss the
challenges posed by searches for prompt EM counterparts and propose novel
observational strategies to address them. In particular, we discuss the size
and shape evolution of the LISA localization error ellipses on the sky, and
quantify the requirements for dedicated EM surveys of the area prior to
coalescence. A triggered EM counterpart search campaign will require monitoring
a several-square degree area. It could aim for variability at the 24-27 mag
level in optical bands, for example, which corresponds to 1-10% of the
Eddington luminosity of the prime LISA sources of 10^6-10^7 Msun BHs at z=1-2,

with the quasi-periodic gravitational waveform over 10-1000 cycles may aid the
detection. Alternatively, EM searches can detect a transient signal
accompanying the coalescence. We highlight the measurement of differences in
the arrival times of photons and gravitons from the same cosmological source as
a valuable independent test of the massive character of gravity, and of
possible violations of Lorentz invariance in the gravity sector.

the radiometer equation can still be used in this regime because the weak

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies via three different fueling
mechanisms: major mergers, minor mergers, and disk instabilities. The SMBHs in
all three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental plane (BHFP) and
correlation with bulge binding energy seen in simulations of major mergers, and
observed locally. Furthermore, provided that the total gas supply is
significantly larger than the mass of the SMBH, its limiting mass is not
influenced by the amount of gas available or the efficiency of black hole
growth. This supports the assertion that SMBHs accrete until they reach a
critical mass at which feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally,
terminating the inflow and stalling further growth. At the same time, while
minor and major mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the
$M_{BH}-\sigma$ and Magorrian relations), SMBHs grown via disk instabilities do
not, owing to structural differences between the host bulges. This finding is
supported by recent observations of SMBHs in pseudobulges and bulges in barred
systems, as compared to those hosted by classical bulges. Taken together, this
provides support for the BHFP and binding energy correlations as being more
""fundamental"" than other proposed correlations in that they reflect the

http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1635v1,"Characterization of the tail of the distribution of earthquake
  magnitudes by combining the GEV and GPD descriptions of Extreme Value Theory","  We present a generic and powerful approach to study the statistics of extreme
phenomena (meteorology, finance, biology...) that we apply to the statistical
estimation of the tail of the distribution of earthquake sizes. The chief
innovation is to combine the two main limit theorems of Extreme Value Theory
(EVT) that allow us to derive the distribution of T-maxima (maximum magnitude
occurring in sequential time intervals of duration T) for arbitrary T. We
propose a method for the estimation of the unknown parameters involved in the
two limit theorems corresponding to the Generalized Extreme Value distribution
(GEV) and to the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). We establish the direct
relations between the parameters of these distributions, which permit to
evaluate the distribution of the T-maxima for arbitrary T. The duality between
the GEV and GPD provides a new way to check the consistency of the estimation
of the tail characteristics of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes for
earthquake occurring over arbitrary time interval. We develop several
procedures and check points to decrease the scatter of the estimates and to
verify their consistency. We test our full procedure on the global Harvard
catalog (1977-2006) and on the Fennoscandia catalog (1900-2005). For the global
catalog, we obtain the following estimates: Mmax = 9.53 +- 0.52;
quantile(0.97)==9.21 +- 0.20. For Fennoscandia, we obtain Mmax = 5.76 +- 0.165;
quantile(0.97) =5.44 +- 0.073. The estimates of all related parameters for the
GEV and GPD, including the most important form parameter, are also provided.

  background","  We develop a new method for reconstructing cluster mass profiles and
large-scale structure from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). By analyzing
the likelihood of CMB lensing, we analytically prove that standard quadratic
estimators for CMB lensing are unbiased and achieve the optimal condition only
in the limit of no lensing; they become progressively biased and sub-optimal,
when the lensing effect is large, especially for clusters that can be found by
ongoing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys. Adopting an alternative approach to the CMB
likelihood, we construct a new maximum likelihood estimator that utilizes
delensed CMB temperature fields based on an assumed model. We analytically show
that this estimator asymptotically approaches the optimal condition as our
assumed model is refined, and we numerically show that our estimator quickly
converges to the true model as we iteratively apply it to CMB maps. For
realistic CMB experiments, we demonstrate the applicability of the maximum
likelihood estimator with tests against numerical simulations in the presence
of CMB secondary contaminants. With significant improvement on the
signal-to-noise ratio, our new maximum likelihood estimator can be used to
measure the cluster-mass cross-correlation functions at different redshifts,
probing the evolution of dark energy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2899v2,Incidence Rate of GRB-host-DLAs at High Redshift,"  We study the incidence rate of damped Ly-a systems associated with the host
galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRB-host-DLAs) as functions of neutral hydrogen
column density (N_HI) and projected star formation rate (SFR) using
cosmological SPH simulations. Assuming that the occurrence of GRBs is
correlated with the local SFR, we find that the median N_HI of GRB-host-DLAs
progressively shifts to lower N_HI values with increasing redshift, and the
incidence rate of GRB-host-DLAs with log N_HI > 21.0 decreases rapidly at z>=6.
Our results suggest that the likelihood of observing the signature of IGM
attenuation in GRB afterglows increases towards higher redshift, because it
will not be blocked by the red damping wing of DLAs in the GRB host galaxies.
This enhances the prospects of using high-redshift GRBs to probe the
reionization history of the Universe. The overall incidence rate of
GRB-host-DLAs decreases monotonically with increasing redshift, whereas that of
QSO-DLAs increases up to z=6. A measurement of the difference between the two
incidence rates would enable an estimation of the value of \eta_grb, which is
the mass fraction of stars that become GRBs for a given amount of star

http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3974v2,Dissipation and the Fundamental Plane: Observational Tests,"  We develop observational tests of the idea that dissipation in gas-rich
mergers produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed by
ellipticals. The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratio
of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue
that mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger
mass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and
higher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic
imprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer
profile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In
previous work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed
profiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the
original spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of
observed ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its
tilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more
dissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed
degree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical
mass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed
FP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the
effects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as
disks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.
Dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt.

linearized FRW metric, we derive the gravitational lensing and the generalized
Sachs-Wolfe effects that include the weak lensing distortion, magnification,

compute their effects on observed source fluctuations, separating them as two
physically distinct origins: the volume effect that involves the change of
volume and is always present in galaxy two-point statistics, and the source
effect that depends on the intrinsic properties of source populations. Then we
identify several terms that are ignored in the standard method, and we compute
the observed galaxy two-point statistics, an ensemble average of all the

http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4262v2,Star Clusters Around Recoiled Black Holes in the Milky Way Halo,"  Gravitational wave emission by coalescing black holes (BHs) kicks the remnant
BH with a typical velocity of hundreds of km/s. This velocity is sufficiently
large to remove the remnant BH from a low-mass galaxy but is below the escape
velocity from the Milky Way (MW) galaxy. If central BHs were common in the
galactic building blocks that merged to make the MW, then numerous BHs that
were kicked out of low-mass galaxies should be freely floating in the MW halo
today. We use a large statistical sample of possible merger tree histories for
the MW to estimate the expected number of recoiled BH remnants present in the
MW halo today. We find that hundreds of BHs should remain bound to the MW halo
after leaving their parent low-mass galaxies. Each BH carries a compact cluster
of old stars that populated the core of its original host galaxy. Using the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation, we find that present-day clusters are ~<
1 pc in size, and their central bright regions should be unresolved in most
existing sky surveys. These compact systems are distinguishable from globular
clusters by their internal (Keplerian) velocity dispersion greater than one
hundred km/s and their high mass-to-light ratio owing to the central BH. An

of future millimeter VLBI arrays to constrain the spin and inclination of the

the context of radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We examine
the range of baseline visibility and closure amplitudes predicted by RIAF

find that baseline lengths near 3 gigalambda have the greatest power to
distinguish amongst RIAF model parameters, and that it will be important to
include new telescopes that will form north-south baselines with a range of
lengths. If a RIAF model describes the emission from Sgr A*, it is likely that
the orientation of the accretion disk can be determined with the addition of a
Chilean telescope to the array. Some likely disk orientations predict
detectable fluxes on baselines between the continental United States and even a

on the physics of low-mass objects. A wide variety of approaches are being
pursued, including eclipsing binary studies, astrometric-spectroscopic orbital

  Binary LMC X-4","  We present the first high-resolution X-ray study of emission line variability
with superorbital phase in the neutron star binary LMC X-4. Our analysis
provides new evidence from X-ray spectroscopy confirming accretion disk
precession as the origin of the superorbital period. The spectra, obtained with
the Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) and the
XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS), contain a number of emission
features, including lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like species of N, O,
Ne, and Fe, a narrow O VII RRC, and fluorescent emission from cold Fe. We use
the narrow RRC and the He-alpha triplets to constrain the temperature and
density of the (photoionized) gas. By comparing spectra from different
superorbital phases, we attempt to isolate the contributions to line emission
from the accretion disk and the stellar wind. There is also evidence for highly
ionized iron redshifted and blueshifted by ~25,000 km/s. We argue that this
emission originates in the inner accretion disk, and show that the emission
line properties in LMC X-4 are natural consequences of accretion disk
precession.

quantities in particle physics. In a recent experiment at Brookhaven it has
been measured with a remarkable 14-fold improvement of the previous CERN
experiment reaching a precision of 0.54ppm. Since the first results were
published, a persisting ""discrepancy"" between theory and experiment of about 3
standard deviations is observed. It is the largest ""established"" deviation from
the Standard Model seen in a ""clean"" electroweak observable and thus could be a
hint for New Physics to be around the corner. This deviation triggered numerous
speculations about the possible origin of the ""missing piece"" and the increased
experimental precision animated a multitude of new theoretical efforts which
lead to a substantial improvement of the prediction of the muon anomaly
a_mu=(g_mu-2)/2. The dominating uncertainty of the prediction, caused by strong
interaction effects, could be reduced substantially, due to new hadronic cross
section measurements in electron-positron annihilation at low energies. Also
the recent electron g-2 measurement at Harvard contributes substantially to the
progress in this field, as it allows for a much more precise determination of
the fine structure constant alpha as well as a cross check of the status of our
theoretical understanding.

spectroscopic binary system for which both the radial velocity orbit for the
primary and spectral types for both components have been determined. By
combining these measurements with predictions from four different sets of
evolutionary models, we determine a minimum age of 2.0+/-0.3 Gyr for this
system, corresponding to minimum primary and secondary masses of 0.080 Msun and
0.053 Msun, respectively. We find broad agreement in the inferred age and mass
constraints between the evolutionary models, including those that incorporate
atmospheric condensate grain opacity; however, we are not able to independently
assess their accuracy. The inferred minimum age agrees with the kinematics and
absence of magnetic activity in this system, but not the rapid rotation of its
primary, further evidence of a breakdown in angular momentum evolution trends
amongst the lowest luminosity stars. Assuming a maximum age of 10 Gyr, we
constrain the orbital inclination of this system to i >~ 53 degrees. More
precise constraints on the orbital inclination and/or component masses of 2MASS
J0320-0446AB, through either measurement of the secondary radial velocity orbit

(kSZ) effect. Unlike other Galactic foregrounds, the halo kSZ signature covers
the full sky, generates anisotropies on large angular scales, is not
accompanied by spectral distortions, and could therefore be confused with
primordial CMB anisotropies. We construct theoretical models for various halo
components, including smooth diffuse gas, filaments of cold inflowing gas and
high velocity clouds. We find that the kSZ effect for all components is above
the sensitivity of the Planck satellite, over a range of angular scales.
However, the typical halo contribution is well below the cosmic variance noise
in the primordial CMB power spectrum. High velocity clouds could dominate the
halo contribution and better observational data is required to mask them out.
We derive expected kSZ maps based on existing data from tracers of the halo gas
distribution, such as 21cm maps of neutral hydrogen and H_alpha maps of
recombining gas. The cross-correlation of these maps with the WMAP5 data does
not yield any statistically significant signal.

`laboratories' for studying the evolution of accretion disks and jet formation
in black-hole systems. Although studies of black holes have revealed a complex

formation remain a mystery. Here we report the discovery of a broad emission
line during periods of intense hard X-ray flux in the microquasar GRS 1915+105,
and highly ionized narrow absorption lines during softer states. We argue that
the broad emission line arises when the inner accretion disk is illuminated by
hard X-rays, possibly from the jet. In contrast, during softer states, when the
jet is weak or absent, absorption lines appear as the powerful radiation field
around the black hole drives a hot wind off the accretion disk. Our analysis
strongly suggests that this wind carries enough mass away from the disk to halt
the flow of matter into the radio jet.

We pay particular attention to the high-latitude part of the background that
could be confused with an extragalactic component in existing analyses that
subtract a Galactic cosmic-ray model. Our pulsar population models are
calibrated to the results of large-scale radio surveys and we employ a simple
empirical gamma-ray luminosity calibration to the spin-down rate that provides
a good fit to existing data. We find that while ordinary pulsars are expected
to contribute only a fraction ~10^-3 of the high-latitude gamma-ray intensity
(I_X~1x10^-5 ph s^-1 cm^-2 sr^-1), MSPs could provide a much larger
contribution and even potentially overproduce it, depending on the model
parameters. We explore these dependences using a range of MSP models as a guide
to how gamma-ray measurements can usefully constrain the MSP population.
Existing gamma-ray background measurements and source counts already rule out
several models. Finally, we show how fluctuations in the gamma-ray sky can be

the U_A(1) or chiral symmetry may temporarily be restored. As a consequence,
the mass of the eta'(958) mesons may be reduced to its quark model value, and
the abundance of eta' mesons at low p_T may be enhanced by more than a factor
of 10. The intercept parameter lambda_* of the charged pion Bose--Einstein
correlations provides a sensitive observable of the possibly enhanced eta'
abundance. We have analyzed lambda_*(m_T) data from sqrt(s(NN))=200 GeV central
Au+Au reactions measured at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC),
using extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on six popular models for
hadronic multiplicities. Based on the combined STAR and PHENIX data set, and on
various systematic investigations of resonance multiplicities and model
parameters, we conclude that in sqrt(s(NN))=200 GeV central Au+Au reactions the
mass of the eta' meson is reduced by Delta m > 200 MeV, at the 99.9% confidence
level in the considered model class. Such a significant eta' mass modification
may indicate the restoration of the U_A(1) symmetry in a hot and dense hadronic

http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2465v2,Large Late-time Asphericities in Three Type IIP Supernovae,"  Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe IIP) are the results of the explosions of red
supergiants and are the most common subclass of core-collapse supernovae. Past
observations have shown that the outer layers of the ejecta of SNe IIP are
largely spherical, but the degree of asphericity increases toward the core. We
present evidence for high degrees of asphericity in the inner cores of three
recent SNe IIP (SNe 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa), as revealed by late-time
optical spectropolarimetry. The three objects were all selected to have very
low interstellar polarization (ISP), which minimizes the uncertainties in ISP
removal and allows us to use the continuum polarization as a tracer of
asphericity. The three objects have intrinsic continuum polarizations in the
range of 0.83-1.56% in observations taken after the end of the photometric
plateau, with the polarization dropping to almost zero at the wavelengths of
strong emission lines. Our observations of SN 2007aa at earlier times, taken on
the photometric plateau, show contrastingly smaller continuum polarizations
(~0.1%). The late-time H-alpha and [O I] line profiles of SN 2006ov provide
further evidence for asphericities in the inner ejecta. Such high core
polarizations in very ordinary core-collapse supernovae provide further
evidence that essentially all core-collapse supernova explosions are highly
aspherical, even if the outer parts of the ejecta show only small deviations
from spherical symmetry.

the galactic and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and the implications
for the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i) some short
GRBs occur in elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short GRBs occur in
star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs are distinct
from the host galaxies of long GRBs in terms of star formation rates,
luminosities, and metallicities, and instead appear to be drawn from the
general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs
relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long
GRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution agrees well with predictions for the
locations of NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) unlike long GRBs, which tend to
occur in the brightest regions of their hosts, the environments of short GRBs
generally under-represent the light distribution of their host galaxies. Taken
together, these observations suggest that short GRB progenitors have a wide age
distribution and generally track stellar mass rather than star formation
activity. These results are fully consistent with NS-NS binary mergers, but
partial contribution from prompt or delayed magnetar formation is also
consistent with the data.

outbursts caused by accretion flares.Our result excludes the possibility of GM
Cep being a FUor, EXor, or McNeil's Nebula type star. Several special cases of

Cambridge in autumn 1998. They contain an exposition of the representation
theory of the Lie algebras of compact matrix groups, affine Kac-Moody algebras
and the Virasoro algebra from a unitary point of view. The treatment uses many
of the methods of conformal field theory, in particular the Goddard-Kent-Olive
construction and the Kazami-Suzuki supercharge operator, a generalisation of
the Dirac operator. The proof of the Weyl character formula is taken from
unpublished notes of Peter Goddard. The supersymmetric proof of the Kac
character formula for affine Kac-Moody algebras was also found independently at
roughly the same time by Greg Landweber in his Harvard Ph.D. dissertation. One
of the main novelties of this approach is a very rapid proof of the
Feigin-Fuchs character formula for the discrete series representations of the
Virasoro algebra. It relies only on the first part of the Friedan-Qiu-Shenker
unitarity theorem placing restrictions on the parameter h. Their result, which
only uses elementary properties of plane curves, is presented in detail in
these notes along with the somewhat harder result for c. A substantially
shorter treatment is possible if the final goal is just the Feigin-Fuchs
formula, since in that case only the representation theory of affine sl(2) is
needed (cf the MSRI summer course given in 2000,
http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/opal/wassermann/). The same
method has been applied by S. Palcoux to the Neveu-Schwarz algebra and also

contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best.
Individuals at the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner,
on average, than those at the periphery. However, mapping a whole network to
identify central individuals whom to monitor is typically very difficult. We
propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global
network structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected
individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether
such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu
outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided
between a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the
progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.
11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a
whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16
of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the
population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional
time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.
Moreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,
psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

accretion flow and then drives a wind from the outer disk, all in a bizarre
cycle that lasts fewer than 60 seconds but can repeat for weeks. We find that
the accretion disk wind may be sufficiently massive to play an active role in
GRS 1915+105, not only in quenching the jet on long timescales, but also in
possibly producing or facilitating transitions between classes of X-ray

galaxies at the same mass and redshift by $0.45\pm0.09$ dex. We also verify the
correlation between color and stellar mass density of galaxies to high
redshifts. The sizes of sub-mm galaxies in the same field are measured and

astrophysics, both for their significance for stellar evolution and for their
potential application as probes of strong gravity. In spite of extensive
surveys of our Galaxy and its system of globular clusters, no pulsar-black hole
(PSR-BH) binary has been found to date. Clues as to where such systems might
exist are therefore highly desirable. We show that if the central parsec around
Sgr A* harbors a cluster of ~25,000 stellar BHs (as predicted by mass
segregation arguments) and if it is also rich in recycled pulsar binaries (by
analogy with globular clusters), then 3-body exchange interactions should
produce PSR-BHs in the Galactic center. Simple estimates of the formation rate
and survival time of these binaries suggest that a few PSR-BHs should be
present in the central parsec today. The proposed formation mechanism makes
unique predictions for the PSR-BH properties: 1) the binary would reside within
~1 pc of Sgr A*; 2) the pulsar would be recycled, with a period of ~1 to a few
tens of milliseconds, and a low magnetic field B<~10^10 G; 3) the binary would
have high eccentricity, e~0.8, but with a large scatter; and 4) the binary
would be relatively wide, with semi-major axis a_b~0.1 - >~3 AU. The potential
discovery of a PSR-BH binary therefore provides a strong motivation for deep,
high-frequency radio searches for recycled pulsars toward the Galactic center.

detected in quasar microlensing and anomalous quasar radio brightening bursts.
The primordial planets often concentrate together to form a star, with residual
matter seen in pre-stellar accretion discs around the youngest stars.
  These primordial planet mass bodies were formed of hydrogen-helium,
aggregated in dense clumps of a trillion at the time of plasma neutralization
380,000 years after the big bang. Most have been frozen and invisible, but are
now manifesting themselves in numerous ways as sensitive modern space
telescopes become operational. Their key detection signature is their thermal

observations trace the afterglow evolution when the blastwave has decelerated
to mildly- or non-relativistic velocities and has roughly isotropized. We infer
beaming-independent kinetic energies using the Sedov-Taylor self-similar

7x10^51 erg, with a 90% confidence range of 1.1x10^50-3.3x10^53 erg. Both the

This is due to bursts in our sample with only a single-frequency observation

spectrum. This limitation leads to a wider range of allowed energies than for
bursts with a well-measured spectral peak. Our study indicates that
single-epoch centimeter-band observations covering the spectral peak on a

observed in roughly 50% of the afterglows. These X-ray flares range fluences

regards the internal shock scenario, interpreting the X-ray flares as late time

addition, the log-parabolic function is statistically favored with respect to
other proposed spectral models. By using a time resolved spectral analysis, we
show the evolution of the peak energy and the curvature parameters of the SED

the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random

an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of

a mechanism to form planetesimals. Dissipation from gas drag introduces secular
GI, which proceeds even when standard GI criteria for a critical density or
Toomre's $Q$ predict stability. We include the stabilizing effects of turbulent
diffusion, which suppresses small scale GI. The radially wide rings that do
collapse contain up to $\sim 0.1$ Earth masses of solids. Subsequent
fragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically
homogenous planetesimals. Particle radial drift time scales (and, to a lesser
extent, disk lifetimes and sizes) restrict the viability of secular GI to disks
with weak turbulent diffusion, characterized by $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$. Thus
midplane dead zones are a preferred environment. Large solids with radii
$\gtrsim 10$ cm collapse most rapidly because they partially decouple from the
gas disk. Smaller solids, even below $\sim$ mm-sizes could collapse if
particle-driven turbulence is weakened by either localized pressure maxima or
super-Solar metallicity. Comparison with simulations that include particle
clumping by the streaming instability shows that our linear model underpredicts
rapid, small scale gravitational collapse. Thus the inclusion of more detailed
gas dynamics promotes the formation of planetesimals. We discuss relevant
constraints from Solar System and accretion disk observations.

underlying H2 column density is a long-standing problem in astrophysics. While
the Galactic CO-H2 conversion factor (Xco) appears to be reasonably constant,
observations indicate that Xco may be depressed in high-surface density
starburst environments. Using a multi-scale approach, we investigate the
dependence of Xco on the galactic environment in numerical simulations of disc
galaxies and galaxy mergers. Xco is proportional to the GMC surface density
divided by the integrated CO intensity, Wco, and Wco is related to the kinetic
temperature and velocity dispersion in the cloud. In disc galaxies (except
within the central ~ kpc), the galactic environment is largely unimportant in
setting the physical properties of GMCs provided they are gravitationally
bound. The temperatures are roughly constant at ~10 K due to the balance of CO
cooling and cosmic ray heating, giving a nearly constant CO-H2 conversion
factor in discs. In mergers, the velocity dispersion of the gas rises
dramatically during coalescence. The gas temperature also rises as it couples
well to the warm (~50 K) dust at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^-3). The rise in
velocity dispersion and temperature combine to offset the rise in surface
density in mergers, causing Xco to drop by a factor of ~2-10 compared to the
disc simulation. This model predicts that high-resolution ALMA observations of
nearby ULIRGs should show velocity dispersions of ~10-100 km/s, and brightness
temperatures comparable to the dust temperatures.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4313v2,An Improved Forecast of Patchy Reionization Reconstruction with CMB,"  Inhomogeneous reionization gives rise to angular fluctuations in the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) optical depth tau(n) to the last scattering surface,
correlating different spherical harmonic modes and imprinting characteristic
non-Gaussianity on CMB maps. Recently the minimum variance quadratic estimator
has been derived using this mode-coupling signal, and found that the optical
depth fluctuations could be detected with (S/N)^2 ~ 100 in futuristic
experiments like CMBPol. We first demonstrate that the non-Gaussian signal from
gravitational lensing of CMB is the dominant source of contamination for
reconstructing inhomogeneous reionization signals, even with 98% of its
contribution removed by delensing. We then construct unbiased estimators that
simultaneously reconstruct inhomogeneous reionization signals tau(n) and
gravitational lensing potential phi(n). We apply our new unbiased estimators to
future CMB experiment to assess the detectability of inhomogeneous reionization
signals. With more physically motivated simulations of inhomogenuous
reionizations that predict an order of magnitude smaller optical depth power
spectrum than previous studies, we show that a CMBPol-like experiment could
achieve a marginal detection of inhomogeneous reionization,(S/N)^2 ~ O(1) with
this quadratic estimator to ~O(10) with the analogous maximum likelihood
estimator.

surveyed for water maser emission (123 detections and 3806 non-detections) with
the SDSS low-redshift galaxy sample (z<0.05). Out of 1636 galaxies with SDSS
photometry, we identify 48 detections; out of the 1063 galaxies that also have

is higher at higher optical luminosity (M_B), larger velocity dispersion
($\sigma$), and higher [OIII]5007 luminosity, with [OIII]5007 being the
dominant factor. These detection rates are essentially the result of the
correlations of isotropic maser luminosity with all three of these variables.
These correlations are natural if maser strength increases with central black
hole mass and the level of AGN activity. We also find that the detection rate
is higher in galaxies with higher extinction. Based on these results, we
propose that maser surveys seeking to efficiently find masers should rank AGN

prioritization would improve maser detection efficiency, from an overall ~ 3%

between the rate at which galaxies form stars and their X-Ray luminosity. We
combine this correlation with the most recent observational constraints on the
integrated star formation rate density, and find that star forming galaxies
account for 5-20% of the total soft and hard X-ray backgrounds, where the
precise number depends on the energy band and the assumed average X-ray
spectral energy distribution of the galaxies below ~20 keV. If we combine the
L_X-SFR relation with recently derived star formation rate function, then we
find that star forming galaxies whose X-ray flux falls well (more than a factor
of 10) below the detection thresholds of the Chandra Deep Fields, can fully
account for the unresolved soft X-ray background, which corresponds to ~6% of
its total. Motivated by this result, we put limits on the allowed redshift
evolution of the parameter c_X \equiv L_X/SFR, and/or its evolution towards
lower and higher star formation rates. If we parametrize the redshift evolution
of c_X ~ (1+z)^b, then we find that b \leq 1.3 (95% CL). On the other hand, the
observed X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of star forming galaxies indicate
that c_X may be increasing towards higher redshifts and/or higher star
formation rates at levels that are consistent with the X-ray background, but
possibly at odds with the locally observed L_X-SFR relation.

range from [Fe/H] from -2.9 to -3.9, including four new stars with [Fe/H]<-3.7.
We find four stars to be carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, confirming
the trend of increasing [C/Fe] abundance ratios with decreasing metallicity.
Two of these objects can be classified as CEMP-no stars, adding to the growing
number of these objects at [Fe/H]<-3. We also find four neutron-capture
enhanced stars in the sample, one of which has [Eu/Fe] of 0.8 with clear
r-process signatures. These pilot sample stars are the most metal-poor
([Fe/H]<-3.0) of the brightest stars included in CASH and are used to calibrate
a newly-developed, automated stellar parameter and abundance determination

We find that the pipeline results are statistically identical for snapshot

It brightened by about 1.5 magnitudes in B within a year starting in 1942, and

The mean brightness level was stable before and after the outburst, and
ellipsoidal variations with a period of $P=119.18\pm0.07$ days are seen,
suggesting that the star is tidally distorted. Radial-velocity measurements
indicate that the orbit is nearly circular ($e=0.02\pm0.01$) with a

there is no sign of emission lines or a stellar wind in the spectra. With an

correlation between rest-frame absorption equivalent width of MgII absorbers,
Wr(2796), and mean associated [OII] luminosity, L_[OII], in SDSS QSO spectra.
We demonstrate based on a Monte Carlo simulation that the observed Wr(2796) vs.
L_[OII] correlation of MgII absorbers can be well-reproduced, if all galaxies
found in deep surveys possess extended MgII halos and if the extent of MgII
halos scales proportionally with galaxy mass as shown in previous studies. The
observed correlation can be explained by a combination of (1) the known
Wr(2796) vs. rho anti-correlation in galaxy and MgII absorber pairs and (2) an
increasing aperture loss in the 3"" diameter SDSS fiber for galaxies at larger
rho. Galaxies at larger projected distances produce on average weaker MgII
absorbers and weaker (or zero) L_[OII] in SDSS QSO spectra. We show that such
correlation diminishes when larger fibers are adopted and is therefore not
physical. While under a simple halo model the majority of MgII absorbers do not
directly probe star-forming disks, they trace photo-ionized halo gas associated
with galaxies. We show that because of the scaling relation between extended

'clumps' in high-redshift, gas-rich galaxies. Such galactic disks are unstable
to the formation of bound gas-rich clumps whose properties initially depend
only on global disk properties, not the microphysics of feedback. In
simulations without stellar feedback, clumps turn an order-unity fraction of
their mass into stars and sink to the center, forming a large bulge and kicking
most of the stars out into a much more extended stellar envelope. By contrast,
strong radiative stellar feedback disrupts even the most massive clumps after
they turn ~10-20% of their mass into stars, in a timescale of ~10-100 Myr,
ejecting some material into a super-wind and recycling the rest of the gas into
the diffuse ISM. This suppresses the bulge formation rate by direct 'clump
coalescence' by a factor of several. However, the galactic disks do undergo
significant internal evolution in the absence of mergers: clumps form and
disrupt continuously and torque gas to the galactic center. The resulting
evolution is qualitatively similar to bar/spiral evolution in simulations with

which strongly suppressed star formation in some regions. This was estimated to
imprint a large-scale fluctuation signal of about 2 mK in the 21-cm spectral
line of atomic hydrogen associated with stars at a redshift of 20, although
this estimate ignored the critical contribution of gas heating due to X-rays
and major enhancements of the suppression. A large velocity difference reduces
the abundance of halos and requires the first stars to form in halos of about a
million solar masses, substantially greater than previously expected. Here we
report a simulation of the distribution of the first stars at z=20 (cosmic age
of ~180 Myr), incorporating all these ingredients within a 400 Mpc box. We find
that the 21-cm signature of these stars is an enhanced (10 mK) fluctuation
signal on the 100-Mpc scale, characterized by a flat power spectrum with
prominent baryon acoustic oscillations. The required sensitivity to see this
signal is achievable with an integration time of a thousand hours with an

http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1006v2,On the Mass Distribution and Birth Masses of Neutron Stars,"  We investigate the distribution of neutron star masses in different
populations of binaries, employing Bayesian statistical techniques. In
particular, we explore the differences in neutron star masses between sources
that have experienced distinct evolutionary paths and accretion episodes. We
find that the distribution of neutron star masses in non-recycled eclipsing
high-mass binaries as well as of slow pulsars, which are all believed to be
near their birth masses, has a mean of 1.28 M_solar and a dispersion of 0.24
M_solar. These values are consistent with expectations for neutron star
formation in core-collapse supernovae. On the other hand, double neutron stars,
which are also believed to be near their birth masses, have a much narrower
mass distribution, peaking at 1.33 M_solar but with a dispersion of only 0.05
M_solar. Such a small dispersion cannot easily be understood and perhaps points
to a particular and rare formation channel. The mass distribution of neutron
stars that have been recycled has a mean of 1.48 M_solar and a dispersion of
0.2 M_solar, consistent with the expectation that they have experienced
extended mass accretion episodes. The fact that only a very small fraction of
recycled neutron stars in the inferred distribution have masses that exceed ~2
M_solar suggests that only a few of these neutron stars cross the mass
threshold to form low mass black holes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0301v1,Radiation Pressure and Mass Ejection in Rho-like States of GRS 1915+105,"  We present a unifying scenario to address the physical origin of the
diversity of X-ray lightcurves within the rho variability class of the
microquasar GRS 1915+105. This 'heartbeat' state is characterized by a bright
flare that recurs every ~50-100 seconds, but the profile and duration of the
flares varies significantly from observation to observation. Based on a
comprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the RXTE archive, we
demonstrate that very different X-ray lightcurves do not require origins in
different accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the
phase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked
oscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray
spectral evolution. We argue that all heartbeat oscillations can be understood
as the result of a combination of a thermal-viscous radiation pressure
instability, a local Eddington limit in the disk, and a sudden,
radiation-pressure-driven evaporation or ejection event in the inner accretion
disk. This ejection appears to be a universal, fundamental part of the rho
state, and is largely responsible for a hard X-ray pulse seen in the lightcurve
of all cycles. We suggest that the detailed shape of oscillations in the mass
accretion rate through the disk is responsible for the phenomenological
differences between different rho-type lightcurves, and we discuss how future
time-dependent simulations of disk instabilities may provide new insights into
the role of radiation pressure in the accretion flow.

fragments into Earth-mass planets in trillion-planet
proto-globular-star-cluster (PGC) clumps at the 300 Kyr time of transition from
the plasma epoch, soon after the big bang. The first HGD stars formed from
pristine, frictionally-merging, gas-planets within the gently stressed clumps
of the early universe, burning most available lithium in brown-dwarfs and
hot-stars before creating metals that permit cooler burning. The Caffau halo
star is a present day example. CDM first stars (Population III) were massive
and promptly exploded, reionizing the gas of the universe and seeding it with
metals, thus making the observed star unexplainable. From HGD, CDM and its
massive first stars, and re-ionization by Pop III supernovae, never happened.
All stars are formed from planets in primordial clumps. HGD first stars (Pop
III) were small and long-lived, and the largest ones were hot. We suggest such
small HGD (Pop III) stars still form in the gently stressed Galaxy halo.

population in galactic nuclei. Stars crossing the line of site in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) produce a characteristic transit lightcurve, just like
extrasolar planets do when they transit their host star. We examine the
possibility of finding such AGN transits in deep optical, UV, and X-ray
surveys. We calculate transit lightcurves using the Novikov--Thorne thin
accretion disk model, including general relatistic effects. Based on the
expected properties of stellar cusps, we find that around 10^6 solar mass
SMBHs, transits of red giants are most common for stars on close orbits with
transit durations of a few weeks and orbital periods of a few years. We find
that detecting AGN transits requires repeated observations of thousands of low
mass AGNs to 1% photometric accuracy in optical, or ~ 10% in UV bands or soft
X-ray. It may be possible to identify stellar transits in the Pan-STARRS and
LSST optical and the eROSITA X-ray surveys. Such observations could be used to
constrain black hole mass, spin, inclination and accretion rate. Transit rates
and durations could give valuable information on the circumnuclear stellar
clusters as well. Transit lightcurves could be used to image accretion disks
with unprecedented resolution, allowing to resolve the SMBH silhouette in
distant AGNs.

dependent secondaries can be minimized by a multi-frequency analysis, we show
that even small degrees of patchiness can be detected at high significance. In
this case, we show that models with different values of tau_rms are

  spheroidals","  Self-Interacting Dark Matter is an attractive alternative to the Cold Dark
Matter paradigm only if it is able to substantially reduce the central
densities of dwarf-size haloes while keeping the densities and shapes of
cluster-size haloes within current constraints. Given the seemingly stringent
nature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a decade that SIDM would be
viable only if the cross section for self-scattering was strongly
velocity-dependent. However, it has recently been suggested that a constant
cross section per unit mass of sigma_T/m~0.1cm^2/g is sufficient to accomplish
the desired effect. We explicitly investigate this claim using high resolution
cosmological simulations of a Milky-Way size halo and find that, similarly to
the Cold Dark Matter case, such cross section produces a population of massive
subhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the classical dwarf
spheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of the mass profiles of
Fornax and Sculptor. This problem is resolved if sigma_T/m~1cm^2/g at the dwarf

Because of the strong magnetic field of one or both binary members and high
orbital frequencies, these binaries are strong sources of energy in the form of
Poynting flux (e.g., magnetic-field-dominated outflows, relativistic leptonic
winds, electromagnetic and plasma waves). The steady injection of energy by the
binary forms a bubble (or a cavity) filled with matter with the relativistic
equation of state, which pushes on the surrounding plasma and can drive a shock
wave in it. Unlike the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave solution for a
point-like explosion, the shock wave here is continuously driven by the
ever-increasing pressure inside the bubble. We calculate from the first
principles the dynamics and evolution of the bubble and the shock surrounding
it and predict that such systems can be observed as radio sources a few hours
before and after the merger. At much later times, the shock is expected to
settle onto the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution, thus resembling an

predictions of images, spectra, and lightcurves from the vicinities of compact
objects to observations. GRay can also perform on-the-fly ray tracing within
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic algorithms that simulate accretion
flows around compact objects. Making use of this algorithm, we calculate the
properties of the shadows of Kerr black holes and the photon rings that
surround them. We also provide accurate fitting formulae of their dependencies
on black hole spin and observer inclination, which can be used to interpret
upcoming observations of the black holes at the center of the Milky Way, as

http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0265v2,Why Your IT Project Might Be Riskier Than You Think,"  Out-of-control information technology (IT) projects have ended the careers of
top managers, such as EADS CEO Noel Forgeard and Levi Strauss' CIO David
Bergen. Moreover, IT projects have brought down whole companies, like Kmart in
the US and Auto Windscreen in the UK. Software and other IT is now such an
integral part of most business processes and products that CEOs must know their
IT risks, which are typically substantial and overlooked. The analysis of a
sample of 1,471 IT projects showed that the average cost overrun was 27% - but
that figure masks a far more alarming 'fat tail' risk. Fully one in six of the
projects in the sample was a Black Swan, with a cost overrun of 200%, on
average, and a schedule overrun of almost 70%. This highlights the true pitfall
of IT change initiatives: It's not that they're particularly prone to high cost
overruns on average - it is that there are a disproportionate number of Black
Swans. By focusing on averages instead of the more damaging outliers, most
managers and consultants have been missing the real risk in doing IT. In
conclusion, the article outlines ideas as to what can be done to avoid Black
Swans.

  Matrix with Application to State-Space Models","  Ionides, King et al. (see e.g. Inference for nonlinear dynamical systems,
PNAS 103) have recently introduced an original approach to perform maximum
likelihood parameter estimation in state-space models which only requires being
able to simulate the latent Markov model according to its prior distribution.
Their methodology relies on an approximation of the score vector for general
statistical models based upon an artificial posterior distribution and bypasses
the calculation of any derivative. We show here that this score estimator can
be derived from a simple application of Stein's lemma and how an additional
application of this lemma provides an original derivative-free estimator of the
observed information matrix. We establish that these estimators exhibit
robustness properties compared to finite difference estimators while their bias
and variance scale as well as finite difference type estimators, including
simultaneous perturbations (see e.g. Spall, IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control
37), with respect to the dimension of the parameter. For state-space models
where sequential Monte Carlo computation is required, these estimators can be
further improved. In this specific context, we derive original derivative-free
estimators of the score vector and observed information matrix which are
computed using sequential Monte Carlo approximations of smoothed additive
functionals associated with a modified version of the original state-space
model.

  explosions. Part II: Synthetic master events","  Waveform cross correlation is an efficient tool for detection and
characterization of seismic signals. The efficiency critically depends on the
availability of master events. For the purposes of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, cross correlation can globally reduce the threshold
monitoring by 0.3 to 0.4 magnitude units. In seismically active regions, the
optimal choice of master events is straightforward. There are two approaches to
populate the global grid in aseismic areas: the replication of real masters and
synthetic seismograms calculated for seismic arrays of the International
Monitoring System. Synthetic templates depend on the accuracy of shape and
amplitude predictions controlled by focal depth and mechanism, source function,
velocity structure and attenuation along the master/station path. As in Part I,
we test three focal mechanisms (explosion, thrust fault, and actual Harvard CMT
solution for one of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera aftershocks) and two velocity
structures (ak135 and CRUST 2.0). Sixteen synthetic master events were
distributed over a 1ox1o grid. We built five cross correlation standard event
lists (XSEL) and compared detections and events with those built using the real
and grand master events as well as with the Reviewed Event Bulletin of the
International Data Centre. The XSELs built using the source of explosion and
ak135 and the reverse fault with isotropic radiation pattern demonstrate the
performance similar to that of the real and grand masters. Therefore, it is
possible to cover all aseismic areas with synthetic masters without significant
loss in seismic monitoring capabilities based on cross correlation.

near-IR observations of the short-hard GRB130603B at z=0.356, which demonstrate
the presence of excess near-IR emission matching the expected brightness and
color of an r-process powered transient (a ""kilonova""). The early afterglow
fades rapidly with alpha<-2.6 at t~8-32 hr post-burst and has a spectral index
of beta=-1.5 (F_nu t^alpha*nu^beta), leading to an expected near-IR brightness
at the time of the first HST observation of m(F160W)>29.3 AB mag. Instead, the
detected source has m(F160W)=25.8+/-0.2 AB mag, corresponding to a rest-frame
absolute magnitude of M(J)=-15.2 mag. The upper limit in the HST optical
observations is m(F606W)>27.7 AB mag (3-sigma), indicating an unusually red
color of V-H>1.9 mag. Comparing the observed near-IR luminosity to theoretical
models of kilonovae produced by ejecta from the merger of an NS-NS or NS-BH
binary, we infer an ejecta mass of M_ej~0.03-0.08 Msun for v_ej=0.1-0.3c. The
inferred mass matches the expectations from numerical merger simulations. The
presence of a kilonova provides the strongest evidence to date that short GRBs
are produced by compact object mergers, and provides initial insight on the
ejected mass and the primary role that compact object merger may play in the
r-process. Equally important, it demonstrates that gravitational wave sources
detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo will be accompanied by optical/near-IR
counterparts with unusually red colors, detectable by existing and upcoming
large wide-field facilities (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DECam, Subaru, LSST).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2635v1,Viscous Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in highly ionised plasmas,"  Transport coefficients in highly ionised plasmas like the intra-cluster
medium (ICM) are still ill-constrained. They influence various processes, among
them the mixing at shear flow interfaces due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI). The observed structure of potential mixing layers can be
used to infer the transport coefficients, but the data interpretation requires
a detailed knowledge of the long-term evolution of the KHI under different
conditions. Here we present the first systematic numerical study of the effect
of constant and temperature-dependent isotropic viscosity over the full range
of possible values. We show that moderate viscosities slow down the growth of
the KHI and reduce the height of the KHI rolls and their rolling-up.
Viscosities above a critical value suppress the KHI. The effect can be
quantified in terms of the Reynolds number Re = U{\lambda}/{\nu}, where U is
the shear velocity, {\lambda} the perturbation length, and {\nu} the kinematic
viscosity. We derive the critical Re for constant and temperature dependent,
Spitzer-like viscosities, an empirical relation for the viscous KHI growth time
as a function of Re and density contrast, and describe special behaviours for
Spitzer-like viscosities and high density contrasts. Finally, we briefly
discuss several astrophysical situations where the viscous KHI could play a
role, i.e., sloshing cold fronts, gas stripping from galaxies, buoyant
cavities, ICM turbulence, and high velocity clouds.

fraction and 21 cm brightness temperature along the line of sight. Using a
novel method calibrated against radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we model
the neutral hydrogen density field and 21 cm signal in large volumes ($L = 2$
Gpc/$h$). The inclusion of the light cone effect leads to a relative decrease
of about 50% in the 21 cm power spectrum on all scales. We also find that the
effect is more prominent at the midpoint of reionization and later. The light
cone effect also can introduce an anisotropy along the line of sight. By
decomposing the 3D power spectrum into components perpendicular to and along
the line of sight, we find that in our fiducial reionization model, there is no
significant anisotropy. However, parallel modes can contribute up to 40% more
power for shorter reionization scenarios. The scales on which the light cone
effect is relevant are comparable to scales where one measures the baryon
acoustic oscillation. We argue that due to its large comoving scale and
introduction of anisotropy, the light cone effect is important when considering
redshift space distortions and future application to the Alcock-Paczynski test
for the determination of cosmological parameters.

association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae, their exclusive location in
star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright ultraviolet
regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on
theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (NS-NS or
NS-BH). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005, provided the first
insight into their energy scale and environments, established a cosmological
origin, a mix of host galaxy types, and an absence of associated supernovae. In
this review I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host galaxy
observations, and use this information to shed light on the nature and
properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the
relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The
preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors,
although some open questions remain. Based on this association, observations of
short GRBs and their afterglows can shed light on the on- and off-axis
electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced
LIGO/Virgo experiments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5471v1,Relativistic Reconnection: an Efficient Source of Non-Thermal Particles,"  In magnetized astrophysical outflows, the dissipation of field energy into
particle energy via magnetic reconnection is often invoked to explain the
observed non-thermal signatures. By means of two- and three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate anti-parallel reconnection in
magnetically-dominated electron-positron plasmas. Our simulations extend to
unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial scales, so we can capture the
asymptotic state of the system beyond the initial transients, and without any
artificial limitation by the boundary conditions. At late times, the
reconnection layer is organized into a chain of large magnetic islands
connected by thin X-lines. The plasmoid instability further fragments each
X-line into a series of smaller islands, separated by X-points. At the
X-points, the particles become unmagnetized and they get accelerated along the
reconnection electric field. We provide definitive evidence that the late-time
particle spectrum integrated over the whole reconnection region is a power-law,
whose slope is harder than -2 for magnetizations sigma>10. Efficient particle
acceleration to non-thermal energies is a generic by-product of the long-term
evolution of relativistic reconnection in both two and three dimensions. In
three dimensions, the drift-kink mode corrugates the reconnection layer at
early times, but the long-term evolution is controlled by the plasmoid
instability, that facilitates efficient particle acceleration, in analogy to
the two-dimensional physics. Our findings have important implications for the
generation of hard photon spectra in pulsar winds and relativistic
astrophysical jets.

the 21-cm transition of atomic hydrogen will show a clear fluctuation peak, at
a redshift and scale, respectively, that mark the central stage of reionization
and the characteristic size of ionized bubbles. This is based on the assumption
that the cosmic gas was heated by stellar remnants - particularly X-ray
binaries - to temperatures well above the cosmic microwave background at that

with more high-energy photons than low-energy photons) of X-ray binaries make
such heating ineffective, resulting in a delayed and spatially uniform heating
that modifies the 21-cm signature of reionization. Rather than looking for a
simple rise and fall of the large-scale fluctuations (peaking at several
millikelvin), we must expect a more complex signal also featuring a distinct
minimum (at less than a millikelvin) that marks the rise of the cosmic mean gas
temperature above the microwave background. Observing this signal, possibly
with radio telescopes in operation today, will demonstrate the presence of a
cosmic background of hard X-rays at that early time.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6550v2,Planet-disc interaction on a freely moving mesh,"  General-purpose, moving-mesh schemes for hydrodynamics have opened the
possibility of combining the accuracy of grid-based numerical methods with the
flexibility and automatic resolution adaptivity of particle-based methods. Due
to their supersonic nature, Keplerian accretion discs are in principle a very
attractive system for applying such freely moving mesh techniques. However, the
high degree of symmetry of simple accretion disc models can be difficult to
capture accurately by these methods, due to the generation of geometric grid
noise and associated numerical diffusion, which is absent in polar grids. To
explore these and other issues, in this work we study the idealized problem of
two-dimensional planet-disc interaction with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We
explore the hydrodynamic evolution of discs with planets through a series of
numerical experiments that vary the planet mass, the disc viscosity and the
mesh resolution, and compare the resulting surface density, vortensity field
and tidal torque with results from the literature. We find that the performance
of the moving-mesh code in this problem is in accordance with published
results, showing good consistency with grid codes written in polar coordinates.
We also conclude that grid noise and mesh distortions do not introduce
excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, we show how the moving-mesh approach
can naturally increase resolution in regions of high densityaround planets and
planetary wakes, while retaining the background flow at low resolution. This
provides an alternative to the difficult task of implementing adaptive mesh
refinement in conventional polar-coordinate codes.

imaging (DSI) schemes (e.g., USC-Harvard consortium). However, these data sets
are not readily accessible to high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)
analysis methods that are popular in connectomics analysis. Here we introduce a
scheme conversion approach that transforms multishell and DSI data into their
corresponding HARDI representations, thereby empowering HARDI-based analytical
methods to make use of data acquired using non-HARDI approaches. This method
was evaluated on both phantom and in-vivo human data sets by acquiring
multishell, DSI, and HARDI data simultaneously, and comparing the converted
HARDI, from non-HARDI methods, with the original HARDI data. Analysis on the
phantom shows that the converted HARDI from DSI and multishell data strongly
predicts the original HARDI (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Our in-vivo study
shows that the converted HARDI can be reconstructed by constrained spherical
deconvolution, and the fiber orientation distributions are consistent with
those from the original HARDI. We further illustrate that our scheme conversion
method can be applied to HCP data, and the converted HARDI do not appear to
sacrifice angular resolution. Thus this novel approach can benefit all
HARDI-based analysis approaches, allowing greater analytical accessibility to
non-HARDI data, including data from the HCP.

number (M<5) shocks in galaxy clusters and solar flares, but the electron
acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional (2D)
particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, we showed in Paper I that electrons
are efficiently accelerated in low Mach number (M=3) quasi-perpendicular shocks
via a Fermi-like process. The electrons bounce between the upstream region and
the shock front, with each reflection at the shock resulting in energy gain via
shock drift acceleration. The upstream scattering is provided by oblique
magnetic waves, that are self-generated by the electrons escaping ahead of the
shock. In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address
the nature of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated
by the shock-reflected electrons via the firehose instability, which is driven
by an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution. We systematically
explore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration
depend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or
equivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature. We find
that the mechanism works for shocks with high plasma beta (>20) at nearly all
magnetic field obliquities, and for electron temperatures in the range relevant
for galaxy clusters. Our findings offer a natural solution to the conflict

that result from stellar fly-bys. Although a small fraction of stars are
expected to undergo close approaches, the outcomes of the most violent
encounters might leave an imprint on the discs and host stars that will
influence both their orbits and their ability to form planets. We first
construct well-behaved 3-D models of self-gravitating discs, and then create a
suite of numerical experiments of parabolic encounters, exploring the effects
of pericenter separation r_p, disc orientation and disc-star mass ratio
(M_d/M_*) on the orbital evolution of the host stars. Close encounters (2r_p<~
disc radius) can truncate discs on very short time scales. If discs are
massive, close encounters facilitate enough orbital angular momentum extraction
to induce stellar capture. We find that for realistic primordial disc masses
M_d<~0.1M_*, non-colliding encounters induce minor orbital changes, which is
consistent with analytic calculations of encounters in the linear regime. The
same disc masses produce entirely different results for grazing/colliding
encounters. In the latter case, rapidly cooling discs lose orbital energy by
radiating away the energy excess of the shock-heated gas, thus causing capture
of the host stars into a bound orbit. In rare cases, a tight binary with a
circumbinary disc forms as a result of this encounter.

of a massive compact object at the galaxy's center. HVS ejected via the
disruption of stellar binaries can occasionally yield a star with $v_{\infty}

the velocities of these stars are so great that they can cross a significant
fraction of the observable universe in the time since their ejection (several
Gpc). We demonstrate that if a significant fraction of MBH mergers undergo a
phase in which their orbital eccentricity is $\gtrsim 0.5$ and their periapse
distance is tens of the primary's Schwarzschild radius, the space density of

the magnification maps have average variances across the best fit models

  gravitational lensing","  The observed properties of high redshift galaxies depend on the underlying
foreground distribution of large scale structure, which distorts their
intrinsic properties via gravitational lensing. We focus on the regime where
the dominant contribution originates from a single lens and examine the
statistics of gravitational lensing by a population of virialized and
non-virialized structures using sub-mm galaxies at z ~ 2.6 and Lyman-break
galaxies at redshifts z ~ 6 - 15 as the background sources. We quantify the
effect of lensing on the luminosity function of the high redshift sources,
focusing on the intermediate and small magnifications, mu < 2, which affect the
majority of the background galaxies, and comparing to the case of strong
lensing. We show that, depending on the intrinsic properties of the background
galaxies, gravitational lensing can significantly affect the observed
luminosity function even when no obvious strong lenses are present. Finally, we
find that in the case of the Lyman-break galaxies it is important to account
for the surface brightness profiles of both the foreground and the background
galaxies when computing the lensing statistics, which introduces a selection
criterion for the background galaxies that can actually be observed. Not taking
this criterion into account leads to an overestimation of the number densities
of very bright galaxies by nearly two orders of magnitude.

originally discovered with the INTEGRAL satellite: IGR J04059+5416 and IGR
J08297-4250. We use the Chandra X-ray Observatory to localize the sources and
then archival near-IR images to identify the counterparts. Both sources have
counterparts in the catalog of extended 2 Micron All-Sky Survey sources, and
the counterpart to IGR J04059+5416 has been previously identified as a galaxy.
Thus, we place IGR J04059+5416 in the class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
and we suggest that IGR J08297-4250 is also an AGN. If this identification is
correct, the near-IR images suggest that the host galaxy of IGR J08297-4250 may
be merging with a smaller nearby galaxy. For IGR J04059+5416, the 0.3-86 keV

with a column density of N_H = 3.1(+2.0)(-1.5)e22 cm-2 and a photon index of

highly absorbed (N_H = 6.1(+10.1)(-4.3)e23 cm-2).

produces a radio jet as a result of accretion, the jet precesses along a

this purpose we use the SSSEM to derive the CME and the shock kinematics.
Arrival times and speeds, inferred assuming either propagation at constant
speed or with uniform deceleration, show good agreement with Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE) measurements. The shock standoff distance
$[\Delta]$, the density compression $[\frac{\rho_d}{\rho_u}]$ and the Mach
number $[M]$ are calculated combining the results obtained for the CME and
shock kinematics with models for the shock location. Their values are
extrapolated to $\textrm{L}_1$ and compared to in-situ data. The in-situ
standoff distance is obtained from ACE solar-wind measurements, and the Mach
number and compression ratio are provided by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics interplanetary shock database. They are $\frac{\rho_d}{\rho_u}

  Testing a Persistent Idea","  The solar chromosphere contains thin, highly dynamic strands of plasma known
as spicules. Recently, it has been suggested that the smallest and fastest
(Type II) spicules are identical to intermittent jets observed by the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph. These jets appear to expand out along open
magnetic field lines rooted in unipolar network regions of coronal holes. In
this paper we revisit a thirty-year-old idea that spicules may be caused by
upward forces associated with Alfven waves. These forces involve the conversion
of transverse Alfven waves into compressive acoustic-like waves that steepen
into shocks. The repeated buffeting due to upward shock propagation causes
nonthermal expansion of the chromosphere and a transient levitation of the
transition region. Some older models of wave-driven spicules assumed sinusoidal
wave inputs, but the solar atmosphere is highly turbulent and stochastic. Thus,
we model this process using the output of a time-dependent simulation of
reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting mode-converted
compressive waves are strongly variable in time, with a higher transition
region occurring when the amplitudes are large and a lower transition region
when the amplitudes are small. In this picture, the transition region bobs up
and down by several Mm on timescales less than a minute. These motions produce
narrow, intermittent extensions of the chromosphere that have similar
properties as the observed jets and Type II spicules.

consider two effects that may have important ramifications for the development
of life in similar systems where a pair of planets may reside entirely in the
habitable zone of the hosting star. Specifically, we run numerical simulations
to determine whether strong, resonant (or non-resonant) planet-planet
interactions can cause large variations in planet obliquity---thereby inducing
large variations in climate. We also determine whether or not resonant
interactions affect the rate of lithopanspermia between the planet pair---which
could facilitate the growth and maintenance of life on both planets. We find
that first-order resonances do not cause larger obliquity variations compared
with non-resonant cases. We also find that resonant interactions are not a
primary consideration in lithopanspermia. Lithopanspermia is enhanced
significantly as the planet orbits come closer together---reaching nearly the
same rate as ejected material falling back to the surface of the originating
planet (assuming that the ejected material makes it out to the location of our
initial conditions). Thus, in both cases our results indicate that
close-proximity planet pairs in multihabitable systems are conducive to life in
the system.

rotated, ultracold Fermi gases. These superfluids can be described in terms of
an effective field theory for a macroscopic wave function representing the
field of condensed pairs, analogous to the Ginzburg-Landau theory for
superconductors. Here, we have established how rotation modifies this effective
field theory, by rederiving it starting from the action of Fermi gas in the
rotating frame of reference. The rotation leads to the appearance of an
effective vector potential, and the coupling strength of this vector potential
to the macroscopic wave function depends on the interaction strength between
the fermions, due to a renormalization of the pair effective mass in the
effective field theory. The mass renormalization derived here is in agreement
with results of functional renormalization group theory. In the extreme BEC
regime, the pair effective mass tends to twice the fermion mass, in agreement
with the physical picture of a weakly interacting Bose gas of molecular pairs.
Then, we use our macroscopic wave function description to study vortices and
the critical rotation frequencies to form them. Equilibrium vortex state
diagrams are derived, and they are in good agreement with available results of
the Bogoliubov - De Gennes theory and with experimental data.

tidally disrupted. Previous studies of such ""tidal disruption event"" (TDE)
mostly focus on the stellar debris that are bound to the system, because they
give rise to luminous flares. On the other hand, half of the stellar debris in
principle are unbound and can stream to a great distance, but so far there is
no clear evidence that this ""unbound debris stream"" (UDS) exists. Motivated by
the fact that the circum-nuclear region around SMBHs is usually filled with
dense molecular clouds (MCs), here we investigate the observational signatures
resulting from the collision between an UDS and a MC, which is likely to happen
hundreds of years after a TDE. We focus on $\gamma$-ray emission ($0.1-10^5$
GeV), which comes from the encounter of shock-accelerated cosmic rays with
background protons and, more importantly, is not subject to extinction. We show
that because of the high proton density inside a MC, the peak $\gamma$-ray
luminosity, about $10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, is at least $100$ times greater
than that in the case without a MC (only with a smooth interstellar medium).
The luminosity decays on a time-scale of decades, depending on the distance of
the MC, and about a dozen of these ""TDE afterglows"" could be detected within a
distance of about $16$ Mpc by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. Without
careful discrimination, these sources potentially could contaminate the
searches for starburt galaxies, galactic nuclei containing millisecond pulsars

$M\sim10^7M_{\odot}$, as well as a flattening of the gas density profiles in
the inner regions of haloes. We further identify and study the formation, in

corresponds to a simple permutation of the lattice sites. Hence, the method is
Lagrangian, conservative, and fully time-reversible. IL complements other
existing methods, such as N-body/particle mesh (computationally efficient, but
affected by Monte-Carlo sampling noise and two-body relaxation) and finite
volume (FV) direct integration schemes (expensive, accurate but diffusive). We
also present improvements to the FV scheme, using a moving mesh approach
inspired by IL, to reduce numerical diffusion and the time-step criterion.
Being a direct integration scheme like FV, IL is memory limited (memory
requirement for a full 3D problem scales as N^6, where N is the resolution per
linear phase-space dimension). However, we describe a new technique for
achieving N^4 scaling. The method offers promise for investigating the full 6D
phase-space of collisionless systems of stars and dark matter.

  magneto-gravo-turbulence","  Star formation in our Galaxy occurs in molecular clouds that are
self-gravitating, highly turbulent, and magnetized. We study the conditions
under which cloud cores inherit large-scale magnetic field morphologies and how
the field is governed by cloud turbulence. We present four moving-mesh
simulations of supersonic, turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas with a
range of magnetic mean-field strengths characterized by the Alfv\'enic Mach
number $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}$, resolving pre-stellar core formation from
parsec to a few AU scales. In our simulations with the turbulent kinetic energy
density dominating over magnetic pressure ($\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}>1$), we
find that the collapse is approximately isotropic with $B\propto\rho^{2/3}$,
core properties are similar regardless of initial mean-field strength, and the
field direction on $100$ AU scales is uncorrelated with the mean field.
However, in the case of a dominant large-scale magnetic field
($\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}=0.35$), the collapse is anisotropic with
$B\propto\rho^{1/2}$. This transition at $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}\sim1$ is not
expected to be sharp, but clearly signifies two different paths for magnetic
field evolution in star formation. Based on observations of different star
forming regions, we conclude that star formation in the interstellar medium may
occur in both regimes. Magnetic field correlation with the mean-field extends
to smaller scales as $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}$ decreases, making future ALMA
observations useful for constraining $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}$ of the

  Stars","  Approximately once every $10^4$ years, a star passes close enough to the
supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way to be pulled
apart by the black hole's tidal forces. The star is then ""spaghettified"" into a
long stream of matter, with approximately one half being bound to Sgr A* and
the other half unbound. Within this stream, the local self-gravity dominates
the tidal field of Sgr A*, which at minimum restricts the stream to a small
finite width. As the stream cools from adiabatic expansion and begins to
recombine, the residual self-gravity allows for planetary-mass fragments to
form along the length of the stream; these fragments are then shot out into the
galaxy at range of velocities, with the fastest moving at ~10% c. We determine
the phase space distributions of these fragments for a realistic ensemble of
stellar disruptions, along with the local density of fragments in the solar
neighborhood. We find that ~$10^7$ fragments produced by Sgr A* accumulate
within the Milky Way over its lifetime, that there are ~$10^7$ fragments that
lie within 1 Mpc of the Milky Way originating from other galaxies, and that the

  on Social Networks","  No man is an island, as individuals interact and influence one another daily
in our society. When social influence takes place in experiments on a
population of interconnected individuals, the treatment on a unit may affect
the outcomes of other units, a phenomenon known as interference. This thesis
develops a causal framework and inference methodology for experiments where
interference takes place on a network of influence (i.e. network interference).
In this framework, the network potential outcomes serve as the key quantity and
flexible building blocks for causal estimands that represent a variety of
primary, peer, and total treatment effects. These causal estimands are
estimated via principled Bayesian imputation of missing outcomes. The theory on
the unconfoundedness assumptions leading to simplified imputation highlights
the importance of including relevant network covariates in the potential
outcome model. Additionally, experimental designs that result in balanced
covariates and sizes across treatment exposure groups further improve the
causal estimate, especially by mitigating potential outcome model
mis-specification. The true potential outcome model is not typically known in
real-world experiments, so the best practice is to account for interference and
confounding network covariates through both balanced designs and model-based
imputation. A full factorial simulated experiment is formulated to demonstrate
this principle by comparing performance across different randomization schemes
during the design phase and estimators during the analysis phase, under varying
network topology and true potential outcome models. Overall, this thesis
asserts that interference is not just a nuisance for analysis but rather an
opportunity for quantifying and leveraging peer effects in real-world
experiments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08719v1,Better together? Statistical learning in models made of modules,"  In modern applications, statisticians are faced with integrating
heterogeneous data modalities relevant for an inference, prediction, or
decision problem. In such circumstances, it is convenient to use a graphical
model to represent the statistical dependencies, via a set of connected
""modules"", each relating to a specific data modality, and drawing on specific
domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the
conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty
quantification and information propagation through and across the modules.
However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update
of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when
certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to
avoid learning with the full model in favor of approaches that restrict the
information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation
to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we
investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model
in misspecified settings. We propose principled criteria to choose between
modular and full-model approaches. The question arises in many applied
settings, including large stochastic dynamical systems, meta-analysis,
epidemiological models, air pollution models,
pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, and causal inference with propensity scores.

how to retain metastably hydrogenous materials made at high pressure P on
release to ambient. Ultracondensed metallic hydrogen has been made at 140 GPa
at finite temperatures T in the fluid. The term metallic here means quantum
mechanically degenerate. A single sample of ultracondensed hydrogen has been
made at an estimated pressure of 495 GPa at 5.5 K. Whether that sample is solid
or fluid remains to be determined. Those results imply the long quest for
metallic hydrogen is likely to be concluded in the relatively near future.
Because the quest for metallic hydrogen has been a major driver of high
pressure research for decades, a logical question is whether another research
direction, comparable in scale to that quest, will arise in high pressure
research in the future.
  One possibility is retention of metastable solid metallic hydrogen and other
hydrogenous materials on release of P and T to ambient. If hydrogenous
materials could be retained metastably in the solid on release, those materials
would be a new class of materials for scientific investigations and
technological applications. This paper is a brief review of the synthesis of
metallic hydrogen, potential technological applications of metastable solid
metallic H and other hydrogenous materials at ambient, and published
experimental and theoretical results as general background for what has been
accomplished with metastable phases in the past, which suggests what might be
accomplished in the future.

explicit and implicit numerical schemes of ohmic resistivity terms in the
moving-mesh code AREPO. We include these non-ideal terms for two MHD
techniques: the Powell 8-wave formalism and a constrained transport scheme,
which evolves the cell-centred magnetic vector potential. We test our
implementation against problems of increasing complexity, such as one- and
two-dimensional diffusion problems, and the evolution of progressive and
stationary Alfv\'en waves. On these test problems, our implementation recovers
the analytic solutions to second-order accuracy. As first applications, we
investigate the tearing instability in magnetized plasmas and the gravitational
collapse of a rotating magnetized gas cloud. In both systems, resistivity plays
a key role. In the former case, it allows for the development of the tearing
instability through reconnection of the magnetic field lines. In the latter,
the adopted (constant) value of ohmic resistivity has an impact on both the gas
distribution around the emerging protostar and the mass loading of magnetically
driven outflows. Our new non-ideal MHD implementation opens up the possibility
to study magneto-hydrodynamical systems on a moving mesh beyond the ideal MHD
approximation.

Bose-Einstein condensate under self-gravity with a 3D wave function. As
$\hbar/m\to 0$, $m$ being the boson mass, the equations have been postulated to
approximate the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson equations also known as the
collisionless Boltzmann-Poisson equations. The latter describe collisionless
matter with a 6D classical distribution function. We investigate the nature of
this correspondence with a suite of numerical test problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D
along with analytic treatments when possible. We demonstrate that, while the
density field of the superfluid always shows order unity oscillations as
$\hbar/m\to 0$ due to interference and the uncertainty principle, the potential
field converges to the classical answer as $(\hbar/m)^{2}$. Thus, any dynamics
coupled to the superfluid potential is expected to recover the classical
collisionless limit as $\hbar/m\to 0$. The quantum superfluid is able to
capture rich phenomena such as multiple phase-sheets, shell-crossings, and warm
distributions. Additionally, the quantum pressure tensor acts as a regularizer
of caustics and singularities in classical solutions. This suggests the
exciting prospect of using the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations as a low-memory
method for approximating the high-dimensional evolution of the Vlasov-Poisson
equations. As a particular example we consider dark matter composed of
ultra-light axions, which in the classical limit ($\hbar/m\to 0$) is expected
to manifest itself as collisionless cold dark matter.

accretion outbursts occurring at intermittent cadence of months/years (EXors)
and decades/centuries (FUors). Variations that can be ascribed to a variable
extinction along their line of sight are instead classified as UXors. We aim at
investigating the long-term photometric behaviour of three sources classified
as eruptive variables. We present data from the archival plates of the Asiago
Observatory relative to the fields where the targets are located. For the sake
of completeness we have also analysed the Harvard plates of the same regions
that cover a much longer historical period, albeit at a lower sensitivity,

were investigated, providing a total of more than 200 magnitudes for the three

compared our data with more recently collected literature data. Our plates
analysis of V2492 Cyg provides historical upper limits that seem not to be
compatible with the level of the activity monitored during the last decade.
Therefore, recently observed accretion phenomena could be associated with the
outbursting episodes, more than repetitive obscuration. While a pure extinction
does not seem the only mechanism responsible for the ASASSN-15qi fluctuations,
it can account quite reasonably for the recent V350 Cep variations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08060v2,Shadows of spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities,"  We compare shadows cast by Schwarzschild black holes with those produced by
two classes of naked singularities that result from gravitational collapse of
spherically symmetric matter. The latter models consist of an interior naked
singularity spacetime restricted to radii $r\leq R_b$, matched to Schwarzschild
spacetime outside the boundary radius $R_b$. While a black hole always has a
photon sphere and always casts a shadow, we find that the naked singularity
models have photon spheres only if a certain parameter $M_0$ that characterizes
these models satisfies $M_0\geq 2/3$, or equivalently, if $R_b\leq 3M$, where
$M$ is the total mass of the object. Such models do produce shadows. However,
models with $M_0<2/3$ (or $R_b>3M$) have no photon sphere and do not produce a
shadow. Instead, they produce an interesting `full-moon' image. These results
imply that the presence of a shadow does not by itself prove that a compact
object is necessarily a black hole. The object could be a naked singularity
with $M_0\geq 2/3$, and we will need other observational clues to distinguish
the two possibilities. On the other hand, the presence of a full-moon image
would certainly rule out a black hole and might suggest a naked singularity
with $M_0<2/3$. It would be worthwhile to generalize the present study, which
is restricted to spherically symmetric models, to rotating black holes and
naked singularities.

function, suitably modified for moving meshes, is then used to solve the

coordinates from estimates of the interatomic distances, which maintains the
positions of the atoms in a known rigid substructure. Given an $M \times 3$
matrix of coordinates for the rigid substructure $\mathbf X$, this problem
consists of finding the $N \times 3$ matrix $\mathbf Y$ that yields of global
minimum of the so-called STRAIN, i.e. \[ \min_{\mathbf Y} \left\|
\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{XX}^\top & \mathbf{XY}^\top \\ \mathbf{YX}^\top &
\mathbf{YY}^\top \end{bmatrix} \,-\, \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf A & \mathbf B \\
\mathbf B^\top & \mathbf C \end{bmatrix} \right\|_{\mathsf F}^2 ~, \] where
$\mathbf A = \mathbf{XX}^\top$ , and $\mathbf B, \mathbf C$ are matrices of
inner products calculated from the estimated distances.
  The vanishing of the gradient of the STRAIN is shown to be equivalent to a
system of only six nonlinear equations in six unknowns for the inertial tensor
associated with the solution Y . The entire solution space is characterized in
terms of the geometry of the intersection curves between the unit sphere and
certain variable ellipsoids. Upon deriving tight bilateral bounds on the
moments of inertia of any possible solution, we construct a search procedure

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04521v1,Simulating galactic dust grain evolution on a moving mesh,"  Interstellar dust is an important component of the galactic ecosystem,
playing a key role in multiple galaxy formation processes. We present a novel
numerical framework for the dynamics and size evolution of dust grains
implemented in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO suited for cosmological
galaxy formation simulations. We employ a particle-based method for dust
subject to dynamical forces including drag and gravity. The drag force is
implemented using a second-order semi-implicit integrator and validated using
several dust-hydrodynamical test problems. Each dust particle has a grain size
distribution, describing the local abundance of grains of different sizes. The
grain size distribution is discretised with a second-order piecewise linear
method and evolves in time according to various dust physical processes,
including accretion, sputtering, shattering, and coagulation. We present a
novel scheme for stochastically forming dust during stellar evolution and new
methods for sub-cycling of dust physics time-steps. Using this model, we
simulate an isolated disc galaxy to study the impact of dust physical processes
that shape the interstellar grain size distribution. We demonstrate, for
example, how dust shattering shifts the grain size distribution to smaller
sizes resulting in a significant rise of radiation extinction from optical to
near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Our framework for simulating dust and gas
mixtures can readily be extended to account for other dynamical processes
relevant in galaxy formation, like magnetohydrodynamics, radiation pressure,
and thermo-chemical processes.

which is a possible pulsar wind nebula with a complex X-ray morphology and a
likely radio counterpart. With the superb angular resolution of Chandra, we
find evidence that a portion of the extended emission may be related to a bow
shock due to the putative pulsar moving through the interstellar medium. The
inferred direction of motion is consistent with IGR J11014-6103 having been
born in the event that produced the supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 11-61A. If this
association is correct, then previous constraints on the expansion of MSH
11-61A imply a transverse velocity for IGR J11014-6103 of 2,400-2,900 km/s,
depending on the SNR model used. This would surpass the kick velocities of any
known pulsars and rival or surpass the velocities of any compact objects that
are associated with SNRs. While it is important to confirm the nature of the
source, our radio pulsation search did not yield a detection.

sungrazers discovered from the ground in the 20th century. The central issue is
to appraise the pros and cons of a possibility that this object is --- despite

http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02034v1,Relativistic Shocks: Particle Acceleration and Magnetization,"  We review the physics of relativistic shocks, which are often invoked as the
sources of non-thermal particles in pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets, and as possible sources
of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays. We focus on particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation, and describe the recent progress in the field driven
by theory advances and by the rapid development of particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. In weakly magnetized or quasi parallel-shocks (where the magnetic
field is nearly aligned with the flow), particle acceleration is efficient. The
accelerated particles stream ahead of the shock, where they generate strong
magnetic waves which in turn scatter the particles back and forth across the
shock, mediating their acceleration. In contrast, in strongly magnetized
quasi-perpendicular shocks, the efficiencies of both particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation are suppressed. Particle acceleration, when
efficient, modifies the turbulence around the shock on a long time scale, and
the accelerated particles have a characteristic energy spectral index of ~ 2.2
in the ultra-relativistic limit. We discuss how this novel understanding of
particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in relativistic shocks can
be applied to high-energy astrophysical phenomena, with an emphasis on PWNe and
GRB afterglows.

low resolution fluxed spectroscopy. The evolution was normal and no late-time
`echo' outbursts were observed. The absolute integrated flux of emission lines
kept declining along the superoutburst, and their increasing contrast with the
underlying continuum was simply the result of the faster decline of the
continuum compared to the emission lines. Inspection of historical Harvard
plates covering the 1899-1981 period did not reveal previous outbursts, neither
`normal' nor 'super'. We discovered an extended emission nebula (radius ~1

http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03043v2,SETI via Leakage from Light Sails in Exoplanetary Systems,"  The primary challenge of rocket propulsion is the burden of needing to
accelerate the spacecraft's own fuel, resulting in only a logarithmic gain in
maximum speed as propellant is added to the spacecraft. Light sails offer an
attractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with
acceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially
illuminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by
the area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the
accelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail
propulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be
detectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave
beam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around
a single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz.
Leakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and
durations of tens of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary
system would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system,
multiply-transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of
detection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed
from Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly
employed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of
nearby transiting exoplanetary systems. The expected signal properties define a
new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

electron scattering, $\tau$, limits precision measurements of cosmological
parameters from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). It was recently shown
that the predicted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen contains enough information
to reconstruct $\tau$ with sub-percent accuracy, assuming that the neutral gas
was much hotter than the CMB throughout the entire epoch of reionization. Here
we relax this assumption and use the global 21-cm signal alone to extract
$\tau$ for realistic X-ray heating scenarios. We test our model-independent
approach using mock data for a wide range of ionization and heating histories
and show that an accurate measurement of the reionization optical depth at a
sub-percent level is possible in most of the considered scenarios even when
heating is not saturated during the epoch of reionization, assuming that the
foregrounds are mitigated. However, we find that in cases where heating sources
had hard X-ray spectra and their luminosity was close to or lower than what is
predicted based on low-redshift observations, the global 21-cm signal alone is
not a good tracer of the reionization history.

collapse of a pristine gas cloud directly into a massive, M_BH=10^4-10^6 M_sun
black hole. In this paper we show that large HI column densities of primordial
gas at T~10^4 K with low molecular abundance - which represent key aspects of
the DCBH scenario - provide optimal conditions for pumping of the 2p-level of
atomic hydrogen by trapped Lyman alpha (Lya) photons. This Lya pumping
mechanism gives rise to inverted level population of the 2s_1/2-2p_3/2
transition, and therefore to stimulated fine structure emission at 3.04 cm
(rest-frame). We show that simplified models of the DCBH scenario amplify the
CMB by up to a factor of 10^5, above which the maser saturates. Hyperfine
splitting of the 3-cm transition gives rise to a characteristic broad (FWHM ~
tens of MHz in the observers frame) asymmetric line profile. This signal
subtends an angular scale of ~ 1-10 mas, which translates to a flux of ~ 0.3-3

that a detection of the redshifted 3-cm emission line would provide direct
evidence for the DCBH scenario.

  Classroom","  A.V. Usova (1921-2014) has always been one of the leading figures in Russian
physics education. Her theory of physics concept formation was formulated
during the 1970s and the 1980s and directly influenced the process of physics
education in the 20th and the 21st century. Over the years there have been a
lot of theories of concept formation. Her work contributed to our understanding
of concept formation (learning, teaching) and the contemporary physics learning
process. She formulated her original views on the problem of concept formation
independently of Western researchers. She is perhaps the most important Russian
educational theorist in the field of concept learning. A.V. Usova suggested to
physics teachers the model of concept formation that describes: methods of
learning concept in physics classroom, conditions of successful concept
formation in physics teaching; structure of complex scientific concepts
formation (stages of concept formation), the influence of interdisciplinary
teaching on the scientific concept formation, criteria and levels of physics
concept formation, methods and techniques of analysis of the quality of concept
formation, the role of educational observation and experimentation in the
scientific concepts formation, methodology formation for complex physics
concepts ""work"" and ""energy"". This paper deals with both the historical A.V.

different emission mechanisms. These processes range from thermal and quiescent
to eruptive phenomena, such as shock waves and particle beams. We present a new
synthetic radio imaging tool that calculates and visualizes the Bremsstrahlung
radio emission. This tool works concurrently with state-of-the-art
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona using the code
BATS-R-US. Our model produces results that are in good agreement with both high
and low frequency observations of the solar disk. In this study, a ray-tracing
algorithm is used and the radio intensity is computed along the actual curved
ray trajectories. We illustrate the importance of refraction in locating the
radio emitting source by comparison of the radio imaging illustrations when the
line-of-sight instead of the refracted paths are considered. We are planning to
incorporate non-thermal radio emission mechanisms in a future version of the
radio imaging tool.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04440v1,New Vistas to study Bhartrhari: Cognitive NLP,"  The Sanskrit grammatical tradition which has commenced with Panini's
Astadhyayi mostly as a Padasastra has culminated as a Vakyasastra, at the hands
of Bhartrhari. The grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari and his authoritative work
'Vakyapadiya' have been a matter of study for modern scholars, at least for
more than 50 years, since Ashok Aklujkar submitted his Ph.D. dissertation at
Harvard University. The notions of a sentence and a word as a meaningful
linguistic unit in the language have been a subject matter for the discussion
in many works that followed later on. While some scholars have applied
philological techniques to critically establish the text of the works of
Bhartrhari, some others have devoted themselves to exploring philosophical
insights from them. Some others have studied his works from the point of view
of modern linguistics, and psychology. Few others have tried to justify the
views by logical discussions.
  In this paper, we present a fresh view to study Bhartrhari, and his works,
especially the 'Vakyapadiya'. This view is from the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP), more specifically, what is called as Cognitive NLP. We have
studied the definitions of a sentence given by Bhartrhari at the beginning of
the second chapter of 'Vakyapadiya'. We have researched one of these
definitions by conducting an experiment and following the methodology of
silent-reading of Sanskrit paragraphs. We collect the Gaze-behavior data of
participants and analyze it to understand the underlying comprehension
procedure in the human mind and present our results. We evaluate the
statistical significance of our results using T-test, and discuss the caveats
of our work. We also present some general remarks on this experiment and
usefulness of this method for gaining more insights in the work of Bhartrhari.

  eccentric orbits","  Using the astrometry from the ESA's Gaia mission, previous works have shown
that the Milky Way stellar halo is dominated by metal-rich stars on highly
eccentric orbits. To shed light on the nature of this prominent halo component,
we have analysed 28 Galaxy analogues in the Auriga suite of cosmological
hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations. Some three quarters of the Auriga galaxies
contain significant components with high radial velocity anisotropy, beta >
0.6. However, only in one third of the hosts do the high-beta stars contribute
significantly to the accreted stellar halo overall, similar to what is observed
in the Milky Way. For this particular subset we reveal the origin of the
dominant stellar halo component with high metallicity, [Fe/H]~-1, and high
orbital anisotropy, beta>0.8, by tracing their stars back to the epoch of
accretion. It appears that, typically, these stars come from a single dwarf
galaxy with a stellar mass of order of 10^9-10^10 Msol that merged around 6-10
Gyr ago, causing a sharp increase in the halo mass. Our study therefore
establishes a firm link between the excess of radially anisotropic stellar
debris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient head-on collision between the young
Milky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy

  design-based inference for forest inventory using systematic samples","  Systematic sampling is often used to select plot locations for forest
inventory estimation. However, it is not possible to derive a design-unbiased
variance estimator for a systematic sample using one random start. As a result,
many forest inventory analysts resort to applying variance estimators that are
design-unbiased following simple random sampling to their systematic samples
even though this typically leads to conservative estimates of error. We explore
the influence of spatial autocorrelation on variance estimation when systematic
sampling is employed using repeated sampling. We generate a sequence of 1000
synthetic populations with increasing spatial autocorrelation and repeatedly
sample from each to examine how the performance of estimators change as spatial
autocorrelation changes. We also repeatedly sample from a tree census plot in
Harvard Forest, Massachusetts and examine the performance of similar
estimators. Results indicate that applying variance estimators that are
unbiased following simple random sampling to systematic samples from
populations exhibiting stronger spatial autocorrelation tend to be more
conservative. We also find that incorporating ancillary wall-to-wall
covariates, e.g., remote sensing data, using generalized regression estimators
can reduce variance over-estimation by explaining some or all of the spatial
structure in the population.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09459v2,Fast radio burst source properties from polarization measurements,"  Recent polarization measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide new
insights on these enigmatic sources. We show that the nearly 100% linear
polarization and small variation of the polarization position angles (PAs) of
multiple bursts from the same source suggest that the radiation is produced
near the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star. As the emitted
radiation travels through the magnetosphere, the electric vector of the X-mode
wave adiabatically rotates and stays perpendicular to the local magnetic field
direction. The PA freezes at a radius where the plasma density becomes too
small to be able to turn the electric vector. At the freeze-out radius, the
electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron
star projected in the plane of the sky, independent of the radiation mechanism
or the orientation of the magnetic field in the emission region. We discuss a
number of predictions of the model. The variation of PAs from repeating FRBs
should follow the rotational period of the underlying neutron star (but the
burst occurrence may not be periodic). Measuring this period will provide
crucial support for the neutron star nature of the progenitors of FRBs. For FRB
121102, the small range of PA variation means that the magnetic inclination
angle is less than about 20 degrees and that the observer's line of sight is
outside the magnetic inclination cone. Other repeating FRBs may have a
different range of PA variation from that of FRB 121102, depending on the
magnetic inclination and the observer's viewing angle.

possible to use the existing X-ray archival data to improve source
localizations, identify optical counterparts, and classify the AGN with optical
spectroscopy. However, near the Galactic Plane, better X-ray positions are
necessary to achieve optical or near-IR identifications due to the higher
levels of source crowding. Thus, we have used observations with the Chandra

of the plane. One or two Chandra sources are detected within the error circle
of 15 of the serendips, and we report on these sources and search for optical
counterparts. For one source (NuSTAR J202421+3350.9), we obtained a new optical
spectrum and detected the presence of hydrogen emission lines. The source is
Galactic, and we argue that it is likely a Cataclysmic Variable. For the other

place limits on faint Galactic populations, including high-mass X-ray binaries

  and dust physics on outflow properties","  Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes, active galactic nuclei
(AGN), is now a cornerstone of galaxy formation models. In this work, we
present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative AGN feedback using the
novel Arepo-RT. A central black hole emits radiation at a constant luminosity
and drives an outflow via radiation pressure on dust grains. Utilising an
isolated NFW halo we validate our setup in the single and multi-scattering
regimes, with the simulated shock front propagation in excellent agreement with
the expected analytic result. For a spherically symmetric NFW halo, an
examination of the simulated outflow properties generated by radiative feedback
demonstrates that they are lower than typically observed at a fixed AGN
luminosity, regardless of the collimation of the radiation. We then explore the
impact of a central disc galaxy and the assumed dust model on the outflow
properties. The contraction of the halo during the galaxy's formation and
modelling the production of dust grains results in a factor $100$ increase in
the halo's optical depth. Radiation is then able to couple momentum more
efficiently to the gas, driving a stronger shock and producing a mass-loaded
$\sim10^{3}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ outflow with a velocity of
$\sim2000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations.
However, the inclusion of dust destruction mechanisms, like thermal sputtering,
leads to the rapid destruction of dust grains within the outflow, reducing its
properties below typically observed values. We conclude that radiative AGN
feedback can drive outflows, but a thorough numerical and physical treatment is
required to assess its true impact.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08705v1,Ambitious Data Science Can Be Painless,"  Modern data science research can involve massive computational
experimentation; an ambitious PhD in computational fields may do experiments
consuming several million CPU hours. Traditional computing practices, in which
researchers use laptops or shared campus-resident resources, are inadequate for
experiments at the massive scale and varied scope that we now see in data
science. On the other hand, modern cloud computing promises seemingly unlimited
computational resources that can be custom configured, and seems to offer a
powerful new venue for ambitious data-driven science. Exploiting the cloud
fully, the amount of work that could be completed in a fixed amount of time can
expand by several orders of magnitude.
  As potentially powerful as cloud-based experimentation may be in the
abstract, it has not yet become a standard option for researchers in many
academic disciplines. The prospect of actually conducting massive computational
experiments in today's cloud systems confronts the potential user with daunting
challenges. Leading considerations include: (i) the seeming complexity of
today's cloud computing interface, (ii) the difficulty of executing an
overwhelmingly large number of jobs, and (iii) the difficulty of monitoring and
combining a massive collection of separate results. Starting a massive
experiment `bare-handed' seems therefore highly problematic and prone to rapid
`researcher burn out'.
  New software stacks are emerging that render massive cloud experiments
relatively painless. Such stacks simplify experimentation by systematizing
experiment definition, automating distribution and management of tasks, and
allowing easy harvesting of results and documentation. In this article, we
discuss several painless computing stacks that abstract away the difficulties

http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03145v2,Observations of red giants with suspected massive companions,"  Motivated by the existence of binary systems where a stellar-mass black hole
is bound to a normal star, we selected four red giants with large radial
velocity (RV) variation from the survey of SIM grid stars and monitored their
RVs for several months. None turned out to contain a massive companion above
2.5 solar masses. The red giant TYC 9299-1080-1 with a large RV and a large
proper motion is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 81 days.
It is an extreme halo object moving at 350 km s$^{-1}$ almost directly toward
the Galactic center. HD 206092 is a double-lined binary with a short period of
4.37 days. It belongs to the rare class of active RS CVn-type binaries with
evolved primary components, apparently undergoing mass transfer. The X-ray
luminosity of HD 206092 is about twice as high as the most luminous coronal
X-ray emitters observed by ROSAT, including II Peg and the prototype star RS
CVn. HD~318347 has a variable double-peaked emission-line spectrum (not a
giant), while HD~324668 has a constant RV. Despite the overall good quality of
the SIM survey data confirmed by a comparison with Gaia DR2 mean radial
velocities, the few large RV variations are explained, mostly, by erroneous
data. We discuss the significance of the non-detection of massive companions in
the SIM grid sample and the associated work.

coverage back to 2005, but we extend the observational baseline for AR Sco back
to the beginning of the 20th century by analyzing observations from the Digital
Access to a Sky Century at Harvard project (DASCH). We find that the orbital
waveform of AR Sco remained constant across that baseline with no significant
deviations from its average brightness. This result strongly suggests that the
absence of accretion in modern observations is a long-term feature of AR Sco.
Additionally, the DASCH light curve provides an opportunity to test an earlier
prediction that an obliquity of the WD would result in a precessional period
observable in long-term studies of the orbital light curve. The DASCH
observations do not indicate the presence of such a period, and we show that
previous, inconclusive tests of this hypothesis were insensitive to the
existence of a precessional period. Furthermore, the long DASCH baseline
enables us to constrain the rate of change of the orbital frequency to
$\dot{\nu} \lesssim 3.8\times10^{-20}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, constraining the efficacy
of magnetic braking as a mechanism of angular-momentum loss in this system.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11607v3,Deep Learning with Gaussian Differential Privacy,"  Deep learning models are often trained on datasets that contain sensitive
information such as individuals' shopping transactions, personal contacts, and
medical records. An increasingly important line of work therefore has sought to
train neural networks subject to privacy constraints that are specified by
differential privacy or its divergence-based relaxations. These privacy
definitions, however, have weaknesses in handling certain important primitives
(composition and subsampling), thereby giving loose or complicated privacy
analyses of training neural networks. In this paper, we consider a recently
proposed privacy definition termed \textit{$f$-differential privacy} [18] for a
refined privacy analysis of training neural networks. Leveraging the appealing
properties of $f$-differential privacy in handling composition and subsampling,
this paper derives analytically tractable expressions for the privacy
guarantees of both stochastic gradient descent and Adam used in training deep
neural networks, without the need of developing sophisticated techniques as [3]
did. Our results demonstrate that the $f$-differential privacy framework allows
for a new privacy analysis that improves on the prior analysis~[3], which in
turn suggests tuning certain parameters of neural networks for a better
prediction accuracy without violating the privacy budget. These theoretically
derived improvements are confirmed by our experiments in a range of tasks in
image classification, text classification, and recommender systems. Python code

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02825v1,Simulating dust grain-radiation coupling on a moving mesh,"  We present a model for the interaction between dust and radiation fields in
the radiation hydrodynamic code AREPO-RT, which solves the moment-based
radiative transfer equations on an unstructured moving mesh. Dust is directly
treated using live simulation particles, each of which represent a population
of grains that are coupled to hydrodynamic motion through a drag force. We
introduce methods to calculate radiation pressure on and photon absorption by
dust grains. By including a direct treatment of dust, we are able to calculate
dust opacities and update radiation fields self-consistently based on the local
dust distribution. This hybrid scheme coupling dust particles to an
unstructured mesh for radiation is validated using several test problems with
known analytic solutions, including dust driven via spherically-symmetric flux
from a constant luminosity source and photon absorption from radiation incident
on a thin layer of dust. Our methods are compatible with the multifrequency
scheme in AREPO-RT, which treats UV and optical photons as single-scattered and
IR photons as multi-scattered. At IR wavelengths, we model heating of and
thermal emission from dust. Dust and gas are not assumed to be in local
thermodynamic equilibrium but transfer energy through collisional exchange. We
estimate dust temperatures by balancing these dust-radiation and dust-gas
energy exchange rates. This framework for coupling dust and radiation can be
applied in future radiation hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation.

explore changes in the average global surface temperature of an Earth-like
planet due to variations in the surface oceans and emerged land coverage, rate
of volcanism (degassing), and the level of the received solar radiation. The
temperature is calculated using a simple carbon-silicate cycle model to change
the level of $\rm CO_2$ in the atmosphere based on the chosen parameters. The

by varying all three parameters, including freeze-thaw cycles for a planet with
our present-day volcanism rate and emerged land fraction situated at the outer
edge of the habitable zone. To increase engagement, the planet is visualised by
using a neural network to render an animated globe, based on the calculated
average surface temperature and chosen values for land fraction and volcanism.
The website and bot can be found at earthlike.world and on twitter as

  in galaxies","  We combine the latest observationally motivated constraints on stellar
properties in dark matter haloes, along with data-driven predictions for the
atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) gas evolution in galaxies, to derive
empirical relationships between the build-up of galactic components and their
evolution over cosmic time. At high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), the frameworks
imply that galaxies acquire their cold gas (both atomic and molecular) mostly
by accretion, with the fraction of cold gas reaching about 20% of the cosmic
baryon fraction. We infer a strong dependence of the star formation rate on the
H$_2$ mass, suggesting a near-universal depletion timescale of 0.1-1 Gyr in
Milky Way sized haloes (of masses $10^{12} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$). There is
also evidence for a near-universality of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation across
redshifts, with very little dependence on stellar mass, if a constant
conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) of CO luminosity to molecular gas mass is
assumed. Combining the atomic and molecular gas observations with the stellar
build-up illustrates that galactic mass assembly in Milky-Way sized haloes
proceeds from smooth accretion at high redshifts, towards becoming
merger-dominated at late times ($z \lesssim 0.6$). Our results can be used to
constrain numerical simulations of the dominant growth and accretion processes
of galaxies over cosmic history.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01933v1,Dust entrainment in galactic winds,"  Winds driven by stellar feedback are an essential part of the galactic
ecosystem and are the main mechanism through which low-mass galaxies regulate
their star formation. These winds are generally observed to be multi-phase with
detections of entrained neutral and molecular gas. They are also thought to
enrich the circum-galactic medium around galaxies with metals and dust. This
ejected dust encodes information about the integrated star formation and
outflow history of the galaxy. It is therefore, important to understand how
much dust is entrained and driven out of the disc by galactic winds. Here we
demonstrate that stellar feedback is efficient in driving dust-enriched winds
and eject enough material to account for the amount of extraplanar dust
observed in nearby galaxies. The amount of dust in the wind depends on the
sites from where they are launched, with dustier galaxies launching more dust
enriched outflows. Moreover, the outflowing cold-dense gas is significantly
more dust-enriched than the volume filling hot tenuous material, naturally
reproducing the complex multiphase structure of the outflowing wind observed in
nearby galaxies. These results provide an important new insight into the
dynamics, structure, and composition of galactic winds and their role in
determining the dust content of the extragalactic gas in galaxies.

  Emission","  Recent observations of nearby Compton thick (CT) active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) with Chandra have resolved hard (>3 keV) X-ray emission extending out
from the central supermassive black hole to kiloparsec scales, challenging the
long-held belief that the characteristic hard X-ray continuum and fluorescent
Fe K lines originate in the inner ~parsec due to the excitation of obscuring
material. In this paper we present the results of the most recent Chandra
ACIS-S observations of NGC 7212, a CT AGN in a compact group of interacting
galaxies, with a total effective exposure of ~150 ks. We find ~20 percent of
the observed emission is found outside of the central ~kiloparsec, with ~17
percent associated with the soft X-rays, and ~3 percent with hard X-ray
continuum and Fe K line. This emission is extended both along the ionization
cone and in the cross-cone direction up to ~3.8 kpc scales. The spectrum of NGC
7212 is best represented by a mixture of thermal and photoionization models
that indicate the presence of complex gas interactions. These observations are
consistent with what is observed in other CT AGN (e.g., ESO 428-G014, NGC

High-resolution observations of extended CT AGN provide an especially valuable

measures of relative risk that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical
resource allocation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the middle of an

We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that

freedom which decoupled from the SM while relativistic. Nearly massless relics
contribute to the radiation energy budget, and are commonly searched through
variations in the effective number $N_{\rm eff}$ of neutrino species.
Additionally, relics with masses on the eV scale (meV-10 eV) become
non-relativistic before today, and thus behave as matter instead of radiation.
This leaves an imprint in the clustering of the large-scale structure of the
universe, as light relics have important streaming motions, mirroring the case
of massive neutrinos. Here we forecast how well current and upcoming
cosmological surveys can probe light massive relics (LiMRs). We consider
minimal extensions to the SM by both fermionic and bosonic relic degrees of
freedom. By combining current and upcoming cosmic-microwave-background and
large-scale-structure surveys, we forecast the significance at which each LiMR,
with different masses and temperatures, can be detected. We find that a very

neutrinos consists of leveraging cosmological datasets, such as the cosmic
microwave background and surveys of the large-scale structure of the universe.
In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the neutrino mass, however, many
effects ought to be included. Here we forecast, via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
likelihood analysis, whether measurements by two galaxy surveys: DESI and {\it
Euclid}, when added to the CMB-S4 experiment, are sensitive to two effects that
can alter neutrino-mass measurements. The first is the slight difference in the
suppression of matter fluctuations that each neutrino-mass hierarchy generates,
at fixed total mass. The second is the growth-induced scale-dependent bias
(GISDB) of haloes produced by massive neutrinos. We find that near-future
surveys can distinguish hierarchies with the same total mass only at the
$1\sigma$ level; thus, while these are poised to deliver a measurement of the
sum of neutrino masses, they cannot significantly discern the mass of each
individual neutrino in the foreseeable future. We further find that neglecting
the GISDB induces up to a $1\sigma$ overestimation of the total neutrino mass,
and we show how to absorb this effect via a redshift-dependent parametrization

constrain the passband-specific dust reddening vector in the Milky Way. The
model uses a neural network to learn the (de-reddened) absolute magnitude in
one band and colors across many bands, given stellar parameters from
spectroscopic surveys and parallax constraints from Gaia. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach, we train our model on a dataset with
spectroscopic labels from LAMOST, APOGEE and GALAH, Gaia parallaxes, and
optical and near-infrared photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS 1, 2MASS and WISE.
Testing the model on these datasets leads to an excellent fit and a precise --
and by construction accurate -- prediction of the color-magnitude diagrams in
many bands. This flexible approach rigorously links spectroscopic and
photometric surveys, and also results in an improved, temperature-dependent
reddening vector. As such, it provides a simple and accurate method for
predicting photometry in stellar evolutionary models. Our model will form a
basis to infer stellar properties, distances and dust extinction from
photometric data, which should be of great use in 3D mapping of the Milky Way.

(supervised learning) and OpenAI's attention-based GPT-2 models, synthetic
MFCCs are generated by learning from the data provided on a per-subject basis.
A neural network is trained to classify the data against a large dataset of
Flickr8k speakers and is then compared to a transfer learning network
performing the same task but with an initial weight distribution dictated by
learning from the synthetic data generated by the two models. The best result
for all of the 7 subjects were networks that had been exposed to synthetic
data, the model pre-trained with LSTM-produced data achieved the best result 3
times and the GPT-2 equivalent 5 times (since one subject had their best result
from both models at a draw). Through these results, we argue that speaker
classification can be improved by utilising a small amount of user data but

  II. Quantum dot and Floquet theory","  In this paper, we provide Keldysh microscopic calculations and physical
pictures for the voltage-$V$ dependence of the quartet current in a
four-terminal quantum dot Josephson junction containing a loop pierced by
reduced flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$. Landau-Zener tunneling at avoided crossings in the
Floquet spectrum produces hybridization between the two Floquet states. An
inversion $I_{q,c}(V,0)<I_{q,c}(V,1/2)$ in the critical current
$I_{q,c}(V,\Phi/\Phi_0)$ on the quartet line is obtained at sufficiently large
$V$ if an avoided crossing appears at $(V,\Phi/\Phi_0=0)$ but not at $(V,1/2)$.
The inversion originates from the reduction in $I_{q,c}$ produced by the
dynamical quantum mechanical superposition of the two Andreev bound state
manifolds. In addition, $\pi$-$0$ and $0$-$\pi$ cross-overs emerge in the
current-phase relations as $V$ is further increased. This $\pi$-shift is an
effect of the nonequilibrium Floquet populations produced by voltage biasing.
Numerical calculations show that the inversions are robust against strong
Landau-Zener tunneling and many levels in the quantum dot. Our theory supports
that the recent Harvard group experimental observation of an inversion at
finite $V$ is a signature of quantum fluctuations in the dc-quartet current.

broad range of biomedical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic challenges. This
wide-reaching scientific capacity, however, also raises a diverse array of
ethical challenges. The need for researchers to act quickly and globally in
tackling SARS-CoV-2 demands unprecedented practices of open research and
responsible data sharing at a time when innovation ecosystems are hobbled by
proprietary protectionism, inequality, and a lack of public trust. Moreover,
societally impactful interventions like digital contact tracing are raising
fears of surveillance creep and are challenging widely held commitments to
privacy, autonomy, and civil liberties. Prepandemic concerns that data-driven
innovations may function to reinforce entrenched dynamics of societal inequity
have likewise intensified given the disparate impact of the virus on vulnerable
social groups and the life-and-death consequences of biased and discriminatory
public health outcomes. To address these concerns, I offer five steps that need
to be taken to encourage responsible research and innovation. These provide a
practice-based path to responsible AI/ML design and discovery centered on open,
accountable, equitable, and democratically governed processes and products.
When taken from the start, these steps will not only enhance the capacity of
innovators to tackle COVID-19 responsibly, they will, more broadly, help to

constraints on the accretion processes that power active galactic nuclei (AGN),
fuel outflows, and trigger black hole growth. However, spin measurements are
mainly limited to a few dozen nearby sources for which high quality, high S/N
spectra (e.g., from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, NuSTAR) are available. Here we
measure the average SMBH spin of $\sim$1900 AGN in the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy
survey using spectral stacking analysis. We find broad Fe K$\alpha$ line
emission in the average COSMOS spectrum (Gaussian width $\sigma=0.27\pm0.05$
keV), and by fitting this emission line profile with relativistic line models,
we measure the average black hole spin parameter $a=0.62~\substack{+0.07 \\
-0.17}$. The sample size, availability of multiwavelength data, and spatial
resolution of the COSMOS Legacy field also provide a unique environment to
investigate the average SMBH spin as a function of other observables (e.g.,
redshift, luminosity) up to $z\sim5.3$. We find that optically classified Type
1 sources have broader Fe K$\alpha$ line emission than Type 2 sources. X-ray
unobscured and obscured sources, as defined by their column densities, have
widths that are consistent with the optically defined unobscured and obscured
sources, respectively. There is some evidence for evolution of the Fe K$\alpha$

redshift. The results of this work provide insights into the average spins of
SMBHs in AGN, shedding light on their growth mechanisms and observed

always been challenging to measure because of the significant rotational
broadening of the spectral lines. The large scatter in published velocities has
led to claims that many are spectroscopic binaries, and in several cases
preliminary orbital solutions have been proposed. To investigate these claims,
we obtained and report here velocity measurements for 33 rapidly-rotating B, A,

precision of the historical velocities for most objects. With one or two

also rule out all four of the previously published orbital solutions, for HD

but with a different period (71.8 days). HD 23338 is likely a binary as well,
with a preliminary 8.7 yr period also different from the one published.
Additionally, we report a 3635 day orbit for HD 24899, another new
spectroscopic binary in the cluster. From the 32 bona fide members in our
sample we determine a mean radial velocity for the Pleiades of 5.79 +/- 0.24

excluded. Adding these astrometric binaries to the new spectroscopic ones, we
find a lower limit to the binary fraction among the B and A stars of 37%. In
addition to the velocities, we measure v sin i for all stars, ranging between

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06864v1,Reproducibility and Replication of Experimental Particle Physics Results,"  The recent ""replication crisis"" has caused practitioners and journal editors
in many fields in science to examine closely their methodologies and publishing
criteria. Experimental particle physicists are no exceptions to this, but some
of the unique features of this sub-field of physics make the issues of
reproduction and replication of results a very interesting and informative
topic. The experiments take many years to design, construct, and operate.
Because the equipment is so large and complex, like that of the Large Hadron
Collider and its associated particle detectors, the costs are very high. Large
collaborations produce and check the results, and many papers are signed by
more than three thousand authors. Experimental particle physics is a mature
field with strong traditions followed by the collaborations. This paper gives
an introduction to what experimental particle physics is and to some of the
tools that are used to analyze the data. It describes the procedures used to
ensure that results can be computationally reproduced, both internally and
externally. It also describes methods particle physicists use to maximize the
reliability of the results, which increases the probability that they can be
replicated by other collaborations or even the same collaborations with more
data and new personnel. Examples of results that were later found to be false
are given, both with failed replication attempts and some with alarmingly
successful replications. While some of the characteristics of particle physics
experiments are unique, many of the procedures and techniques can be and are
used in other fields.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10982v1,An Introduction to Proximal Causal Learning,"  A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that
one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within
covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values.
Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is
often warranted because it hinges on investigators' ability to accurately
measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding.
Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with
certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that
covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding
mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims
made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions. Causal learning from
proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal
causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as
imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn
about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured
covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are
given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal
g-computation algorithm for estimation. These may be viewed as generalizations
of Robins' foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account
explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and
time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal
g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11902v1,Increasing activity in T CrB suggests nova eruption is impending,"  Estimates of the accretion rate in symbiotic recurrent novae (RNe) often fall
short of theoretical expectations by orders of magnitude. This apparent
discrepancy can be resolved if the accumulation of mass by the white dwarf (WD)
is highly sporadic, and most observations are performed during low states. Here
we use a reanalysis of archival data from the Digital Access to a Sky Century
@Harvard (DASCH) survey to argue that the most recent nova eruption in
symbiotic RN T CrB, in 1946, occurred during -- and was therefore triggered by
-- a transient accretion high state. Based on similarities in the optical light
curve around 1946 and the time of the prior eruption, in 1866, we suggest that
the WD in T CrB accumulates most of the fuel needed to ignite the thermonuclear
runaways (TNRs) during accretion high states. A natural origin for such states
is dwarf-nova like accretion-disk instabilities, which are expected in the
presumably large disks in symbiotic binaries. The timing of the TNRs in
symbiotic RNe could thus be set by the stability properties of their accretion
disks. T CrB is in the midst of an accretion high state like the ones we posit
led to the past two nova eruptions. Combined with the approach of the time at
which a TNR would be expected based on the 80-year interval between the prior
two novae ($2026 \pm$3), the current accretion high state increases the
likelihood of a TNR occurring in T CrB in the next few years.

  Constant","  We present a simple mass model for the lensing galaxy in the gravitationally
lensed quasar 0957+561. The model is a generalization of the singular
isothermal sphere and includes a core radius, $r_c$, and a power-law index,
$\eta$, defined such that mass increases as $r^\eta$ at large radius. We
approximate the galaxy cluster surrounding the lensing galaxy with a quadratic
potential described by its convergence $\kappa$ and shear $\gamma$. We fit the
model to a recent high resolution VLBI map of the two images of 0957+561. We
obtain a tight constraint on the radial index, $1.07 < \eta <1.18$, which means
that the lens galaxy is nearly isothermal with increasing mass-to-light ratio
out to $15 h^{-1}$ kpc. We also obtain an upper limit on the core radius, $r_c
< 330 h^{-1}$ pc. We use the model to calculate the Hubble constant $H_0$ as a
function of the time delay $\Delta\tau_{BA}$ between the two images: $H_0 =
\left({ 82.5^{+5.9} _{-3.0} }\right) (1 - \kappa) \left({ \Delta\tau_{BA}/1.1
\,{\rm yr} }\right)^{-1}$ km/s/Mpc. Once $\Delta \tau_{BA}$ is measured, this
will provide an upper bound on $H_0$ since $\kappa$ cannot be negative. In
addition, the model degeneracy due to $\kappa$ can be eliminated if the
one-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the lensing galaxy is measured.
We then have $H_0 = \left({ 82.5^{+8.7} _{-5.6} }\right) (\sigma / 322\,{\rm
km/s})^2 \left({ \Delta \tau_{BA} /1.1 \,{\rm yr} }\right)^{-1}$ km/s/Mpc. We
investigate the effects of ellipticity in the lensing galaxy and clumpiness in

with average redshift $z = 0.1$, from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. The
luminosity function may be fit by a Schechter function with $M^* = -20.29 \pm
0.02 + 5 \log h$, $\alpha = -0.70 \pm 0.05$, and $\phi^* = 0.019 \pm 0.001 \
h^3$~Mpc$^{-3}$, for absolute magnitudes $-23.0 \leq M - 5 \log h \leq -17.5$.
We compare our luminosity function to that from other redshift surveys; in
particular our normalization is consistent with that of the Stromlo-APM survey,
and is therefore a factor of two below that implied by the $b_J \approx 20$
bright galaxy counts. Our normalization thus indicates that much more evolution
is needed to match the faint galaxy count data, compared to minimal evolution
models which normalize at $b_J \approx 20$. Also, we show that our faint-end
slope $\alpha = -0.7$, though ``shallower'' than typical previous values
$\alpha = -1$, results primarily from fitting the detailed shape of the LCRS
luminosity function, rather than from any absence of intrinsically faint
galaxies from our survey. Finally, using [OII] 3727 equivalent width
$W_{\lambda} = 5$~\AA \ as the dividing line, we find significant differences
in the luminosity functions of emission and non-emission galaxies, particularly
in their $\alpha$ values. Emission galaxies have Schechter parameters $M^* =
-20.03 \pm 0.03 + 5 \log h$ and $\alpha = -0.9 \pm 0.1$, while non-emission
galaxies are described by $M^* = -20.22 \pm 0.02 + 5 \log h$ and $\alpha = -0.3

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9603033v1,A Line of Sight Approach to Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies,"  We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon
past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a
time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The
geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the
particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of
photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a
small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between
the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More
importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared
to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on
the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a
slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small
number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than
the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed
in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a
much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of
magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically
requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should
be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters
from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible
with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method
can be obtained from the authors.

functions, and mass-to-light ratios in A2626 and A2440. The symmetric X-ray
emission from A2626 suggests a relaxed, single-component system; however, 159
redshifts reveals a complex, three component cluster at cz~17,500km/s. One
components is a typical X-ray bright cluster, a second has a cluster-like
galaxy population with lower central galaxy and gas density, and the third is a
background structure with field galaxy composition. A comparison of the
magnitude distributions within the two subclusters suggests that A2626 is a
merger in progress. Virial masses and a composite luminosity function for a
region with projected radius r=1.5h^{-1}Mpc yield a mass to light ratio
M/L_R~610h. Analysis of the X-ray emission from the primary component yields a
gas mass fraction of 2.2h^{-3/2}% and a baryon fraction of 3.4%. A radial
infall model implies that the virial mass may be an underestimate. In A2440,
deep CCD $R$ band photometry indicates a striking correspondence between the
galaxy and gas distributions. The galaxy distribution has three main
components, each associated with a giant elliptical galaxy. The two larger
peaks in the galaxy distribution coincide with the primary peaks in the X-ray
emission, and the third is associated with a significant X-ray surface
brightness enhancement. We use this galaxy-gas correspondence and 48 redshifts

two primary components are beginning to merge. The composite luminosity
function and estimates of the subcluster virial masses indicate a mass-to-light

mass X-ray binary 4U 0614+091 in observations with XTE. The observations span
several months and sample the source over a large range of X-ray luminosity. In
every interval QPOs are present above 400 Hz with fractional RMS amplitudes
from 3 to 12%. At high count rates, two high frequency QPOs are detected
simultaneously. The difference of their frequency centroids is consistent with
323 Hz in all observations. During one interval a third signal is detected at
328 +/- 2 Hz. This suggests the system has a stable `clock' which is most
likely the neutron star with spin period 3.1 msec. Thus, our observations and
those of another neutron star system by Strohmayer et al. (1996) provide the
first evidence for millisecond pulsars within low-mass X-ray binary systems and
reveal the `missing-link' between millisecond radiopulsars and the late stages
of binary evolution in low mass X-ray binaries (Alpar et al. 1982). We suggest
that the kinematics of the magnetospheric beat-frequency model (Alpar and
Shaham 1985) applies to these QPOs. In this interpretation the high frequency
signal is associated with the Keplerian frequency of the inner accretion disk
and the lower frequency `beat' signal arises from the differential rotation
frequency of the inner disk and the spinning neutron star. Assuming the high
frequency QPO is a Keplerian orbital frequency for the accretion disk, we find
a maximum mass of 1.9 solar masses and a maximum radius of 17 km for the

its clumpy state today occurred during the epoch when the first stars and
low-luminosity quasars formed. For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, the radiation
produced by the first baryonic objects is expected to ionize the Universe at
z=10-20 and consequently suppress by 10% the amplitude of microwave
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees. Future microwave anisotropy
satellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of
metals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the

Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to image directly the
``first light'' from these stars. With its nJy sensitivity, NGST is expected to
detect >10^3 star clusters per square arcminute at z>10. The brightest sources,
however, might be early quasars. The infrared flux from an Eddington
luminosity, 10^6 solar mass, black hole at z=10 is 10 nJy at 1 micron, easily
detectable with NGST. The time it takes a black hole with a radiative
efficiency of 10% to double its mass amounts to more than a tenth of the Hubble
time at z=10, and so a fair fraction of all systems which harbor a central
black hole at this redshift would appear active. The redshift of all sources
can be determined from the Lyman-limit break in their spectrum, which overlaps
with the NGST wavelength regime, 1-3.5 micron, for 10<z<35. Absorption spectra
of the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the
reionization history of the Universe. The intergalactic medium might show a
significant opacity to infrared sources at z>10 due to dust produced by the
first supernovae.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9804287v1,Stellar Activity in Coeval Open Clusters: Praesepe and The Hyades,"  Randich and Schmitt [1995, A&A 298, 115] found that the coronal activity of
solar-type and low mass stars in Praesepe is significantly lower than that of
stars in the Hyades cluster. We have carried out several tests in order to find
a possible explanation for this result. We have measured radial velocities of
two groups of Praesepe stars (a dF-dK sample and a dM sample) and have measured
H$\alpha$ as a chromospheric activity index for the dM sample. We conclude that
the Praesepe catalog used in the X-ray analysis does not contain a significant
number of non-members. The comparison of the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths for
the M dwarfs in Praesepe with those in the Hyades indicates that, at least for
stars in this mass range, the Praesepe stars are as active or more active than
their Hyades counterparts. We have also analyzed a few ROSAT PSPC pointings of
Praesepe in order to obtain a new and independent estimate of the X-ray
luminosities and upper limits for a small sample of Praesepe members concluding
that the small differences between the old and new upper limits are not large
enough to explain the dichotomy in the X-ray properties of Praesepe and the
Hyades. Therefore, our examination of the available data does not provide a
clear reason to explain why the X-ray luminosity functions of the two clusters
are different. Part of the explanation could be found in the binaries.
Speculatively, these clusters could have different orbital period
distributions, with more short period binaries among the Hyades, which would
show larger coronal activity.

variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al.
(1998) to present evidence that CVs 1--4 all have faint disks and probably low
accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the
published spectra of Grindlay et al. (1995) we present new evidence that CVs
1--3 may be DQ Her systems, and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or
another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae
in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a
member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do
not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as ``non-flickerers'' (NFs).
Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the
cluster center. Using stellar atmosphere models we have determined log g =
6.25, and T_eff = 17,500 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the
luminosity of the NF we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium
WD having a mass of ~0.25 solar masses and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr
(depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly
Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a
dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen WD.

nebula candidates using two mid-IR cameras (MIRAC2 and Berkcam) at the NASA
Infrared Telescope Facility and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. The goal
of this survey is to determine the size, flux, and morphology of the mid-IR
emission regions, which sample the inner regions of the circumstellar dust
shells of proto-planetary nebulae. We imaged these proto-planetary nebulae with
narrow-band filters ($\Delta\lambda / \lambda \sim 10%$) at wavelengths of
notable dust features. With our typical angular resolution of 1\arcsec, we
resolve 17 sources, find 48 objects unresolved, and do not detect 1 source. For
several sources, we checked optical and infrared associations and positions of
the sources. In table format, we list the size and flux measurements for all
the detected objects and show figures of all the resolved sources. Images for
all the detected objects are available on line in FITS format from the
Astronomy Digital Image Library at the National Center for Supercomputing
Application. The proto-planetary nebula candidate sample includes, in addition
to the predominant proto-planetary nebulae, extreme asymptotic giant branch
stars, young planetary nebulae, a supergiant, and a luminous blue variable. We
find that dust shells which are cooler ($\rm T \sim 150$ K) and brighter in the
infrared are more easily resolved. Eleven of the seventeen resolved sources are
extended and fall into one of two types of mid-IR morphological classes:
core/elliptical or toroidal. Core/elliptical structures show unresolved cores
with lower surface brightness elliptical nebulae. Toroidal structures show
limb-brightened peaks suggesting equatorial density enhancements. We argue that
core/ellipticals have denser dust shells than toroidals.

redshift catalog designed to resemble the upcoming Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). The catalog, drawn from a large N-body simulation of a Lambda-CDM cos-
mological model, mimics the anticipated spectroscopic selection procedures of
the SDSS in some detail. Sky maps, redshift slices, and 3-D contour maps of the
mock survey reveal a rich and complex structure, including networks of voids
and superclusters that resemble the patterns seen in the CfA redshift survey
and the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). The 3-D genus curve can be
measured from the simulated catalog with superb precision; this curve has the
general shape predicted for Gaussian, random phase initial conditions, but the
error bars are small enough to demonstrate with high significance the subtle
departures from this shape caused by non-linear gravitational evolution. These
distortions have the form predicted by Matsubara's (1994) perturbative anal-
ysis, but they are much smaller in amplitude. We also measure the 3-D genus
curve of the radial peculiar velocity field measured by applying distance-
indicator relations (with realistic errors) to the mock catalog. This genus
curve is consistent with the Gaussian random phase prediction, though it is of
relatively low precision because of the large smoothing length required to
overcome noise in the measured velocity field. Finally, we measure the 2-D
topology in redshift slices, similar to early slices from the SDSS and to
slices already observed in the LCRS. The genus curves of these slices are
consistent with the observed genus curves of the LCRS, providing further
evidence in favor of the inflationary CDM model with Omega_M~0.4. The catalog

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905052v2,Hard X-ray emission from elliptical galaxies,"  We report the detection of hard X-ray emission components in the spectra of
six nearby, giant elliptical galaxies observed with the ASCA satellite. The
systems studied, which exhibit strong dynamical evidence for supermassive black
holes in their nuclei, are M87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696 (the dominant galaxies of
the Virgo, Fornax and Centaurus clusters, respectively) and NGC 4472, 4636 and
4649 (three further giant ellipticals in the Virgo cluster). The ASCA data for
all six sources provide clear evidence for hard emission components, which can
be parameterized by power-law models with photon indices in the range \Gamma =
0.6-1.5 (mean value 1.2) and intrinsic 1-10 keV luminosities of 2 \times
10^{40} - 2 \times 10^{42} erg/s. Our results imply the identification of a new
class of accreting X-ray source, with X-ray spectra significantly harder than
those of binary X-ray sources, Seyfert nuclei or low luminosity AGN, and
bolometric luminosities relatively dominated by their X-ray emission. We
discuss various possible origins for the hard X-ray emission and argue that it
is most likely to be due to accretion onto the central supermassive black
holes, via low-radiative efficiency accretion coupled with strong outflows. In
the case of M87, our detected power-law flux is in good agreement with a
previously-reported measurement from ROSAT High Resolution Imager observations,
which were able to resolve the jet from the nuclear X-ray emission components.
We confirm previous results showing that the use of multiphase models in the
analysis of the ASCA data leads to determinations of approximately solar
emission-weighted metallicities for the X-ray gas in the galaxies. We also
present results on the individual element abundances in NGC 4636.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905053v1,Low radiative efficiency accretion in the nuclei of elliptical galaxies,"  The discovery of hard, power-law X-ray emission from a sample of six nearby
elliptical galaxies, including the dominant galaxies of the Virgo,Fornax and
Centaurus clusters (M87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696, respectively), and NGC 4472,
4636 and 4649 in the Virgo cluster, has important implications for the study of
quiescent supermassive black holes. We describe how the broad band spectral
energy distributions of these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous
halos at rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by
low-radiative efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of the
mass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. The
observed suppression of the synchrotron component in the radio band and the
systematically hard X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal
bremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflow
is a natural consequence of systems accreting at low-radiative efficiencies. We
briefly discuss an alternative model for the X-ray emission, namely that it is
due to nonthermal synchrotron-self Compton processes in the accretion flow, or
wind. This appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. Emission from a
collimated jet viewed off axis should be distinguishable from the
bremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We argue
that the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral and
elliptical galaxies arises from the different manner in which interstellar gas
is fed into the nuclei. In ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowly
cooling) ISM is likely to be highly magnetized and with low specific angular
momentum, both of which favor low-radiative efficiency accretion solutions and
possibly the formation of the observed jets.

  The purpose of the present work is to test if idealized turbulent flows,
without self-gravity, stellar radiation, stellar outflows, or any other effect
of star formation, are inconsistent or not with statistical properties of star
forming molecular clouds.
  We present several statistical results that demonstrate remarkable similarity
between real data and the synthetic cloud. Statistical properties of molecular
clouds like Perseus are appropriately described by random super-sonic and
super-Alfvenic MHD flows. Although the description of gravity and stellar
radiation are essential to understand the formation of single protostars and
the effects of star formation in the cloud dynamics, the overall description of
the cloud and of the initial conditions for star formation can apparently be
provided on intermediate scales without accounting for gravity, stellar
radiation, and a detailed modeling of stellar outflows.
  We also show that the relation between equivalent line width and integrated

sources have very similar power spectra, displaying high frequency noise up to
\~200 Hz. For KS1731-260, its power spectrum is dominated by noise at
frequencies below 20 Hz. In addition a quasi-periodic oscillation at 1200 Hz is
detected. The 1-200 keV LS spectra are all consistent with resulting from
thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature (kTe) around 25-30 keV. For
KS1731-260, the spectrum is also dominated by Comptonization, but with kTe
around 3 keV and no significant hard X-ray emission. With the exception of
GS1826-238, there is an underlying soft component. For all sources, we have

of main energy release, where hard X-rays are produced would be an optically
thin boundary layer merged with an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF).
The soft component observed probably represents the unscattered emission from
the accretion disk of variable inner radius. When the accretion rate increases,
the inner disk radius shrinks, the strength of the reflected component and
associated iron line increase, and the Comptonization region cools off in
response to an increased cooling flux from the accretion disk and from the

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001314v2,"Theory of ""Jitter"" Radiation from Small-Scale Random Magnetic Fields and
  Prompt Emission from Gamma-Ray Burst Shocks","  Abridged.-- We demonstrate that the radiation emitted by ultrarelativistic
electrons in highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields is different from
synchrotron radiation if the electron's transverse deflections in these fields
are much smaller than the beaming angle. A quantitative analytical theory of
this radiation, which we refer to as jitter radiation, is developed. It is
shown that the emergent spectrum is determined by statistical properties of the
magnetic field. As an example,we then use the model of a magnetic field in
internal shocks of GRBs. The spectral power distribution of radiation produced
by the power-law electrons is well described by a sharply broken power-law with
indices 1 and -(p-1)/2 and the jitter break frequency is independent of the
field strength but depends on the electron density in the ejecta. Since
large-scale fields may also be present in the ejecta, we construct a
two-component, jitter+synchrotron spectral model of the prompt $\gamma$-ray
emission. Quite surprisingly, this model seems to be readily capable of
explaining several properties of time-resolved spectra of some GRBs, such as
(i) the violation of the constraint on the low-energy spectral index called the
synchrotron ``line of death'', (ii) the sharp spectral break at the peak
frequency, inconsistent with the broad synchrotron bump, (iii) the evidence for
two spectral sub-components, and (iv) possible existence of emission features
called ``GRB lines''. We believe these facts strongly support both the
existence of small-scale magnetic fields and the proposed radiation mechanism
from GRB shocks. As an example, we use the composite model to analyze GRB
910503 which has two spectral peaks.

  J1550-564","  We report on the X-ray spectral behavior of the exceptionally bright X-ray
nova XTE J1550-564 during its 1998-99 outburst. Our study is based on 209
pointed observations using the PCA and HEXTE instruments onboard the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer spanning 250 days and covering the entire double-peaked
eruption that occurred from 1998 September until 1999 May. The spectra are fit
to a model including multicolor blackbody disk and power-law components. The
source is observed in the very high and high/soft outburst states of black hole
X-ray novae. During the very high state, when the power-law component dominated
the spectrum, the inner disk radius is observed to vary by more than an order
of magnitude; the radius decreased by a factor of 16 in one day during a 6.8
Crab flare. If the larger of these observed radii is taken to be the last
stable orbit, then the smaller observed radius would imply that the inner edge
of the disk is inside the event horizon! However, we conclude that the apparent
variations of the inner disk radius observed during periods of increased
power-law emission are probably caused by the failure of the multicolor
disk/power-law model; the actual physical radius of the inner disk may remain
fairly constant. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the observed
inner disk radius remains approximately constant over 120 days in the high
state, when the power-law component is weak, even though the disk flux and
total flux vary by an order of magnitude. The mass of the black hole inferred
by equating the approximately constant inner disk radius observed in the

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0007064v2,Self-Similar Hot Accretion Flow onto a Neutron Star,"  We consider hot, two-temperature, viscous accretion onto a rotating,
unmagnetized neutron star. We assume Coulomb coupling betweenthe protons and
electrons, and free-free cooling from the electrons. We show that the accretion
flow has an extended settling region which can be described by means of two
analytical self-similar solutions: a two-temperature solution which is valid in
an inner zone, r<10^{2.5}, where r is the radius in Schwarzchild units; and a
one-temperature solution which is valid in an outer zone, r>10^{2.5}. In both
zones the density varies as \rho ~ r^{-2} and the angular velocity as \Omega ~
r^{-3/2}. We solve the flow equations numerically and confirm that the
analytical solutions are accurate. The settling flow radiates the energy
dissipated by viscosity; so it is not advection-dominated. Except for the
radial velocity, all other gas properties - density, angular velocity,
temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux - are independent of the mass
accretion rate; these quantities do depend sensitively on the spin of the
neutron star. The angular momentum flux is outward under most conditions;
therefore, the central star is nearly always spun-down. The luminosity of the
settling zone arises from the rotational energy that is released as the star is
braked by viscosity, and the contribution from gravity is small; hence the
radiative efficiency can be arbitrarily large at low $\mdot$. For reasonable
values of the gas adiabatic index, the Bernoulli parameter is negative;
therefore, a strong outflow or wind is not expected. The flow is convectively
stable, but may be thermally unstable. The described solution is not
advection-dominated; however, when the spin of the star is small enough, it
transforms smoothly to an advection-dominated branch of solution.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102003v2,"Resolving the Image of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows with Gravitational
  Microlensing","  Microlensing of a gamma-ray burst afterglow by an intervening star can be
used to infer the radial structure of the afterglow image. Near the peak of the
microlensing event, the outer edge of the image is more highly magnified than
its central region, whereas the situation is reversed at later times due to the
rapid radial expansion of the image on the sky. Thus, the microlensed afterglow
light curve can be inverted to recover the self-similar radial intensity
profile of the afterglow image. We calculate the expected errors in the
recovered intensity profile as a function of the number of resolution elements,
under the assumption that the afterglow and microlensing event parameters are
known. For a point-mass lens and uniform source, we derive a simple scaling
relation between these parameters and the resultant errors. The afterglow need
not be monitored for its entire duration; rather, observations from the peak
magnification time t_p of the microlensing event until 7 t_p are sufficient to
resolve the majority of the image. Thus, microlensing events can be alerted by
relatively infrequent observations of afterglows and then monitored
intensively, without significant loss of information about the afterglow
intensity profile. The relative intensity profile of about 1% of all afterglows
can be measured with 10 resolution elements to an accuracy of 1% in the optical
and 10% in the infrared, using 4m-class telescopes. Weak microlensing events
with large impact parameters are more common; we estimate that for about 10% of
afterglows the image profile may be inverted to a fractional accuracy 20%
through frequent optical observations. We also calculate the effects of
external shear due to the host galaxy or a binary companion, and contamination
by background light from the host galaxy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105372v2,Constraints on Thermal Emission Models of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars,"  Thermal emission from the surface of an ultramagnetic neutron star is
believed to contribute significantly to the soft X-ray flux of the Anomalous
X-ray Pulsars. We compare the detailed predictions of models of the surface
emission from a magnetar to the observed properties of AXPs. In particular, we
focus on the combination of their luminosities and energy-dependent pulsed
fractions. We use the results of recent calculations for strongly magnetized
atmospheres to obtain the angle- and energy-dependence of the surface emission.
We include in our calculations the effects of general relativistic photon
transport and interstellar extinction. We find that the combination of the
large pulsed fractions and the high luminosities of AXPs cannot be accounted
for by surface emission from a magnetar with two antipodal hot regions or a
temperature distribution characteristic of a magnetic dipole. This result is
robust for reasonable neutron star radii, for the range of magnetic field
strengths inferred from the observed spin down rates, and for surface
temperatures consistent with the spectral properties of AXPs. Models with a
single hot emitting region can reproduce the observations, provided that the
distance to one of the sources is ~30% less than the current best estimate, and
allowing for systematic uncertainties in the spectral fit of a second source.
Finally, the thermal emission models with antipodal emission geometry predict a
characteristic strong increase of the pulsed fraction with photon energy, which
is apparently inconsistent with the current data. The energy-dependence of the
pulsed fraction in the models with one hot region shows a wider range of
behavior and can be consistent with the existing data. Upcoming high-resolution
observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton will provide a conclusive test.

major outburst of 1998-1999, we have analyzed the X-ray power spectra, phase
lags, and coherence functions. The phase lags and coherence measures are used
to distinguish three types of low-frequency QPOs (one more than those reported
by Wijnands, Homan, & van der Klis 1999). For the most common type, the phase
lag is correlated with both the QPO frequency and the amplitude. The physical
significance of the QPO types is evident in the relationships between QPO
properties and the apparent temperature and flux from the accretion disk. There
is also a clear pattern in how the QPO types relate to the presence of
high-frequency QPOs. In general, both the amplitude and the Q value
(freq./FWHM) of low-frequency QPOs decrease as the high-frequency oscillations
increase in frequency (100 to 284 Hz) and in Q value. We speculate that the
antagonism between low-frequency and high-frequency QPOs arises from competing
structures in a perturbed accretion disk. However, we find that the frequencies
of slow (< 20 Hz) and fast (> 100 Hz) QPOs are not correlated. In addition, we
encounter systematic problems in attempting to reliably compare the QPO
frequencies with broad features in the power continuum, since there are a
variable number of such features in the power spectra. These results cast some
doubt on the reported global relationship between QPOs from neutrons stars and
those from black hole systems.

binary system that show a spatially resolved two-sided jet and an unresolved
central source. This is the first published report of such an x-ray jet seen in
an evolved stellar system comprised of ~2-3 solar masses. At E < 1 keV, the
x-ray jet extends both to the northeast and southwest relative to the central
binary system. At 1 < E < 7.1 keV, R Aqr is a point-like source centered on the
star system. While both 3.5-cm radio continuum emission and x-ray emission
appear coincident in projection and have maximum intensities at ~7.5"" northeast
of the central binary system, the next strongest x-ray component is located
\~30"" southwest of the central binary system and has no radio continuum
counterpart. The x-ray jets are likely shock heated in the recent past, and are
not in thermal equilibrium. The strongest southwest x-ray jet component may
have been shocked recently since there is no relic radio emission as expected
from an older shock. At the position of the central binary, we detect x-ray
emission below 1.6 keV consistent with blackbody emission at T ~2 x 10^6 K. At
the central star there is also a prominent 6.4 keV feature, a possible
fluorescence or collisionally excited Fe K-alpha line from an accretion disk or
from the wind of the giant star. For this excitation to occur, there must be an
unseen hard source of x-rays or particles in the immediate vicinity of the hot

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203065v1,The Reddest Quasars II. A gravitationally-lensed FeLoBAL quasar,"  We report the discovery of a z=2.65 low-ionization iron broad absorption line
quasar, FIRST J100424.9+122922, which is gravitationally-lensed by a galaxy at
z~0.95. The object was discovered as part of a program to find very red quasars
by matching the FIRST radio survey with the 2-MASS near-infrared survey.
J100424.9+122922 is the second lensed system to be found in this program,
suggesting that many gravitational lenses are probably missed from conventional
optical quasar surveys. We have made a simple lens model and a rough estimate
of the reddening in the immediate environment of the quasar which suggests that
the quasar is intrinsically very luminous and is accreting at close to the
Eddington limit of its ~10^9 M_sun black hole. The lensing galaxy has a small
amount of dust which is responsible for some excess reddening observed in the
fainter image of the quasar, but is otherwise a fairly typical massive
elliptical galaxy. We model the selection effects working against the detection
of red quasars in both lensed and unlensed samples. We show that these
selection effects are very effective at removing even lightly-reddened high
redshift quasars from magnitude-limited samples, whether they are lensed or
not. This suggests that the red quasar population in general could be very
large, and in particular the class of iron broad absorption line quasars of
which J100424.9+122922 is a member may be much larger than their rarity in
magnitude-limited samples would suggest.

  in Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts","  We present a comprehensive observational and theoretical analysis of the
amplitudes and profiles of oscillations that occur during thermonuclear X-ray
bursts from weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. Our
sample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer. The oscillations that we examined occurred primarily during
the decaying portions of bursts, and lasted for several seconds each. We find
that the oscillations are as large as 15% during the declines of the bursts,
and they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractional
amplitudes. However, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the
underlying flux in the burst. We derive folded profiles for each oscillation
train to study the pulse morphologies. The mean rms amplitudes of the
oscillations are 5%, although the eclipsing source MXB 1659-298 routinely
produces 10% oscillations in weak bursts. We also produce combined profiles
from all of the oscillations from each source. Using these pulse profiles, we
place upper limits on the fractional amplitudes of harmonic and half-frequency
signals of 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively (95% confidence). We then compare the
pulse morphologies to theoretical profiles from models with one or two
antipodal bright regions on the surface of a rotating neutron star. We find
that if one bright region is present on the star, it must either lie near the
rotational pole or cover nearly half the neutron star in order to be consistent
with the observed lack of harmonic signals. If an antipodal pattern is present,
the hot regions must form very near the rotational equator. We discuss how
these geometric constraints challenge current models for the production of
brightness variations on the surface of a neutron star. (abridged)

Galaxies (LBGs) in the region of the Hubble Deep Field North, derived from the
1 Ms public Chandra observation. Of our sample of 148 LBGs, four are detected
individually. This immediately gives a measure of the bright AGN fraction in
these galaxies of $\sim 3$~per cent, which is in agreement with that derived
from the UV spectra. The X-ray color of the detected sources indicates that
they are probably moderately obscured. Stacking of the remainder shows a
significant detection ($6\sigma$) with an average luminosity of $3.5 \times
10^{41}$~erg s$^{-1}$ per galaxy in the rest frame 2-10 keV band. We have also
studied a comparison sample of 95 z$\sim 1$ ``Balmer Break'' galaxies. Eight of
these are detected directly, with at least two clear AGN based on their high
X-ray luminosity and very hard X-ray spectra respectively. The remainder are of
relatively low luminosity ($<10^{42}$~erg s$^{-1}$), and the X-rays could arise
from either AGN or rapid star-formation. The X-ray colors and evidence from
other wavebands favor the latter interpretation. Excluding the clear AGN, we
deduce a mean X-ray luminosity of $6.6 \times 10^{40}$~erg s$^{-1}$, a factor
$\sim 5$ lower than the LBGs. The average ratio of the UV and X-ray
luminosities of these starforming galaxies $L_{\rm UV}/L_{\rm X}$, however, is
approximately the same at $z = 1$ as it is at $z = 3$. This scaling implies
that the X-ray emission follows the current star formation rate, as measured by
the UV luminosity. We use our results to constrain the star formation rate at

ionizing radiation fields produced by stars and quasars. For the quasars we use
a model based on halo-merger rates that reproduces all known properties of the
quasar luminosity function at high redshifts. The less constrained properties
of the ionizing radiation produced by stars are modeled with two free
parameters: (i) a transition redshift, z_tran, above which the stellar
population is dominated by massive, zero-metallicity stars and below which it
is dominated by a Scalo mass function; (ii) the product of the escape fraction
of stellar ionizing photons from their host galaxies and the star-formation
efficiency, f_esc f_*. We constrain the allowed range of these free parameters
at high redshifts based on the lack of the HI Gunn-Peterson trough at z<6 and
the upper limit on the total intergalactic optical depth for electron
scattering, tau_es<0.18, from recent cosmic microwave background (CMB)
experiments. We find that quasars ionize helium by a redshift z~4, but cannot
reionize hydrogen by themselves before z~6. A major fraction of the allowed
combinations of f_esc f_* and z_tran lead to an early peak in the ionized
fraction due to metal-free stars at high redshifts. This sometimes results in
two reionization epochs, namely an early HII or HeIII overlap phase followed by
recombination and a second overlap phase. Even if early overlap is not
achieved, the peak in the visibility function for scattering of the CMB often
coincides with the early ionization phase rather than with the actual
reionization epoch. Consequently, tau_es does not correspond directly to the
reionization redshift. We generically find values of tau_es>7%, that should be
detectable by the MAP satellite.

Chandra reveals sub-arcsecond structure, both in the brightness and in spectral
variations. Underlying these small-scale variations is a surprisingly simple
radial structure in the equivalent widths of the strong Si and S emission
lines. We investigate these radial variations through spatially resolved
spectroscopy using a plane-parallel, non-equilibrium ionization model with
multiple components. The majority of the emission arises from components with a
temperature of 1 keV: a fully ionized hydrogen component; a high ionization
timescale (n_e*t > 10^12 s cm^-3) component containing Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe;
and a low ionization timescale (n_e*t ~ 10^{11} s cm^-3) O, Ne, and Mg
component. To reproduce the strong Fe Kalpha line, it is necessary to include
additional Fe in a hot (> 2 keV), low ionization (n_e*t ~ 10^10.8 s cm^-3)
component. This hot Fe may be in the form of hot Fe bubbles, formed in the
radioactive decay of clumps of 56Ni. We find no radial variation in the
ionization timescales or temperatures of the various components. Rather, the Si
and S equivalent widths increase at large radii because these lines, as well as
those of Ar and Ca, are formed in a shell occupying the outer half of the
remnant. A shell of hot Fe is located interior to this, but there is a large
region of overlap between these two shells. In the inner 30% of the remnant,
there is a core of cooler, 1 keV Fe. We find that the distribution of the
ejecta and the yields of the intermediate mass species are consistent with
model prediction for Type Ia events.

star cluster formation histories of the Mice and the Tadpole interacting
galaxies. In each interacting system we find some 40 bright young star clusters

tidal tails and spiral arms. We estimate that the main events triggering the
formation of these clusters occurred ~(1.5-2.0) x 10^8 yr ago. We show that
star cluster formation is a major mode of star formation in galaxy
interactions, with >= 35% of the active star formation in encounters occurring
in star clusters. This is the first time that young star clusters have been
detected along the tidal tails in interacting galaxies. The tidal tail of the
Tadpole system is dominated by blue star forming regions, which occupy some 60%
of the total area covered by the tail and contribute ~70% of the total flux in

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211298v1,Fitting Together the HI Absorption and Emission in the SGPS,"  In this paper we study 21-cm absorption spectra and the corresponding
emission spectra toward bright continuum sources in the test region (326deg< l
< 333 deg) of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. This survey combines the high
resolution of the Australia Telescope Compact Array with the full brightness
temperature information of the Parkes single dish telescope. In particular, we
focus on the abundance and temperature of the cool atomic clouds in the inner
galaxy. The resulting mean opacity of the HI, <kappa>, is measured as a
function of Galactic radius; it increases going in from the solar circle, to a
peak in the molecular ring of about four times its local value. This suggests
that the cool phase is more abundant there, and colder, than it is locally.
  The distribution of cool phase temperatures is derived in three different
ways. The naive, ``spin temperature'' technique overestimates the cloud
temperatures, as expected. Using two alternative approaches we get good
agreement on a histogram of the cloud temperatures, T(cool), corrected for
blending with warm phase gas. The median temperature is about 65 K, but there
is a long tail reaching down to temperatures below 20 K. Clouds with
temperatures below 40 K are common, though not as common as warmer clouds (40
to 100 K).
  Using these results we discuss two related quantities, the peak brightness
temperature seen in emission surveys, and the incidence of clouds seen in HI
self-absorption. Both phenomena match what would be expected based on our
measurements of <kappa> and T(cool).

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212310v2,Gravitational Lensing by a Compound Population of Halos: Standard Models,"  Based on observed rotation curves of galaxies and theoretical simulations of
dark matter halos, there are reasons for believing that at least three
different types of dark matter halos exist in the Universe classified by their
masses M and the inner slope of mass density -\alpha: Population A (galaxies):
10^{10} h^{-1} M_\odot < M < 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot, \alpha = 2;
Population B (cluster halos): M > 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot, \alpha =
1.3; and Population C (dwarf halos): M < 10^{10} h^{-1} M_\odot, \alpha = 1.3.
In this paper we calculate the lensing probability produced by such a compound
population of dark halos, for both image separation and time delay, assuming
that the mass function of halos is given by the Press-Schechter function and
the Universe is described by an LCDM, OCDM, or SCDM model. The LCDM model is
normalized to the WMAP observations, OCDM and SCDM models are normalized to the
abundance of rich clusters. We compare the predictions of the different
cosmological models with observational data and show that, both LCDM and OCDM
models are marginally consistent with the current available data, but the SCDM
model is ruled out. The fit of the compound model to the observed correlation
between splitting angle and time delay is excellent but the fit to the number
vs splitting angle relation is only adequate using the small number of sources
in the objective JVAS/CLASS survey. A larger survey of the same type would have
great power in discriminating among cosmological models. Furthermore,
population C in an LCDM model has a unique signature in the time domain, an
additional peak at ~3 seconds potentially observable in GRBs, which makes it
distinguishable from variants of CDM scenarios, such as warm dark matter,
repulsive dark matter, or collisional dark matter.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212503v2,"Disk Accretion Flow Driven by Large-Scale Magnetic Fields: Solutions
  with Constant Specific Energy","  (Abridged) We study the dynamical evolution of a stationary, axisymmetric,
and perfectly conducting cold accretion disk containing a large-scale magnetic
field around a Kerr black hole, trying to understand the relation between
accretion and the transportation of angular momentum and energy. We solve the
radial momentum equation for solutions corresponding to an accretion flow that
starts from a subsonic state at infinity, smoothly passes the fast critical
point, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The
solutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid
particles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively
removed by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is
dominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is
equipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the
fast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the
electromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The
results indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy
dissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot
of energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity
is small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation
of the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the
rotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk. This is
in contrast with the evolution of small-scale magnetic fields where if the
resistivity is nonzero the magnetic energy density is likely to be
equipartitioned with the kinetic energy density associated with local random
motions (e.g., turbulence), making a thin Keplerian disk possible.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304292v3,Halo Substructure And The Power Spectrum,"  (ABRIDGED) We present a semi-analytic model to explore merger histories,
destruction rates, and survival probabilities of substructure in dark matter
halos and use it to study the substructure populations of galaxy-sized halos as
a function of the power spectrum. We successfully reproduce the subhalo
velocity function and radial distribution seen in N-body simulations for
standard LCDM. We explore the implications of spectra with normalizations and
tilts spanning sigma_8 = 0.65-1 and n = 0.8-1. We also study a running index
(RI) model with dn/dlnk=-0.03, as discussed in the first year WMAP report, and
several WDM models with masses m_W = 0.75, 1.5, 3.0 keV. The substructure mass
fraction is relatively insensitive to the tilt and overall normalization of the
power spectrum. All CDM-type models yield projected substructure mass fractions
that are consistent with, but on the low side of, estimates from strong lens
systems: f = 0.4-1.5% (64 percentile) in systems M_sub < 10^9 Msun. Truncated
models produce significantly smaller fractions and are disfavored by lensing
results. We compare our predicted subhalo velocity functions to the dwarf
satellite population of the Milky Way. Assuming isotropic velocity dispersions,
we find the standard n=1 model overpredicts the number of MW satellites as
expected. Models with less small-scale power are more successful because there
are fewer subhalos of a given circular velocity and the mapping between
observed velocity dispersion and halo circular velocity is markedly altered.
The RI model, or a fixed tilt with sigma_8=0.75, can account for the MW dwarfs
without the need for differential feedback; however, these comparisons depend
sensitively on the assumption of isotropic velocities in satellite galaxies.

source G357.7-0.1 (the ""Tornado""). Observations made with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory demonstrate the presence of up to three sources of X-ray emission
from the Tornado: a relatively bright region of dimensions 2'x1' coincident
with and interior to the brightest radio emission at the ""head"" of the Tornado,
plus two fainter extended regions possibly associated with the Tornado's
""tail"". No X-ray point sources associated with the Tornado are seen down to a
3-sigma luminosity (0.5-10 keV) of 1e33 ergs/s, for a distance to the system of
12 kpc. The spectrum of the brightest region of X-rays is consistent with a
heavily absorbed (N_H ~ 1e23 cm^-2) thermal plasma of temperature kT ~ 0.6 keV;
an absorbed power law can also fit the data, but implies an extremely steep
photon index. From these data we tentatively conclude that the Tornado is a
supernova remnant (SNR), although we are unable to rule out the possibility
that the Tornado is powered either by outflows from an X-ray binary or by the
relativistic wind of an unseen pulsar. Within the SNR interpretation, the head
of the Tornado is a limb-brightened radio shell containing centrally-filled
thermal X-rays and which is interacting with a molecular cloud. We therefore
propose that the Tornado is a ""mixed morphology"" supernova remnant. The unusual
tail component of the Tornado remains unexplained in this interpretation, but
might result from expansion of the SNR into an elongated progenitor wind
bubble.

with the CTIO 1.3--meter telescope and the ANDICAM instrument, a dual
optical/infrared imager with a dichroic centered at one micron. Without the
need for light curve interpolation to produce snapshot broadband spectra, we
show that the transient spectrum remained statistically achromatic from day 2.7

early epochs with the GRB afterglow, we infer a modest level of extinction due
to the host galaxy in the line--of--sight toward the GRB: A_V(host) = 0.30 +/-
0.03 mag for beta = -0.5 and A_V(host) < 0.4 mag (3 sigma) for any physically
plausible value of beta (with flux f_nu ~ lambda^-beta). We conclude that the
spectral slope of the afterglow component was more than beta = -0.8 between day
2.7-5.6 after the GRB, excluding the possibility that the synchrotron cooling
break passed through the optical/IR bandpass over that period. Taking
extinction into account, a decomposition of the light curve into an afterglow
and supernova component requires the presence of a supernova similar to that of
SN 1998bw, an afterglow that shows some evidence for a second break around day
8-10, and a fifth re-brightening event around day 15. Assuming an SN
1988bw-like evolution and a contemporaneous GRB and SN event, the peak SN

100 keV. The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) will employ
relatively thick (5 - 10 mm) CZT detectors, which are required to perform the
broad energy-band sky survey. Interaction depth information is needed to
correct events to the detector ""focal plane"" for correct imaging and can be
used to improve the energy resolution of the detector at high energies by
allowing event-based corrections for incomplete charge collection. Background
rejection is also improved by allowing low energy events from the rear and
sides of the detector to be rejected. We present experimental results of
interaction depth sensing in a 5 mm thick pixellated Au-contact IMARAD CZT
detector. The depth sensing was done by making simultaneous measurements of
cathode and anode signals, where the interaction depth at a given energy is
proportional to the ratio of cathode/anode signals. We demonstrate how a simple
empirical formula describing the event distributions in the cathode/anode
signal space can dramatically improve the energy resolution. We also estimate
the energy and depth resolution of the detector as a function of the energy and
the interaction depth. We also show a depth-sensing prototype system currently
under development for EXIST in which cathode signals from 8, 16 or 32 crystals
can be read-out by a small multi-channel ASIC board that is vertically
edge-mounted on the cathode electrode along every second CZT crystal boundary.
This allows CZT crystals to be tiled contiguously with minimum impact on

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0311514v2,21 Centimeter Fluctuations from Cosmic Gas at High Redshifts,"  The relatively large Thomson optical depth, tau_e, inferred recently from the
WMAP observations suggests that the Universe was reionized in a more complex
manner than previously believed. However, the value of tau_e provides only an
integral constraint on the history of reionization and, by itself, cannot be
used to determine the nature of the sources responsible for this transition.
Here, we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic
medium at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21
centimeter radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical
description of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a
formalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both
frequency and angular scale. Prior to and following reionization, fluctuations
in the 21 cm signal are mediated by density perturbations in the distribution
of matter. Between these epochs, pockets of gas surrounding luminous objects
become ionized, producing large HII regions. These ``bubbles'' of ionized
material imprint features into the 21 cm power spectrum that make it possible
to distinguish them from fluctuations produced by the density perturbations.
The variation of the power spectrum with frequency can be used to infer the
evolution of this process. As has been emphasized previously by others, the
absolute 21 cm signal from neutral gas at high redshifts is undetectable owing
to contamination by foreground sources. However, we argue that this source of
noise can be suppressed by comparing maps closely spaced in frequency, i.e.
redshift, so that 21 cm fluctuations from the IGM can be measured against a
much brighter, but smoothly varying (in frequency) background.

Mrk348. The line is redshifted by about 130 km s^-1 with respect to the
systemic velocity, is extremely broad, with a FWHM of 130 km s^-1, and has no
detectable high velocity components within 1500 km s^-1 on either side of the
observed line. The unusual line profile led us to suspect that this source,
might belong to a class of megamaser galaxies in which the amplified emission
is the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching
molecular cloud, rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk. Our initial
VLBA observations show that the maser emission emanates entirely from a region
<0.25 pc in extent, located toward a continuum component thought to be
associated with the receding jet. The very high linewidth occurring on such
small spatial scales and the rapid variability indicate that the H_2O emission
is likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic
jet material and the molecular gas in the cloud where the jet is boring
through. The orientation of the radio jets close to the plane of the sky also
results in shocks with the preferred orientation for strong masers from our
vantage point. Single-dish monitoring with the Effelsberg 100m telescope showed
that the line and continuum emission ""flared"" on very similar timescales. The
close temporal correlation between this activity in the maser emission and the
continuum flare further suggest that the masing region and the continuum
hotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different
manifestations of the same dynamical events.

matter haloes with a suite of cosmological N-body simulations and use our
results to test analytic models. We consider constant equation of state models,
and allow both w>-1 and w<-1. Using five simulations with w ranging from -1.5
to -0.5, and with more than ~1600 well-resolved haloes each, we show that the
halo concentration model of Bullock et al. (2001) accurately predicts the
median concentrations of haloes over the range of w, halo masses, and redshifts
that we are capable of probing. We find that the Bullock et al. (2001) model
works best when halo masses and concentrations are defined relative to an outer
radius set by a cosmology-dependent virial overdensity. For a fixed power
spectrum normalization and fixed-mass haloes, larger values of w lead to higher
concentrations and higher halo central densities, both because collapse occurs
earlier and because haloes have higher virial densities. While precise
predictions of halo densities are quite sensitive to various uncertainties, we
make broad comparisons to galaxy rotation curve data. At fixed power spectrum
normalization (fixed sigma_8), w>-1 quintessence models seem to exacerbate the
central density problem relative to the standard w=-1 model. Meanwhile w<-1
models help to reduce the apparent discrepancy. We confirm that the Jenkins et
al. (2001) halo mass function provides an excellent approximation to the
abundance of haloes in our simulations and extend its region of validity to
include models with w<-1.

the highly ionized plasma responsible for the absorption lines is located in a

sight during dipping. We also report the discovery of a 0.98 keV absorption
edge in the persistent emission spectrum. The edge energy decreases to 0.87 keV

survey aimed at identifying highly-magnified Lyman-break galaxies in the fields
of intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the source had U>24.7 (2-sigma;
AB), g=21.96, and very blue g-r and r-i colors; i.e., PALS1 was a U-band
drop-out, characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at z~3. However,
three months later the source had faded by more than three magnitudes. Further
observations showed a continued decline in luminosity, to R>26.4 seven months
after discovery. Though the apparent brightness is suggestive of a supernova at
roughly the cluster redshift, we show that the photometry and light curve argue
against any known type of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy
distribution and location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent
with the hypothesis that PALS1 is a gravitationally-lensed transient at z~3.3.
If this interpretation is correct, the source is magnified by a factor of 4-7
and two counterimages are predicted. Our lens model predicts time delays
between the three images of 1-10 years and that we have witnessed the final
occurrence of the transient. The intense luminosity (M(AB) ~ -23.5 after

source may have been a flare resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a
10^6-10^8 solar-mass black hole. Regardless of its physical nature, PALS1
highlights the importance of monitoring regions of high magnification in galaxy

average. We also express our observations in terms of the SZ flux-temperature
relation, and compare it with other observations, as well as numerical studies.
  Based on its spectral and spatial signature, we can also extract the
microwave point source signal of the clusters at the 3-sigma level, which puts
the average microwave luminosity (at ~ 41 GHz) of bright cluster members (M_K <
-21) at (2.4 +/- 0.8) x 10^{27} h^{-2} erg/s/Hz. Furthermore, we can constrain
the average dark matter halo concentration parameter to c_{vir}=3.4+0.6-0.9,
for clusters with T_x > 5 kev.
  Our work serves as an example for how correlation of SZ surveys with cluster
surveys in other frequencies can significantly increase our physical
understanding of the intra-cluster medium.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409436v2,Black holes in galaxy mergers: The formation of red elliptical galaxies,"  We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced
by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) during major mergers of
spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation,
and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto
supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We
assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black
hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that
regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers
nuclear gas inflow which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole
accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN
feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short
timescale,particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive
powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of
the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black
holes. Without AGN, gas-rich mergers lead to ellipticals which remain blue
owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyrs have elapsed. In
contrast, mergers with black holes produce ellipticals that redden much faster,
an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete
termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r ~ 2.3 in
less than one Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population
of extremely red massive early type-galaxies, and it appears to be an important
driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the
Local Universe.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411344v1,Massive galaxies at redshift 2 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations,"  We study the properties of galaxies at z=2 in a Lambda cold dark matter
universe, using two different types of hydrodynamic simulation methods --
Eulerian TVD and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) -- and a
spectrophotometric analysis in the U_n, G, R filter set. The simulated galaxies
at z=2 satisfy the color-selection criteria proposed by Adelberger et al.
(2004) and Steidel et al. (2004) when we assume Calzetti extinction with
E(B-V)=0.15. We find that the number density of simulated galaxies brighter
than R<25.5 at z=2 is about 1e-2 h^3 Mpc^-3 for E(B-V)=0.15, which is roughly
twice that of the number density found by Erb et al. (2004) for the UV bright
sample. This suggests that roughly half of the massive galaxies with M*>10^{10}
Msun/h at z=2 are UV bright population, and the other half is bright in the
infra-red wavelengths. The most massive galaxies at z=2 have stellar masses >=
10^{11-12} Msun. They typically have been continuously forming stars with a
rate exceeding 30 Msun/yr over a few Gyrs from z=10 to z=2, together with
significant contribution by starbursts reaching up to 1000 Msun/yr which lie on
top of the continuous component. TVD simulations indicate a more sporadic star
formation history than the SPH simulations. Our results do not imply that
hierarchical galaxy formation fails to account for the observed massive
galaxies at z>=1. The global star formation rate density in our simulations
peaks at z>=5, a much higher redshift than predicted by the semianalytic
models. This star formation history suggests early build-up of the stellar mass
density, and predicts that 70 (50, 30)% of the total stellar mass at z=0 had
already been formed by z=1 (2, 3). Upcoming observations by Spitzer and Swift
might help to better constrain the star formation history at high redshift.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412193v2,"Bypass to Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Accretion Disks: An Eigenvalue
  Approach","  Cold accretion disks such as those in star-forming systems, quiescent
cataclysmic variables, and some active galactic nuclei, are expected to have
neutral gas which does not couple well to magnetic fields. The turbulent
viscosity in such disks must be hydrodynamic in origin, not
magnetohydrodynamic. We investigate the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in
a linear shear flow sandwiched between two parallel walls. The unperturbed flow
is similar to plane Couette flow but with a Coriolis force included. Although
there are no exponentially growing eigenmodes in this system, nevertheless,
because of the non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, it is possible to have a
large transient growth in the energy of perturbations. For a constant angular
momentum disk, we find that the perturbation with maximum growth has a
wave-vector in the vertical direction. The energy grows by more than a factor
of 100 for a Reynolds number R=300 and more than a factor of 1000 for R=1000.
Turbulence can be easily excited in such a disk, as found in previous numerical
simulations. For a Keplerian disk, on the other hand, similar vertical
perturbations grow by no more than a factor of 4, explaining why the same
simulations did not find turbulence in this system. However, certain other
two-dimensional perturbations with no vertical structure do exhibit modest
growth. For the optimum two-dimensional perturbation, the energy grows by a
factor of ~100 for R~10^4.5 and by a factor of 1000 for R~10^6. It is
conceivable that these two-dimensional disturbances might lead to
self-sustained turbulence. The Reynolds numbers of cold astrophysical disks are
much larger even than 10^6, therefore, hydrodynamic turbulence may be possible
in disks.

  Energy Growth","  Despite observational evidence for cold neutral astrophysical accretion
disks, the viscous process which may drive the accretion in such systems is not
yet understood. While molecular viscosity is too small to explain the observed
accretion efficiencies by more than ten orders of magnitude, the absence of any
linear instability in Keplerian accretion flows is often used to rule out the
possibility of turbulent viscosity. Recently, the fact that some fine tuned
disturbances of any inviscid shear flow can reach arbitrarily large transient
growth has been proposed as an alternative route to turbulence in these
systems. We present an analytic study of this process for 3D plane wave
disturbances of a general rotating shear flow in Lagrangian coordinates, and
demonstrate that large transient growth is the generic feature of
non-axisymmetric disturbances with near radial leading wave vectors. The
maximum energy growth is slower than quadratic, but faster than linear in time.
The fastest growth occurs for two dimensional perturbations, and is only
limited by viscosity, and ultimately by the disk vertical thickness.
  After including viscosity and vertical structure, we find that, as a function
of the Reynolds number, R, the maximum energy growth is approximately 0.4
(R/log R)^{2/3}, and put forth a heuristic argument for why R > 10^4 is
required to sustain turbulence in Keplerian disks. Therefore, assuming that
there exists a non-linear feedback process to replenish the seeds for transient
growth, astrophysical accretion disks must be well within the turbulent regime.
However, large 3D numerical simulations running for many orbital times, and/or
with fine tuned initial conditions, are required to confirm Keplerian
hydrodynamic turbulence on the computer.

high redshift which are challenging to explain in hierarchical galaxy formation
models. We analyze this ``massive galaxy problem'' with two different types of
hydrodynamic simulations -- Eulerian TVD and SPH -- of a concordance Lambda CDM
universe. We consider two separate but connected aspects of the problem posed
by these extremely red objects (EROs): (1) the mass-scale, and (2) red colors.
We perform spectrophotometric analyses of simulated galaxies in B, z, R, I, Js,
Ks, K filters, and compare their near-IR properties with observations at
redshift z=1-3. We find that the simulated galaxies brighter than the magnitude
limit of K_vega=20 mag have stellar masses Mstar >= 10^{11} Msun/h and a number
density of a few \times 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} at z~2, in good agreement with the
observed number density in the K20 survey. Therefore, our hydrodynamic
simulations do not exhibit the ``mass-scale problem''. The answer to the
``redness problem'' is less clear because of our poor knowledge of the amount
of dust extinction in EROs and the uncertain fraction of star-forming EROs.
However, our simulations can account for the observed comoving number density
of ~ 1e-4 Mpc^{-3} at z=1-2 if we assume a uniform extinction of E(B-V)=0.4 for
the entire population of simulated galaxies. The critical question of the
existence of a significant population of old, passively evolving massive EROs
should continue to be tested with future hydrodynamic simulations. Upcoming
observations of the thermal emission of dust in 24 micron by the Spitzer Space
Telescope will help to better estimate the dust content of EROs at z=1-3, and
thus to further constrain the star formation history of the Universe, and
theoretical models of galaxy formation. (abridged)

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502241v1,A Physical Model for the Origin of Quasar Lifetimes,"  We propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which observational quasar
lifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are strongly
distinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.
Quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part of
the accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities powering
accretion. In this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but the
quasar is buried. Eventually, feedback from accretion energy disperses
surrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observable
optically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required to
maintain a quasar luminosity. We model this process and measure the unobscured
and intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxy
merger. The source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,
calculated from local gas properties. We calculate the column density of
hydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these column
densities and gas metallicities to determine B-band attenuation of the source.
Defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observed
B-band luminosity above some limit L_B,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 Myr for
L_B,min=10^11 L_sun (M_B=-23), in good agreement with observationally
determined quasar lifetimes. This is significantly smaller than the intrinsic
lifetime ~100 Myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. The ratio of observed
to intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosity
and the observed frequency.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504190v2,Black Holes in Galaxy Mergers: Evolution of Quasars,"  Based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a model
in which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassive
black holes in galaxies. Nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision
triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration
of the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas and
dust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and UV
wavelengths. Eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and
expels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. Between buried and dead
phases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous
quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of
obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this
phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed
luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a
function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10
Myr for bright quasars in the optical B-band, in good agreement with empirical
estimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 Myr,
naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. However,
observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands
as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We
obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the
quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees
remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from
the SDSS for appropriate luminosity thresholds. (Abridged)

  Quasar Luminosity Functions","  We consider implications of our new model of quasar lifetimes and light
curves for the quasar luminosity function (LF) at different frequencies and
redshifts. In our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and the lifetime depends on
both their instantaneous and peak luminosities. The bright end of the LF traces
the peak intrinsic quasar activity, but the faint end consists of quasars which
are either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the observed LF corresponds
directly to the maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities,
which falls off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. We study this model
using simulations of galaxy mergers which successfully reproduce a wide range
of observed quasar phenomena, including the observed column density
distribution. By combining quasar lifetimes and the distribution of maximum
quasar luminosities determined from the observed hard X-ray LF with the
corresponding luminosity and host-system dependent column densities, we produce
the expected soft X-ray and B-band LFs. Our predictions agree exceptionally
well with the observed LFs at all observed luminosities, over the redshift
range considered (z < 1), without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about an
obscured population of sources. Our results also suggest that observed
correlations in hard X-ray samples between the obscured fraction of quasars and
luminosity can be explained in the context of our model by the expulsion of
surrounding gas due to heating from accretion feedback energy as a quasar nears
its peak luminosity and final black hole mass.

parameters, but neither system actually shows unambiguous signatures of white
dwarf emission. The shape and flux of the spectrum of SS Cyg cannot be

arise from the disk, the line shapes indicate that surface fluxes fall roughly
as R^{-2} in both systems. Fits to the double-peaked line profiles in SS Cyg
indicate that the FUV line forming region is concentrated closer to the white

detected. Their radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions are similar,
except for PKS0941-080, which is X-ray under-luminous by about two orders of
magnitude. The comparison between the full sample of GPS galaxies with
measurements in hard X-rays and a control sample of radio galaxies rules out
intrinsic X-ray weakness as causing a lower detection rate of GPS sources in
X-ray surveys. Four out of seven GPS galaxies exhibit high X-ray column
densities, whereas for the remaining three this measurement is hampered by the
poor spectral statistics. Bearing in mind the low number statistics in both the

is larger than in FRI or Broad Line Region FR II radio galaxies, but consistent
with that measured in High-Excitation FRII galaxies. This leads to a location
the absorbing gas in an obscuring ``torus'', which prevents us from observing

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We vary both the wind strength and the
internal parameters of the the wind model in a series of cosmological SPH
simulations that include radiative cooling and heating by a UV background, star
formation, and feedback from supernovae and galactic winds. To test our
simulations, we examine the DLA `rate-of-incidence' as a function of halo mass,
galaxy apparent magnitude, and impact parameter. We find that the statistical
distribution of DLAs does not depend on the exact values of internal numerical
parameters that control the decoupling of hydrodynamic forces when the gas is
ejected from starforming regions. The DLA rate-of-incidence in our simulations
at z=3 is dominated by the faint galaxies with apparent magnitude R_AB < 25.5.
However, interestingly in a `strong wind' run, the differential distribution of
DLA sight-lines is peaked at Mhalo = 10^{12} Msun/h (R_AB~27), and the mean DLA
halo mass is Mmean=10^{12.4} Msun/h (R_AB ~ 26). These mass-scales are much
larger than those if we ignore winds, because galactic wind feedback suppresses
the DLA cross section in low-mass halos and increases the relative contribution
to the DLA incidence from more massive halos. The DLAs in our simulations are
more compact than the present-day disk galaxies, and the impact parameter
distribution is very narrow unless we limit the search for the host galaxy to
only bright LBGs. The comoving number density of DLAs is higher than that of

scale structure on the diffuse emission of 21 centimeter radiation from neutral
hydrogen at high redshifts during the era of reionization. The ability to
observe radial information through the frequency, and thus three-dimensional
regions of the background radiation at different redshifts, suggests that 21 cm
studies may provide a useful context for studying weak lensing effects. We
focus on the gravitational lensing effects on both the angular power spectra
and the intrinsic, three-dimensional power spectra. We present a new approach
for calculating the weak lensing signature based on integrating differential
Fourier-space shells of the deflection field and approximating the
magnification matrix. This method is applied to reionization models of the 21
cm spectra up to small angular scales over a range in redshift. The effect on
the angular power spectrum is typically < 1% on small angular scales, and very
small on scales corresponding to the feature imprinted by reionization bubbles,
due to the near-scale invariance of the angular power spectrum of the 21 cm
signal on these scales. We describe the expected effect of weak lensing on
three-dimensional 21 cm power spectra, and show that lensing creates aspherical
perturbations to the intrinsic power spectrum which depend on the polar angle
of the wavevector. The effect on the 3D power spectrum is < 1% on scales k <
0.1 h/Mpc, but can be > 1% for highly inclined modes for k > 1 h/Mpc. The
angular variation of the lensing effect on these scales is well described by a
quartic polynomial in the cosine of the polar angle. The detection of the

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512585v2,Birth and Evolution of Isolated Radio Pulsars,"  We investigate the birth and evolution of Galactic isolated radio pulsars. We
begin by estimating their birth space velocity distribution from proper motion
measurements of Brisken et al. (2002, 2003). We find no evidence for
multimodality of the distribution and favor one in which the absolute
one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially distributed and with a
three-dimensional mean velocity of 380^{+40}_{-60} km s^-1. We then proceed
with a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modelling the birth properties
of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and
Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We present a population model that appears
generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest that pulsars
are born in the spiral arms, with a Galactocentric radial distribution that is
well described by the functional form proposed by Yusifov & Kucuk (2004), in
which the pulsar surface density peaks at radius ~3 kpc. The birth spin period
distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of
multimodality. Models which assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to be
independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are inadequate, as they
lead to the detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations.
Dithered radio luminosities proportional to the square root of the spin-down
luminosity accommodate the observations well and provide a natural mechanism
for the pulsars to dim uniformly as they approach the death line, avoiding an
observed pile-up on the latter. There is no evidence for significant torque
decay (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the
pulsars as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate
and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.

  Galaxy Halos","  [Abridged] Motivated by upcoming data from astrometric and spectroscopic
surveys of the Galaxy, we explore the chemical abundance properties and
phase-space distributions in hierarchically-formed stellar halo simulations set
in a LambdaCDM Universe. Our sample of Milky-Way type stellar halo simulations
result in average metallicities that range from [Fe/H] = -1.3 to -0.9, with the
most metal poor halos resulting from accretion histories that lack destructive
mergers with massive (metal rich) satellites. Our stellar halo metallicities
increase with stellar halo mass. The slope of the [Fe/H]-stellar mass trend
mimics that of the satellite galaxies that were destroyed to build the halos,
implying that the relation propagates hierarchically. All simulated halos
contain a significant fraction of old stellar populations accreted more than 10
Gyr ago and in a few cases, some intermediate age populations exist. In
contrast with the Milky Way, many of our simulated stellar halos contain old
stellar populations which are metal rich, originating in the early accretion of
massive satellites. We suggest that the (metal rich) stellar halo of M31 falls
into this category, while the more metal poor halo of the Milky Way is lacking
in early massive accretion events. Interestingly, our hierarchically-formed
stellar halos often have non-negligible metallicity gradients in both [Fe/H]
and [alpha/Fe]. These gradients extend a few tens of kpc, and can be as large
as 0.5 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.2 dex in [alpha/Fe]. Finally, we find that chemical
abundances can act as a rough substitute for time of accretion of satellite
galaxies. We propose a criterion for identifying tidal streams spatially by
selecting stars with [alpha/Fe] ratios below solar.

formation or buildup of red sequence galaxies, as a function of mass and
redshift. Comparing this with the mass functions of mergers and quasar hosts,
and independently comparing their clustering properties as a function of
redshift, we find that these populations trace the same mass distribution, with
similar evolution, at redshifts 0<z<~1.5. Knowing one of the quasar, merger, or
elliptical mass/luminosity functions, it is possible to predict the others.
Allowing for greater model dependence, we compare the rate of early-type
buildup with the implied merger and quasar triggering rates as a function of
mass and redshift and find agreement. Over this redshift range, observed merger
fractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function and
buildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift
(>~10^11 M_solar at z<~0.3) where 'dry' mergers appear to dominate. This
supports a necessary prediction of theories where mergers between gas-rich
galaxies produce ellipticals with an associated phase of quasar activity, after
which the remnant becomes red. These populations trace a similar characteristic
transition mass, possibly reflecting the mass above which the elliptical
population is mostly (>~50%) assembled at a given redshift, which increases
with redshift over the observed range in a manner consistent with suggestions
that cosmic downsizing may apply to red galaxy assembly as well as star
formation. These mass distributions as a function of redshift do not uniformly
trace the all/red/blue galaxy population, ruling out models in which quasar
activity is generically associated with star formation or is long lived in
'old' systems.

system. Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) bear witness to coagulation physics, the
evolution of planetary orbits, and external perturbations from the solar
neighborhood. We critically review the present-day belt's observed properties
and the theories designed to explain them. Theories are organized according to
a possible time-line of events. In chronological order, epochs described
include (1) coagulation of KBOs in a dynamically cold disk, (2) formation of
binary KBOs by fragmentary collisions and gravitational captures, (3) stirring
of KBOs by Neptune-mass planets (``oligarchs''), (4) eviction of excess
oligarchs, (5) continued stirring of KBOs by remaining planets whose orbits
circularize by dynamical friction, (6) planetary migration and capture of
Resonant KBOs, (7) creation of the inner Oort cloud by passing stars in an open
stellar cluster, and (8) collisional comminution of the smallest KBOs. Recent
work underscores how small, collisional, primordial planetesimals having low
velocity dispersion permit the rapid assembly of ~5 Neptune-mass oligarchs at
distances of 15-25 AU. We explore the consequences of such a picture. We
propose that Neptune-mass planets whose orbits cross into the Kuiper belt for
up to ~20 Myr help generate the high-perihelion members of the hot Classical
disk and Scattered belt. By contrast, raising perihelia by sweeping secular
resonances during Neptune's migration might fill these reservoirs too
inefficiently when account is made of how little primordial mass might reside
in bodies having sizes of order 100 km. These and other frontier issues in
trans-Neptunian space are discussed quantitatively.

involving gas-rich galaxies, we study the relationship between quasars and the
population of merging galaxies and predict the merger-induced star formation
rate density of the Universe. Mergers drive nuclear gas inflows, fueling
starbursts and 'buried quasars' until accretion feedback expels the gas,
rendering a briefly visible optical quasar. Star formation is shut down and
accretion declines, leaving a passively evolving remnant with properties
typical of red, elliptical galaxies. Based on evolution of these events in our
simulations, we demonstrate that the observed statistics of merger rates,
luminosity functions (LFs) and mass functions, SFR distributions, specific
SFRs, quasar and quasar host galaxy LFs, and elliptical/red galaxy LFs are
self-consistent and follow from one another as predicted by the merger
hypothesis. We use our simulations to de-convolve both quasar and merging
galaxy LFs to determine the birthrate of black holes of a given final mass and
merger rates as a function of stellar mass. We use this to predict the merging
galaxy LF in several observed wavebands, color-magnitude relations, mass
functions, absolute and specific SFR distributions and SFR density, and quasar
host galaxy LFs, as a function of redshift from z=0-6. We invert this and
predict e.g. quasar LFs from observed merger LFs or SFR distributions. Our
results agree well with observations, but idealized models of quasar
lightcurves are ruled out by comparison of merger and quasar observations at

Under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central SMBH

different values, has been postulated as an explanation for the low non-zero
value observed for it in our Universe. It is often argued that our existence
pre-selects regions where the cosmological constant is sufficiently small to
allow galaxies like the Milky Way to form and intelligent life to emerge. Here
we propose a simple empirical test for this anthropic argument within the

galaxies formed in our Universe at redshifts as high as z~10 when the mean
matter density was larger by a factor of ~10^3 than today. Existing technology
enables to check whether planets form in nearby dwarf galaxies and globular
clusters by searching for microlensing or transit events of background stars.
The oldest of these nearby systems may have formed at z~10. If planets are as
common per stellar mass in these descendents as they are in the Milky Way
galaxy, then the anthropic argument would be weakened considerably since
planets could have formed in our Universe even if the cosmological constant was
three orders of magnitude larger than observed. For a flat probability
distribution, this would imply that the probability for us to reside in a

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605001v2,A Two-Zone Model for Type I X-ray Bursts on Accreting Neutron Stars,"  We construct a two-zone model to describe H and He burning on the surface of
an accreting neutron star and use it to study the triggering of type I X-ray
bursts. Although highly simplified, the model reproduces all of the bursting
regimes seen in the more complete global linear stability analysis of Narayan &
Heyl (2003), including the regime of delayed mixed bursts. The results are also
consistent with observations of type I X-ray bursts. At accretion rates Mdot <
0.1 Mdot_Edd, thermonuclear He burning via the well-known thin-shell thermal
instability triggers bursts. As Mdot increases, however, the trigger mechanism
evolves from the fast thermal instability to a slowly growing overstability
involving both H and He burning. The competition between nuclear heating via
the beta-limited CNO cycle and the triple-alpha process on the one hand, and
radiative cooling via photon diffusion and emission on the other hand, drives
oscillations with a period approximately equal to the H-burning timescale. If
these oscillations grow, the gradually rising temperature at the base of the
helium layer eventually provokes a thin-shell thermal instability and hence a
delayed mixed burst. For Mdot > 0.25 Mdot_Edd, there is no instability or
overstability, and there are no bursts. Nearly all other theoretical models
predict that bursts should occur for all Mdot < Mdot_Edd, in conflict with both
our results and observations. We suggest that this discrepancy arises from the
assumed strength of the hot CNO cycle breakout reaction 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne in
these other models. That observations agree much better with the results of
Narayan & Heyl and our two-zone model, both of which neglect breakout
reactions, may imply that the true 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne cross section is much
smaller than assumed in previous investigations.

the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of spectral
energy distribution (SED) shapes, and their dependence on luminosity, makes it
possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a
baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey.
We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z~4.5 and confirm
at high significance (>10sigma) previous claims of a flattening in both the
faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the

non-linear function, local in real space, of a Gaussian random field. We
compute the Cramer-Rao bound for f_NL and show that for small values of f_NL
the 3-point function estimator saturates the bound and is equivalent to
calculating the full Likelihood of the data. However, for sufficiently large
f_NL, the naive 3-point function estimator has a much larger variance than
previously thought. In the limit in which the departure from Gaussianity is
detected with high confidence, error bars on f_NL only decrease as 1/ln Npix
rather than Npix^-1/2 as the size of the data set increases. We identify the
physical origin of this behavior and explain why it only affects the local type
of non-Gaussianity, where the contribution of the first multipoles is always
relevant. We find a simple improvement to the 3-point function estimator that
makes the square root of its variance decrease as Npix^-1/2 even for large
f_NL, asymptotically approaching the Cramer-Rao bound. We show that using the
modified estimator is practically equivalent to computing the full Likelihood
of f_NL given the data. Thus other statistics of the data, such as the 4-point
function and Minkowski functionals, contain no additional information on f_NL.
In particular, we explicitly show that the recent claims about the relevance of
the 4-point function are not correct. By direct inspection of the Likelihood,
we show that the data do not contain enough information for any statistic to be
able to constrain higher order terms in the relation between the Gaussian field
and the curvature perturbation, unless these are orders of magnitude larger

processes in these sources, as a function of X-ray state and luminosity. A
global correlation is found between OIR and X-ray luminosity for low-mass black

proportional to Lx^0.6. This correlation holds over 8 orders of magnitude in Lx

some of the optical emission is suppressed below the correlation, a behaviour
indicative of the jet switching off/on in transition to/from the soft state. We
compare these relations to theoretical models of a number of emission

jets both predict a slope close to 0.6 for BHXBs, and both contribute to the
OIR in BHXBs in the hard state, the jets producing ~90 percent of the NIR
emission at high luminosities. X-ray reprocessing dominates the OIR in NSXBs in

  Progenitors of Short-Duration Hard-Spectrum Bursts","  Starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-duration
hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (SHB) by Swift last year, a growing body of
evidence has suggested that SHBs are associated with an older and
lower-redshift galactic population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases,
with large (>~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putative
host galaxies. Here we present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB
detected by Swift and localized by the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We find a massive
red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec from
our revised XRT position. Using associative and probabilistic arguments we
suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this
offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc in
projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any SHB to date and
almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset.
Spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host show
it to have undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB
060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the GRB explosion

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608190v2,Formation of z ~ 6 quasars from hierarchical galaxy mergers,"  The discovery of luminous quasars at redshift z ~ 6 indicates the presence of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of mass ~10^9 Msun when the Universe was less
than one billion years old. This finding presents several challenges for
theoretical models. Here, we present the first multi-scale simulations that,
together with a self-regulated model for the SMBH growth, produce a luminous
quasar at z ~ 6.5 in the LCDM paradigm. We follow the hierarchical assembly
history of the most massive halo in a ~ 3 Gpc^3 volume, and find that this halo
of ~ 8x 10^{12} Msun forming at z ~ 6.5 after several major mergers is able to
reproduce a number of observed properties of SDSS J1148+5251, the most distant
quasar detected at z =6.42 (Fan et al. 2003). Moreover, the SMBHs grow through
gas accretion below the Eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing to
feedback. We find that the progenitors experience significant star formation
(up to 10^4 Msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellar
mass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} Msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent with
observations of significant metal enrichment in SDSS J1148+5251. Our results
provide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard LCDM
cosmology, and demonstrate a common, merger-driven origin for the rarest
quasars and the fundamental SMBH-host correlation in a hierarchical
Universe.(Abridged)

have stacked flux in 70 and 160um Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer)
observations of the Canada-UK Deep Sub-millimeter Survey 14h field at the
positions of 850um sources detected by SCUBA and also 8 and 24um sources

strongest and the 8um sources the weakest contributors to the background flux
at both 70 and 160um. Our estimate of the contribution of the SCUBA sources is
higher than previous estimates. However, expressed as a total contribution, the
full 8um source catalogue accounts for twice the total 24um source contribution
and ~10 times the total SCUBA source contribution. The 8um sources account for
the majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16
MJy/sr and at least a third at 70um with a flux of 0.103+/-0.019 MJy/sr. These
measurements are consistent with current lower limits on the background at 70

over all redshifts, up to z~4. In contrast, the low-redshift half (z<1) of the
of 8um sample contributes approximately four times the total 70um flux of the

  Upcoming Observatories for Redshifted 21cm Radiation","  The question of whether intelligent life exists elsewhere is one of the
fundamental unknowns about our Universe. Over the past decade more than 200
extra-solar planets have been discovered, providing new urgency for addressing
this question in these or other planetary systems. Independently of this
perspective, new radio observatories for cosmology are currently being
constructed with the goal of detecting 21cm emission from cosmic hydrogen in
the redshift range 6<z<15. For example, the Low-Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) of
the Mileura Wide-Field Array (MWA), will cover in 8 kHz bins the entire
frequency range of 80-300 MHz, which is perfectly matched to the band over
which our civilization emits most of its radio power. We show that this and
other low-frequency observatories (culminating with the Square Kilometer Array
[SKA]) will be able to detect radio broadcast leakage from an Earth-like
civilization out to a distance of ~10^{1-2.7}pc, within a spherical volume
containing 10^{3-8}x(Omega_b/4*pi)^alpha stars, where alpha=1 (or 1.5) for a
radar beam of solid angle Omega_b that remains steady (or sweeps) across the
sky. Such a radio signal will show-up as a series of narrow spectral lines that
do not coincide with known atomic or molecular lines. The high spectral
resolution attainable with the upcoming observatories will allow to monitor the
periodic Doppler shift of the broadcasted lines over the planet's orbital
period around the parent star. Determination of the parent star mass through
observations of its spectrum could then be used to infer the inclination,
semi-major axis and eccentricity of the planet's orbit. This, in turn, will
allow to estimate the temperature on the planet's surface and to assess whether
it can support liquid water or life as we know it.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610817v1,Self-Similar Force-Free Wind From an Accretion Disk,"  We consider a self-similar force-free wind flowing out of an infinitely thin
disk located in the equatorial plane. On the disk plane, we assume that the
magnetic stream function $P$ scales as $P\propto R^\nu$, where $R$ is the
cylindrical radius. We also assume that the azimuthal velocity in the disk is
constant: $v_\phi = Mc$, where $M<1$ is a constant. For each choice of the
parameters $\nu$ and $M$, we find an infinite number of solutions that are
physically well-behaved and have fluid velocity $\leq c$ throughout the domain
of interest. Among these solutions, we show via physical arguments and
time-dependent numerical simulations that the minimum-torque solution, i.e.,
the solution with the smallest amount of toroidal field, is the one picked by a
real system. For $\nu \geq 1$, the Lorentz factor of the outflow increases
along a field line as $\gamma \approx M(z/\Rfp)^{(2-\nu)/2} \approx R/R_{\rm
A}$, where $\Rfp$ is the radius of the foot-point of the field line on the disk
and $R_{\rm A}=\Rfp/M$ is the cylindrical radius at which the field line
crosses the Alfven surface or the light cylinder. For $\nu < 1$, the Lorentz
factor follows the same scaling for $z/\Rfp < M^{-1/(1-\nu)}$, but at larger
distances it grows more slowly: $\gamma \approx (z/\Rfp)^{\nu/2}$. For either
regime of $\nu$, the dependence of $\gamma$ on $M$ shows that the rotation of
the disk plays a strong role in jet acceleration. On the other hand, the
poloidal shape of a field line is given by $z/\Rfp \approx
(R/\Rfp)^{2/(2-\nu)}$ and is independent of $M$. Thus rotation has neither a
collimating nor a decollimating effect on field lines, suggesting that
relativistic astrophysical jets are not collimated by the rotational winding up
of the magnetic field.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612021v2,Rapid N_H changes in NGC 4151,"  We have analyzed the two longest (elapsed time > 3 days) BeppoSAX
observations of the X-ray brightest Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4151, to search for
spectral variability on time-scales from a few tens of ksec to years. We found
in both cases highly significant spectral variability below ~ 6 keV down to the
shortest time-scales investigated. These variations can be naturally explained
in terms of variations in the low energy cut-off due to obscuring matter along
the line of sight. If the cut-off is modeled by two neutral absorption
components, one fully covering the source and the second covering only a
fraction of the source, the shortest time-scale of variability of a few days
constrains the location of the obscuring matter to within 3.4 X 10^4
Schwarzschild radii from the central X-ray source. This is consistent with the
distance of the Broad Emission Line Region, as inferred from reverberation
mapping, and difficult to reconcile with the parsec scale dusty molecular torus
of Krolik & Begelman (1988). We have also explored a more complex absorption
structure, namely the presence of an ionized absorber. Although the behaviour
of the ionization parameter is nicely consistent with the expectations, the
results are not completely satisfactory from the statistical point of view.
  The overall absorption during the 2001 December observation is lower than in
all other historical observations with similar 2-10 keV flux. This suggests
that absorption variability plays a crucial role in the observed flux
variability of this source.

  Galaxies During the Reionization Era","  [Abridged] We develop a simple star formation model whose goal is to
interpret the emerging body of observational data on star-forming galaxies at
z>~6. The efficiency and duty cycle of the star formation activity within dark
matter halos are determined by fitting the luminosity functions of Lya emitter
and Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~5-6. Using our model parameters we
predict the likely abundance of star forming galaxies at earlier epochs and
compare these to the emerging data in the redshift interval 7<z<10. We find
that the abundance of luminous Lyman-break galaxies in the 500 Myr between z~6
and 10 can be naturally explained by the hierarchical assembly of dark matter
haloes; there is only marginal evidence for strong physical evolution. In
contrast, the first estimates of the abundance of less luminous star forming
galaxies at z=9-10 are higher than predicted and, if verified by further data,
may suggest a top-heavy stellar mass function at these early epochs. Although
these abundances remain uncertain because of the difficulty of spectroscopic
confirmation and cosmic variance, even a modest improvement in survey
capability with present or upcoming facilities should yield great progress. In
this context, we use our model to consider those observational techniques that
hold the most promise and make predictions for specific surveys that are, or
will soon be, underway. We conclude that narrowband Lya emitter surveys should
be efficient on searches at z~7-8; however, such conventional surveys are
unlikely to detect sufficient galaxies at z~10 to provide useful constraints.
For this reason, gravitational lensing offers the best prospect for probing the
z~10 universe prior to JWST.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702002v2,Cuscuton Cosmology: Dark Energy meets Modified Gravity,"  In a companion paper (hep-th/0609150), we have introduced a model of scalar
field dark energy, Cuscuton, which can be realized as the incompressible (or
infinite speed of sound) limit of a k-essence fluid. In this paper, we study
how Cuscuton modifies the constraint sector of Einstein gravity. In particular,
we study Cuscuton cosmology and show that even though Cuscuton can have an
arbitrary equation of state, or time dependence, and is thus inhomogeneous; its
perturbations do not introduce any additional dynamical degree of freedom and
only satisfy a constraint equation, amounting to an effective modification of
gravity on large scales. Therefore, Cuscuton can be considered to be a minimal
theory of evolving dark energy, or a minimal modification of a cosmological
constant, as it has no internal dynamics. Moreover, this is the only
modification of Einstein gravity to our knowledge that does not introduce any
additional degrees freedom (and is not conformally equivalent to the Einstein
gravity). We then study two simple Cuscuton models, with quadratic and
exponential potentials. The quadratic model has the exact same expansion
history as LCDM, and yet contains an early dark energy component with constant
energy fraction, which is constrained to < 2%, mainly from WMAP Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and SDSS Lyman-alpha forest observations. The
exponential model has the same expansion history as the DGP self-accelerating
braneworld model, but generates a much smaller Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect, and is thus consistent with the CMB observations. Finally, we show that
the evolution is local on super-horizon scales, implying that there is no gross
violation of causality, despite Cuscuton's infinite speed of sound.

nearby relaxed clusters. To assess the impact of galaxy formation, we compare
two sets of simulations, one performed in the non-radiative regime and another
with radiative cooling and several physical processes critical to various
aspects of galaxy formation: star formation, metal enrichment and stellar
feedback. We show that the observed ICM properties outside cluster cores are
well-reproduced in the simulations that include cooling and star formation,
while the non-radiative simulations predict an overall shape of the ICM
profiles inconsistent with observations. In particular, we find that the ICM
entropy in our runs with cooling is enhanced to the observed levels at radii as
large as half of the virial radius. We also find that outside cluster cores
entropy scaling with the mean ICM temperature in both simulations and Chandra
observations is consistent with being self-similar within current error bars.
We find that the pressure profiles of simulated clusters are also close to
self-similar and exhibit little cluster-to-cluster scatter. The X-ray
observable-total mass relations for our simulated sample agree with the Chandra
measurements to \~10%-20% in normalization. We show that this systematic
difference could be caused by the subsonic gas motions, unaccounted for in
X-ray hydrostatic mass estimates. The much improved agreement of simulations
and observations in the ICM profiles and scaling relations is encouraging and
the existence of tight relations of X-ray observables, such as Yx, and total
cluster mass and the simple redshift evolution of these relations hold promise
for the use of clusters as cosmological probes.

Serpens and Ophiuchus. Color excess ratios E(H-Ks)/E(Ks-[lambda]) were measured

disks/envelopes.
  For four of these five regions, the extinction laws are similar at all
wavelengths and differ systematically from a previous determination of the

bands. This difference could be due to the difference in the dust properties of
the dense molecular clouds observed here and those of the diffuse ISM. The

that to the other four regions studied here and that for the ISM. In addition,
we extended our extinction law determination to 24micron for Serpens and NGC

which make absolute comparison uncertain. However, our work confirms a

improvement over existing models in describing local bonding for bulk defects
and disordered phases. The model consists of two- and three-body interactions
with theoretically motivated functional forms that capture chemical and
physical trends as explained in a companion paper. The numerical parameters in
the functional form are obtained by fitting to a set of ab initio results from
quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory in the local
density approximation, which include various bulk phases and defect structures.
We test the potential by applying it to the relaxation of point defects, core
properties of partial dislocations and the structure of disordered phases, none
of which are included in the fitting procedure. For dislocations, our model
makes predictions in excellent agreement with ab initio and tight-binding
calculations. It is the only potential known to describe both the 30$^\circ$-
and 90$^\circ$-partial dislocations in the glide set {111}. The structural and
thermodynamic properties of the liquid and amorphous phases are also in good
agreement with experimental and ab initio results. Our potential is the first
capable of simulating a quench directly from the liquid to the amorphous phase,
and the resulting amorphous structure is more realistic than with existing
empirical preparation methods. These advances in transferability come with no
extra computational cost, since force evaluation with our model is faster than
with the popular potential of Stillinger-Weber, thus allowing reliable
atomistic simulations of very large atomic systems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0010183v1,Glassy effects in the swelling/collapse dynamics of homogeneous polymers,"  We investigate, using numerical simulations and analytical arguments, a
simple one dimensional model for the swelling or the collapse of a closed
polymer chain of size N, representing the dynamical evolution of a polymer in a
\Theta-solvent that is rapidly changed into a good solvent (swelling) or a bad
solvent (collapse). In the case of swelling, the density profile for
intermediate times is parabolic and expands in space as t^{1/3}, as predicted
by a Flory-like continuum theory. The dynamics slows down after a time \propto
N^2 when the chain becomes stretched, and the polymer gets stuck in metastable
`zig-zag' configurations, from which it escapes through thermal activation. The
size of the polymer in the final stages is found to grow as \sqrt{\ln t}. In
the case of collapse, the chain very quickly (after a time of order unity)
breaks up into clusters of monomers (`pearls'). The evolution of the chain then
proceeds through a slow growth of the size of these metastable clusters, again
evolving as the logarithm of time. We enumerate the total number of metastable
states as a function of the extension of the chain, and deduce from this
computation that the radius of the chain should decrease as 1/\ln(\ln t). We
compute the total number of metastable states with a given value of the energy,
and find that the complexity is non zero for arbitrary low energies. We also
obtain the distribution of cluster sizes, that we compare to simple
`cut-in-two' coalescence models. Finally, we determine the aging properties of
the dynamical structure. The subaging behaviour that we find is attributed to
the tail of the distribution at small cluster sizes, corresponding to
anomalously `fast' clusters (as compared to the average). We argue that this
mechanism for subaging might hold in other slowly coarsening systems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0011168v1,"Characterization of the frequency of extreme events by the Generalized
  Pareto Distribution","  Based on recent results in extreme value theory, we use a new technique for
the statistical estimation of distribution tails. Specifically, we use the
Gnedenko-Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem, which gives a natural limit law for
peak-over-threshold values in the form of the Generalized Pareto Distribution
(GPD). Useful in finance, insurance, hydrology, we investigate here the
earthquake energy distribution described by the Gutenberg-Richter seismic
moment-frequency law and analyze shallow earthquakes (depth h < 70 km) in the
Harvard catalog over the period 1977-2000 in 18 seismic zones. The whole GPD is
found to approximate the tails of the seismic moment distributions quite well
above moment-magnitudes larger than mW=5.3 and no statistically significant
regional difference is found for subduction and transform seismic zones. We
confirm that the b-value is very different in mid-ocean ridges compared to
other zones (b=1.50=B10.09 versus b=1.00=B10.05 corresponding to a power law
exponent close to 1 versus 2/3) with a very high statistical confidence. We
propose a physical mechanism for this, contrasting slow healing ruptures in
mid-ocean ridges with fast healing ruptures in other zones. Deviations from the
GPD at the very end of the tail are detected in the sample containing
earthquakes from all major subduction zones (sample size of 4985 events). We
propose a new statistical test of significance of such deviations based on the
bootstrap method. The number of events deviating from the tails of GPD in the
studied data sets (15-20 at most) is not sufficient for determining the
functional form of those deviations. Thus, it is practically impossible to give
preference to one of the previously suggested parametric families describing
the ends of tails of seismic moment distributions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9901025v14,On the Topological Nature of Fundamental Interactions,"  A thought experiment is proposed to unify quantum mechanics and general
relativity. The central paradigm is that space-time {\it topology} is
ultimately responsible for the Heisenberg uncertaintly principle. It is found
that Plankian space-time exhibits a complicated, but also definite, multiply
connected character. In this framework, an analysis of the interactions in
Nature is presented.
  I. The Universal ground state of the constructed theory derives from the
properties of the topological manifold $Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$, which has
23 intrinsic degrees of freedom, discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal
groups, an SU(5) gauge group, and leads to a U(1) symmetry on a lattice. The
structure of $Q$ provides a unique equation motion for the mass-energy and
particle rest mass wave functions. In its excited state the Universe is
characterized by a lattice of three-tori, $L(T^3)$. The topological
identifications present in this structure, a direct reflection of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, provide the boundary conditions for solutions
to the equation of motion, and suggest an interpretation for the conceptually
difficult concept of quantum mechanical entanglement. II. In the second half of
the paper the (observable) properties of $Q$ and $L(T^3)$ are investigated. One
reproduces the standard model, and the theory naturally contains a Higgs field
with possible inflation. The electron and its neutrino are identified as
particle ground states and their masses, together with those of all other known
particles, are predicted. A mass of $m_{\rm H}=131.6$ GeV is found for the
Higgs boson. [Abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9901319v4,Metric preheating and limitations of linearized gravity,"  Recently it has become clear that the resonant amplification of quantum field
fluctuations at preheating must be accompanied by resonant amplification of
scalar metric perturbations, since the two are united by Einstein's equations.
Furthermore, this ""metric preheating"" enhances particle production and leads to
gravitational rescattering effects even at linear order. In multi-field models
with strong preheating (q \gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear,
with the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \to 0).
This amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the
inflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy
perturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein
field equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial
conditions. This has serious implications at all scales - from the large-angle
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies to primordial black holes. We
investigate the (q,k) parameter space in a two-field model, and introduce the
time to nonlinearity, t_{nl}, as the timescale for the breakdown of the
linearized Einstein equations. Backreaction effects are expected to shut down
the linear resonances, but cannot remove the existing amplification, which
threatens the viability of strong preheating when confronted with the CMB. We
discuss ways to escape the above conclusions, including secondary phases of
inflation and preheating solely to fermions. Finally we rank known classes of
inflation from strongest (chaotic and strongly coupled hybrid inflation) to
weakest (hidden sector, warm inflation) in terms of the distortion of the
primordial spectrum due to these resonances in preheating.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0405243v3,"Little Hierarchy, Little Higgses, and a Little Symmetry","  Little Higgs theories are an attempt to address the little hierarchy problem,
i.e., the tension between the naturalness of the electroweak scale and the
precision measurements showing no evidence for new physics up to 5-10 TeV. In
little Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop
order from the quadratic divergence. This allows the cutoff to be raised up to
\~10 TeV, beyond the scales probed by the precision data. However, strong
constraints can still arise from the contributions of the new TeV scale
particles and hence re-introduces the fine-tuning problem. In this paper we
show that a new symmetry, denoted as T-parity, under which all heavy gauge
bosons and scalar triplets are odd, can remove all the tree-level contributions
to the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little Higgs theories
completely natural. The T-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of
little Higgs models by following the most general construction of the low
energy effective theory a la Callan, Coleman, Wess and Zumino. In particular,
we discuss in detail how to implement the T-parity in the littlest Higgs model
based on SU(5)/SO(5). The symmetry breaking scale f can be even lower than 500
GeV if the contributions from the unknown UV physics at the cutoff are somewhat
small. The existence of $T$-parity has drastic impacts on the phenomenology of
the little Higgs theories. The T-odd particles need to be pair-produced and
will cascade down to the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) which is stable. A
neutral LTP gives rise to missing energy signals at the colliders which can
mimic supersymmetry. It can also serve as a good dark matter candidate.

http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0103018v4,Effect of Trends on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis,"  Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis method used to
estimate long-range power-law correlation exponents in noisy signals. Many
noisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results
obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically
study the effects of three types of trends -- linear, periodic, and power-law
trends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data.
We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially
generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how
trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find
that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise
and the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of
these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the
amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of
the power-law trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties
of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy
signals with trends also follow scaling laws -- i.e. long-range power-law
dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We
show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the
superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend,
assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition
rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superimposed
trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in
the correlation properties of the noise.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2416v2,Fundamental Plane of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters,"  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys are considered among the most
promising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their
premise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be
affected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In
this letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that
accommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane
relationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy
clusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is
the mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ
half-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using
the Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in
mass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since
measurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ
clusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of
the cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting
cosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our
Fundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one
may naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while
including more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve
the accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of
non-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the
intracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to
reduce these errors.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3465v1,"Cosmological Simulations of the Preheating Scenario for Galaxy Cluster
  Formation: Comparison to Analytic Models and Observations","  We perform a set of non--radiative cosmological simulations of a preheated
intracluster medium in which the entropy of the gas was uniformly boosted at
high redshift. The results of these simulations are used first to test the
current analytic techniques of preheating via entropy input in the smooth
accretion limit. When the unmodified profile is taken directly from
simulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the results
of our simulations. This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the
accreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good
approximation even with a realistic accretion history. When we examine the
simulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropy
amplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. In
the second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheating
simulations to recent observations. We show -- in agreement with previous work
-- that for a reasonable amount of preheating, a satisfactory match can be
found to the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. However --
as noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of the
simulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. In particular,
while rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at large
radius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating can
simultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels. As a result,
we confirm that the simple preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, in
which entropy is injected universally at high redshift, is inconsistent with
observations.

high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise quasar spectra obtained with the ESI and

represents an improvement over previous analyses of the Lya forest from
high-resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of two in the
size of the data set alone. We pay particular attention to robust error
estimation and extensively test for systematic effects. We find that our
estimates of the quasar continuum levels in the Lya forest obtained by spline
fitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the bias
increasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mock
spectra. The mean fractional error is <1% at z=2, 4% at z=3, and 12% at z=4.
Previous measurements of tau_eff at z>~3 based on directly fitting the quasar
continua in the Lya forest, which have generally neglected this effect, are
therefore likely biased low. We provide estimates of the level of absorption

the young Galactic stellar population that was included in our survey. We find
that easily-detectable magnetars, modeled after persistent anomalous X-ray
pulsars, could have been identified in 5% of the Galactic spiral arms by mass.
If we assume there are 3 previously-known examples within our random survey,
then there are 59 (+92,-32) in the Galaxy. Transient magnetars in quiescence
could have been identified throughout 0.4% of the spiral arms, and the lack of
new examples implies that <540 exist in the Galaxy (90% confidence). Similar

in outburst by current and past X-ray missions. For assumed lifetimes of 1e4

http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2669v3,"A Radio Through X-ray Study of the Jet/Companion-Galaxy Interaction in
  3C 321","  We present a multiwavelength study of the nucleus, environment, jets, and
hotspots of the nearby FRII radio galaxy 3C 321, using new and archival data
from MERLIN, the VLA, Spitzer, HST, and Chandra. An initially collimated radio
jet extends northwest from the nucleus of its host galaxy and produces a
compact knot of radio emission adjacent (in projection) to a companion galaxy,
after which it dramatically flares and bends, extending out in a diffuse
structure 35 kpc northwest of the nucleus. We argue that the simplest
explanation for the unusual morphology of the jet is that it is undergoing an
interaction with the companion galaxy. Given that the northwest hotspot that
lies >250 kpc from the core shows X-ray emission, which likely indicates in
situ high-energy particle acceleration, we argue that the jet-companion
interaction is not a steady-state situation. Instead, we suggest that the jet
has been disrupted on a timescale less than the light travel time to the end of
the lobe, $\sim 10^6$ years, and that the jet flow to this hotspot will only be
disrupted for as long as the jet-companion interaction takes place. The host
galaxy of 3C 321 and the companion galaxy are in the process of merging, and
each hosts a luminous AGN. As this is an unusual situation, we investigate the
hypothesis that the interacting jet has driven material on to the companion
galaxy, triggering its AGN. Finally, we present detailed radio and X-ray
observations of both hotspots, which show that there are multiple emission
sites, with spatial offsets between the radio and X-ray emission.

  Redshift z ~ 2","  Observations with Spitzer Space Telescope have recently revealed a
significant population of high-redshift z~2 dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with
large mid-IR to UV luminosity ratios. These galaxies have been missed in
traditional optical studies of the distant universe. We present a simple method
for selecting this high-z population based solely on the ratio of the observed
mid-IR 24um to optical R-band flux density. In the 8.6 sq.deg Bootes NDWFS
Field, we uncover ~2,600 DOG candidates (= 0.089/sq.arcmin) with 24um flux
densities F24>0.3mJy and (R-[24])>14 (i.e., F[24]/F[R] > 1000). These galaxies
have no counterparts in the local universe, and become a larger fraction of the
population at fainter F24, representing 13% of the sources at 0.3~mJy. DOGs
exhibit evidence of both star-formation and AGN activity, with the brighter
24um sources being more AGN- dominated. We have measured spectroscopic
redshifts for 86 DOGs, and find a broad z distribution centered at <z>~2.0.
Their space density is 2.82E-5 per cubic Mpc, similar to that of bright
sub-mm-selected galaxies at z~2. These redshifts imply very large luminosities
LIR>~1E12-14 Lsun. DOGs contribute ~45-100% of the IR luminosity density
contributed by all z~2 ULIRGs, suggesting that our simple selection criterion
identifies the bulk of z~2 ULIRGs. DOGs may be the progenitors of ~4L*
present-day galaxies seen undergoing a luminous,short- lived phase of bulge and
black hole growth. They may represent a brief evolution phase between SMGs and
less obscured quasars or galaxies. [Abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2186v3,"Extrasolar planet detection by binary stellar eclipse timing: evidence
  for a third body around CM Draconis","  Context: New eclipse minimum timings of the M4.5/M4.5 binary CM Dra were
obtained between the years 2000 and 2007. In combination with published timings
going back to 1977, a clear non-linearity in observed-minus-calculated (O-C)
times has become apparent. Several models are applied to explain the observed
timing behavior.
  Aims: Revealing the processes that cause the observed O-C behavior, and
testing the evidence for a third body around the CM Dra system.
  Methods: The O-C times of the system were fitted against several functions,
representing different physical origins of the timing variations.
  Results: An analysis using model-selection statistics gives about equal
weight to a parabolic and to a sinusoidal fitting function. Attraction from a
third body, either at large distance in a quasi-constant constellation across
the years of observations or from a body on a shorter orbit generating
periodicities in O-C times is the most likely source of the observed O-C times.
The white dwarf GJ 630.1B, a proper motion companion of CM Dra, can however be
rejected as the responsible third body. Also, no further evidence of the
short-periodic planet candidate described by Deeg et al. (2000) is found,
whereas other mechanisms, such as period changes from stellar winds or
Applegate's mechanism can be rejected.
  Conclusions: A third body, being either a few-Jupiter-mass object with a
period of 18.5+-4.5 years or an object in the mass range of 1.5M_jup to
0.1M_sun with periods of hundreds to thousands of years is the most likely
origin of the observed minimum timing behavior.

  SPH Simulations","  We study the properties of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) at z=3-6 using cosmological SPH simulations. We investigate two
simple scenarios for explaining the observed Ly-a and rest-frame UV luminosity
functions (LFs) of LAEs: (i) the ""escape fraction"" scenario, in which the
""effective"" escape fraction (including the IGM attenuation) of Ly-a photons is
f_Lya ~0.1 (0.15) at z=3 (6), and (ii) the ""stochastic"" scenario, in which the
fraction of LAEs that are turned on at z=3 (6) is \Cstoc ~0.07 (0.2) after
correcting for the IGM attenuation. Our comparisons with a number of different
observations suggest that the stochastic scenario is preferred over the escape
fraction scenario. We find that the mean values of stellar mass, metallicity
and black hole mass hosted by LAEs are all smaller in the stochastic scenario
than in the escape fraction scenario. In our simulations, the galaxy stellar
mass function evolves rapidly, as expected in hierarchical structure formation.
However, its evolution is largely compensated by a beginning decline in the
specific star formation rate, resulting in little evolution of the rest-frame
UV LF from z=6 to 3. The rest-frame UV LF of both LAEs and LBGs at z=3 & 6 can
be described well by the stochastic scenario provided the extinction is
moderate, E(B-V) ~0.15, for both populations, although our simulation might be
overpredicting the number of bright LBGs at z=6. We also discuss the
correlation function and bias of LAEs. The Ly-a LFs at z=6 in a field-of-view
of 0.2 deg^2 show a significantly larger scatter owing to cosmic variance
relative to that in a 1 deg^2 field, and the scatter seen in the current

http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2944v1,Structural Analysis of Molecular Clouds: Dendrograms,"  We demonstrate the utility of dendrograms at representing the essential
features of the hierarchical structure of the isosurfaces for molecular line
data cubes. The dendrogram of a data cube is an abstraction of the changing
topology of the isosurfaces as a function of contour level. The ability to
track hierarchical structure over a range of scales makes this analysis
philosophically different from local segmentation algorithms like CLUMPFIND.
Points in the dendrogram structure correspond to specific volumes in data cubes
defined by their bounding isosurfaces. We further refine the technique by
measuring the properties associated with each isosurface in the analysis
allowing for a multiscale calculation of molecular gas properties. Using
COMPLETE 13CO(1-0) data from the L1448 region in Perseus and mock observations
of a simulated data cube, we identify regions that have a significant
contribution by self-gravity to their energetics on a range of scales. We find
evidence for self-gravitation on all spatial scales in L1448 though not in all
regions. In the simulated observations, nearly all of the emission is found in
objects that would be self-gravitating if gravity were included in the
simulation. We reconstruct the size-line width relationship within the data
cube using the dendrogram-derived properties and find it follows the standard
relation: s_v ~ R^0.58. Finally, we show that constructing the dendrogram of CO
J=1-0 emission from the Orion-Monoceros region allows for the identification of
giant molecular clouds in a blended molecular line data set using only a
physically motivated definition (self-gravitating clouds with masses 5x10^4

  Burst Engines","  Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) require an engine capable of driving a
jet of plasma to ultrarelativistic bulk Lorentz factors of up to several
hundred and into narrow opening angles of a few degrees. We use global
axisymmetric stationary solutions of magnetically-dominated (force-free)
ultrarelativistic jets to test whether the popular magnetic-driving paradigm
can generate the required Lorentz factors and opening angles. Our global
solutions are obtained via time-dependent relativistic ideal magnetodynamical
numerical simulations which follow the jet from the central engine to beyond
six orders of magnitude in radius. Our model is primarily motivated by the
collapsar model, in which a jet is produced by a spinning black hole or neutron
star and then propagates through a massive stellar envelope. We find that the
size of the presupernova progenitor star and the radial profile of pressure
inside the star determine the terminal Lorentz factor and opening angle of the
jet. At the radius where the jet breaks out of the star, our well-motivated
fiducial model generates a Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 400$ and a half-opening
angle $\theta_j\sim 2^\circ$, consistent with observations of many
long-duration GRBs. Other models with slightly different parameters give
$\gamma$ in the range 100 to 5000 and $\theta_j$ from $0.1^\circ$ to
$10^\circ$, thus reproducing the range of properties inferred for GRB jets. A
potentially observable feature of some of our solutions is that the maximum
Poynting flux in the jet is found at $\theta \sim \theta_j$ with the jet power
concentrated in a hollow cone, while the maximum in the Lorentz factor occurs
at an angle $\theta$ substantially smaller than $\theta_j$ also in a hollow
cone. [abridged]

simulation of the Lambda CDM cosmology. At the redshift we concentrate on, z=1,
the spatial resolution is 1.4 proper kpc/h and Milky-way sized disk galaxies
contain ~10^5 particles within their virial radii. We include supermassive
black hole accretion and feedback as well as a multiphase model for star
formation. We find that a number of familiar qualitative relationships hold
approximately between galaxy properties, for example, galaxies lie between two
broad extremes of type, where ``late'' types tend to be smaller in size, have
lower circular velocities, younger stars, higher star formation rates, larger
disk to bulge ratios and lower Sersic indices than ``early types''. As in
previous studies the stellar component of disk galaxies is not as rotationally
supported as in observations. Bulges contain too much of the stellar mass,
although disks do have scale lengths compatible with observations. The addition
of black hole physics to the simulations does not appear to have an impact on
the angular momentum results, nor do we find that it is affected in an
identical simulation with significantly lower mass resolution. Despite this, we
can profitably use the rank order of either disk to total ratio, Sersic index,
or galaxy age to separate galaxies into morphological classes and examine the
density-morphology relation and morphology dependence of clustering. We find
that while at redshift z=0, the well known preponderance of early types in
dense environments is seen, at z=1 the density-morphology relation becomes
flatter and late type galaxies are even seen to have a higher clustering
amplitude than early types (abridged).

V-band images of Pluto on 32 plates taken on 15 nights from 19 March 1933 to 10
March 1934. Most of these plates were taken with the Mount Wilson 60"" and 100""
telescopes, but 7 of the plates (now at the Harvard College Observatory) were
taken with the 12"" and 16"" Metcalf doublets at Oak Ridge. The plates were
measured with an iris diaphragm photometer, which has an average one-sigma
photometric error on these plates of 0.08 mag as measured by the repeatability
of constant comparison stars. The modern B and V magnitudes for the comparison
stars were measured with the Lowell Observatory Hall 1.1-m telescope. The
magnitudes in the plate's photographic system were converted to the Johnson B-
and V-system after correction with color terms, even though they are small in
size. We find that the average B-band mean opposition magnitude of Pluto in
1933-1934 was 15.73 +- 0.01, and we see a roughly sinusoidal modulation on the
rotational period (6.38 days) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.11 +- 0.03
mag. With this, we show that Pluto darkened by 5% from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955.
This darkening from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955 cannot be due to changing viewing
geometry (as both epochs had identical sub-Earth latitudes), so our
observations must record a real albedo change over the southern hemisphere. The
later darkening trend from 1954 to the 1980s has been explained by changing
viewing geometry (as more of the darker northern hemisphere comes into view).
Thus, we now have strong evidence for albedo changes on the surface of Pluto,
and these are most easily explained by the systematic sublimation of frosts
from the sunward pole that led to a drop in the mean surface albedo.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3032v1,Testing earthquake predictions,"  Statistical tests of earthquake predictions require a null hypothesis to
model occasional chance successes. To define and quantify `chance success' is
knotty. Some null hypotheses ascribe chance to the Earth: Seismicity is modeled
as random. The null distribution of the number of successful predictions -- or
any other test statistic -- is taken to be its distribution when the fixed set
of predictions is applied to random seismicity. Such tests tacitly assume that
the predictions do not depend on the observed seismicity. Conditioning on the
predictions in this way sets a low hurdle for statistical significance.
Consider this scheme: When an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater occurs
anywhere in the world, predict that an earthquake at least as large will occur
within 21 days and within an epicentral distance of 50 km. We apply this rule
to the Harvard centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) catalog for 2000--2004 to generate
a set of predictions. The null hypothesis is that earthquake times are
exchangeable conditional on their magnitudes and locations and on the
predictions--a common ``nonparametric'' assumption in the literature. We
generate random seismicity by permuting the times of events in the CMT catalog.
We consider an event successfully predicted only if (i) it is predicted and
(ii) there is no larger event within 50 km in the previous 21 days. The
$P$-value for the observed success rate is $<0.001$: The method successfully
predicts about 5% of earthquakes, far better than `chance,' because the
predictor exploits the clustering of earthquakes -- occasional foreshocks --
which the null hypothesis lacks. Rather than condition on the predictions and
use a stochastic model for seismicity, it is preferable to treat the observed
seismicity as fixed, and to compare the success rate of the predictions to the
success rate of simple-minded predictions like those just described. If the
proffered predictions do no better than a simple scheme, they have little
value.

Hipparcos and FK5 proper motions by Wielen et al., we find a mass for Polaris
Aa of 4.5^{+2.2}_{-1.4} M_\odot--the first purely dynamical mass determined for
any Cepheid. For the faint companion Polaris Ab we find a dynamical mass of
1.26^{+0.14}_{-0.07} M_\odot, consistent with an inferred spectral type of F6 V

difference at the V band is estimated to be 7.2 mag. Continued HST observations
will significantly reduce the mass errors, which are presently still too large

loss, rotation, and opacities in the evolution of intermediate-mass stars.
  Our astrometry, combined with two centuries of archival measurements, also
confirms that the well-known, more distant (18"") visual companion, Polaris B,

consistent with orbital motion in a long-period bound system. The ultraviolet

infrared quasars (IR QSOs) in the local universe based on the spectra from the
Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The MIR properties
of IR QSOs are compared with those of optically-selected Palomar-Green QSOs (PG
QSOs) and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The average MIR spectral
features from ~ 5 to 30um, including the spectral slopes, 6.2um PAH emission
strengths and [NeII] 12.81um luminosities of IR QSOs, differ from those of PG
QSOs. In contrast, IR QSOs and ULIRGs have comparable PAH and [NeII]
luminosities. These results are consistent with IR QSOs being at a transitional
stage from ULIRGs to classical QSOs. We also find that the colour index
alpha(30, 15) is a good indicator of the relative contribution of starbursts to
AGNs for all QSOs. Correlations between the [NeII] 12.81um and PAH 6.2um
luminosities and those between the [NeII], PAH with 60um luminosities for
ULIRGs and IR QSOs indicate that both [NeII] and PAH luminosities are
approximate star formation rate indicators for IR QSOs and starburst-dominated
galaxies; the scatters are, however, quite large (~ 0.7 to 0.8 dex). Finally
the correlation between the EW(PAH 6.2um) and outflow velocities suggests that
star formation activities are suppressed by feedback from AGNs and/or
supernovae.

  Background, Cosmic Star Formation, and Quasar Activity","  We investigate the implications of the intergalactic opacity for the
evolution of the cosmic UV luminosity density and its sources. Our main
constraint is our measurement of the Lya forest opacity at redshifts 2<z<4.2
from 86 high-resolution quasar spectra. In addition, we impose the requirements
that HI must be reionized by z=6 and HeII by z~3, and consider estimates of the
hardness of the ionizing background from HI to HeII column density ratios. The
derived hydrogen photoionization rate is remarkably flat over the Lya forest
redshift range covered. Because the quasar luminosity function is strongly
peaked near z~2, the lack of redshift evolution indicates that star-forming
galaxies likely dominate the photoionization rate at z>~3. Combined with direct
measurements of the galaxy UV luminosity function, this requires only a small
fraction f_esc~0.5% of galactic hydrogen ionizing photons to escape their
source for galaxies to solely account for the entire ionizing background. Under
the assumption that the galactic UV emissivity traces the star formation rate,
current state-of-the-art observational estimates of the star formation rate
density appear to underestimate the total photoionization rate at z~4 by a
factor ~4, are in tension with recent determinations of the UV luminosity
function, and fail to reionize the Universe by z~6 if extrapolated to
arbitrarily high redshift. A theoretical star formation history peaking earlier
fits the Lya forest photoionization rate well, reionizes the Universe in time,
and is in better agreement with the rate of z~4 gamma-ray bursts observed by
Swift. Quasars suffice to doubly ionize helium by z~3 and likely contribute a
non-negligible and perhaps dominant fraction of the hydrogen ionizing
background at their z~2 peak. [Abridged]

galaxies 3C 305, DA 240, and 4C 73.08, and investigate the origin of their
nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclei of the three sources appear to have
different relative contributions of accretion- and jet-related X-ray emission,
as expected based on earlier work. The X-ray spectrum of the FRII narrow-line
radio galaxy (NLRG) 4C 73.08 is modeled with the sum of a heavily absorbed
power law that we interpret to be associated with a luminous accretion disk and
circumnuclear obscuring structure, and an unabsorbed power law that originates
in an unresolved jet. This behavior is consistent with other narrow-line radio
galaxies. The X-ray emission of the low-excitation FRII radio galaxy DA 240 is
best modeled as an unabsorbed power law that we associate with a parsec-scale
jet, similar to other low-excitation sources that we have studied previously.
However, the X-ray nucleus of the narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 305 shows no
evidence for the heavily absorbed X-ray emission that has been found in other
NLRGs. It is possible that the nuclear optical spectrum in 3C 305 is
intrinsically weak-lined, with the strong emission arising from extended
regions that indicate the presence of jet--environment interactions. Our
observations of 3C 305 suggest that this source is more closely related to
other weak-lined radio galaxies. This ambiguity could extend to other sources
currently classified as NLRGs. We also present XMM-Newton and VLA observations
of the hotspot of DA 240, arguing that this is another detection of X-ray
synchrotron emission from a low-luminosity hotspot.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2988v1,Extending Recovery of the Primordial Matter Power Spectrum,"  The shape of the primordial matter power spectrum Plin(k) encodes critical
information on cosmological parameters. At large scales, the observable galaxy
power spectrum Pobs(k) is expected to follow the shape of Plin(k), but on
smaller scales the effects of nonlinearity and galaxy bias make the ratio
Pobs(k)/Plin(k) scale-dependent. We develop a method that can extend the
dynamic range of the Plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on the
galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) from the projected galaxy correlation
function wp. We devise an analytic model to calculate Pobs(k) in real-space and
redshift-space. Once HOD parameters are determined by matching wp for a given
cosmological model, galaxy bias is completely specified, and our analytic model
predicts both the shape and normalization of Pobs(k). Applying our method to
SDSS main galaxy samples, we find that the real-space Pobs(k) follows the shape
of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the 1-2% level up to k=0.2 h/Mpc.
When we apply our method to SDSS LRG samples, the linear bias approximation is
accurate to 5% at k<0.08 h/Mpc, but the scale-dependence of LRG bias prevents
the use of linear theory at k>0.08 h/Mpc. Our HOD model prediction is in good
agreement with the recent SDSS LRG Pobs(k) measurements at all measured scales
(k<0.2 h/Mpc), naturally explaining the shape of Pobs(k). The ""Q-model""
prescription is a poor description of galaxy bias for the LRG samples, and it
can lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates when measurements at k>0.1
h/Mpc are included in the analysis. We quantify the potential bias and
constraints on cosmological parameters that arise from applying linear theory
and Q-model fitting, and we demonstrate the utility of HOD modeling of future
high precision measurements of Pobs(k) on quasi-linear scales.

  J0746425+200032: Exploring the Magnetic Field Topology and Radius of an L
  Dwarf","  [Abridged] We present an 8.5-hour simultaneous radio, X-ray, UV, and optical
observation of the L dwarf binary 2MASSW J0746+20. We detect strong radio
emission, dominated by short-duration periodic pulses at 4.86 GHz with
P=124.32+/-0.11 min. The stability of the pulse profiles and arrival times
demonstrates that they are due to the rotational modulation of a B~1.7 kG
magnetic field. A quiescent non-variable component is also detected, likely due
to emission from a uniform large-scale field. The H-alpha emission exhibits
identical periodicity, but unlike the radio pulses it varies sinusoidally and
is offset by exactly 1/4 of a phase. The sinusoidal variations require
chromospheric emission from a large-scale field structure, with the radio
pulses likely emanating from the magnetic poles. While both light curves can be
explained by a rotating mis-aligned magnetic field, the 1/4 phase lag rules out
a symmetric dipole topology since it would result in a phase lag of 1/2
(poloidal field) or zero (toroidal field). We therefore conclude that either
(i) the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration, which can naturally
explain the 1/4 phase lag; or (ii) the H-alpha and/or radio emission regions
are not trivially aligned with the field. Regardless of the field topology, we
use the measured period along with the known rotation velocity (vsini=27 km/s),
and the binary orbital inclination (i=142 deg), to derive a radius for the
primary star of 0.078+/-0.010 R_sun. This is the first measurement of the
radius of an L dwarf, and along with a mass of 0.085+/-0.010 M_sun it provides
a constraint on the mass-radius relation below 0.1 M_sun. We find that the
radius is about 30% smaller than expected from theoretical models, even for an
age of a few Gyr.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1430v2,Galaxies in a simulated $Λ$CDM Universe I: cold mode and hot cores,"  We study the formation of galaxies in a (50 Mpc/h)^3 cosmological simulation
(2x288^3 particles), evolved using the entropy conserving SPH code Gadget-2.
Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired
through filamentary ""cold mode"" accretion of gas that was never shock heated to
its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results
obtained with a different SPH code (Keres et al. 2005). Atmospheres of hot,
virialized gas develop in halos above ~2.5e11 Msun, a transition mass that is
nearly constant from z=3 to z=0. Cold accretion persists in halos above the
transition mass, especially at z>=2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low
mass halos at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation
history. Satellite galaxies have accretion rates similar to central galaxies of
the same baryonic mass at high redshifts, but they have less accretion than
comparable central galaxies at low redshift. Relative to our earlier results,
the Gadget-2 simulations predict much lower rates of ""hot mode"" accretion from
the virialized gas component of massive halos. At z<=1, typical hot accretion
rates in halos above 5e12 Msun are below 1 Msun/yr, even though our simulation
does not include AGN heating or other forms of ""preventive"" feedback. The inner
density profiles of hot gas in these halos are shallow, with long associated
cooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can
overestimate the accretion rates in these halos by orders of magnitude, so such
models may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed
galaxy masses and colors. A fraction of the massive halos develop cuspy
profiles and significant cooling rates between z=1 and z=0, a redshift trend
similar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.

  theory and observations","  The standard model of gravitational structure formation is based on the Jeans
1902 acoustic theory, neglecting nonlinear instabilities controlled by
viscosity, turbulence and diffusion. Because the Jeans scale L_J for the hot
primordial plasma is always slightly larger than the scale of causal connection
ct, where c is the speed of light and t is the time after the big bang, it has
been assumed that no plasma structures could form without guidance from a cold
(so L_J CDM is small) collisionless cold-dark-matter CDM fluid to give
condensations that gravitationally collect the plasma. Galaxies by this CDM
model form by gradual hierarchical-clustering of CDM halos to galaxy mass over
billions of years. No observations exist of CDM halos. Gravitational
instability is non-linear and absolute, controlled by viscous and turbulent
forces or by diffusivity at Schwarz length scales smaller than ct. Because the
universe during the plasma epoch is rapidly expanding, the first structures
formed were at density minima by fragmentation when the viscous-gravitional
scale L_SV first matched ct at 30,000 years to produce protosupercluster voids
and protosuperclusters. Weak turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries
guide the morphology of smaller fragments down to protogalaxy size just before
transition to gas at 300,000 years. The size of the protogalaxies reflect the

Nomura direct numerical simulations and confirmed by deep field space telescope

without strong feedback to observations at z=0. We confirm previous findings
that models without strong feedback overproduce the observed galaxy baryonic
mass function, especially at the low and high mass extremes. Through
post-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to
reproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme
form of ""preventive"" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic
mass that was originally accreted via ""hot mode"" from shock-heated gas. This
does not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement
with observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at
high redshift from baryons that originally accreted via ""cold mode"" onto lower
mass progenitors. An efficient ""ejective"" feedback mechanism, such as supernova
driven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. Feedback must also
reduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts
and have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically re-map galaxy
masses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation's
predicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the
observed sequence of star-forming galaxies but fail to recover the observed
population of passive, low star formation rate galaxies. Suppressing all hot
mode accretion improves agreement for high mass galaxies but worsens the
agreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z=0 observations requires a
feedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of
galaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other
galaxies essentially unchanged.

0218+3229, a new long-period cataclysmic variable discovered within the Hamburg
Quasar Survey. It is one of the few systems that allow a dynamical measurement
of the masses of the stellar components. Aims. We combine the analysis of
time-resolved optical spectroscopy and R-band photometry with the aim of
measuring the mass of the white dwarf and the donor star and the orbital
inclination. Methods. Cross-correlation of the spectra with K-type dwarf
templates is used to derive the radial velocity curve of the donor star. An
optimal subtraction of the broadened templates is performed to measure the
rotational broadening and constrain the spectral type of the donor. Finally, an
ellipsoidal model is fitted to the R-band light curve to obtain constraints
upon the orbital inclination of the binary system. Results. The orbital period
of HS 0218+3229 is found to be 0.297229661 +- 0.000000001 d (7.13351186 +-
0.00000002 h), and the amplitude of the donor's radial velocity curve is K2 =
162.4 +- 1.4 km/s. Modelling the ellipsoidal light curves gives an orbital
inclination in the range i = 59 +- 3 deg. A rotational broadening between 82.4
+- 1.2 km/s and 89.4 +- 1.3 km/s is found when assuming zero and continuum limb
darkening, respectively. The secondary star has most likely a spectral type K5
and contributes ~ 80-85% to the R-band light. Our analysis yields a mass ratio
of 0.52 < q < 0.65, a white dwarf mass of 0.44 < M1(Msol) < 0.65, and a donor
star mass of 0.23 < M2(Msol) < 0.44. Conclusions. We find that the donor star
in HS 0218+3229 is significantly undermassive for its spectral type. It is

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4554v3,"A New Calculation of the Ionizing Background Spectrum and the Effects of
  HeII Reionization","  The ionizing background determines the ionization balance and the
thermodynamics of the cosmic gas. It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to
theoretical and empirical studies of both the IGM and galaxy formation. We
present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical
constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity
functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model,
star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the HI
ionizing field at z<3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher
redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we
explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how
recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that
recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of
reemitted ionizing photons as many of these rapidly redshift below the
ionization edges and have a distribution of energies. A simple analytic model
that captures the main effects seen in our numerical radiative transfer
calculations is given. Finally, we discuss the effects of HeII reionization by
quasars on both the spectrum of the ionizing background and on the thermal
history of the IGM. In regions that have yet to be reionized, the spectrum is
expected to be almost completely suppressed immediately above 54.4 eV while a
background of higher-energy (>~0.5 keV) photons permeates the entire universe
owing to the frequency-dependence of the photoionization cross section. We
provide an analytic model of the heat input during HeII reionization and its
effects on the temperature-density relation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4787v5,CfA3: 185 Type Ia Supernova Light Curves from the CfA,"  We present multi-band photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia), with over
11500 observations. These were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the F. L.
Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).
This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reduced
nearby SN Ia (z < 0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby
sample, bringing SN Ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties
dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or better
in BVRIr'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We
also estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system
BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our standard system
photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars, where
available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths
mag in most cases. We find that 1991bg-like SN Ia are sufficiently distinct
from other SN Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that
they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training
samples. The CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better
light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where
near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle
host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic
uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2591v2,The Role of Dwarf Galaxies in Building Large Stellar Halos,"  The hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smaller
galactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. The past
decade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, driven
in part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. Multi-object spectroscopy
enabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the Milky Way
and M31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. Improvements in
high-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundance
patterns of the Milky Way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained by
Galactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.
  These breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearby
stars in the Milky Way and luminous red giant stars in M31 and Local Group
dwarf satellites. In the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allow
observations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, and
they will enable observations of individual stars far out in the Galactic halo.
The chemical abundance census now available for the Milky Way will become
possible for our nearest neighbor, M31. Velocity dispersion measurements now
available in M31 will become possible for systems beyond the Local Group such
as Sculptor and M81 Group galaxies. Detailed studies of a greater number of
individual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satellites
will test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemical
evolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses in
different environments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2998v1,The Formation and Architecture of Young Planetary Systems,"  Newly-formed planetary systems with ages of <10 Myr offer many unique
insights into the formation, evolution, and fundamental properties of
extrasolar planets. These planets have fallen beyond the limits of past
surveys, but as we enter the next decade, we stand on the threshold of several
crucial advances in instrumentation and observing techniques that will finally
unveil this critical population. In this white paper, we consider several
classes of planets (inner gas giants, outer gas giants, and ultrawide
planetary-mass companions) and summarize the motivation for their study, the
the observational tests that will distinguish between competing theoretical
models, and the infrastructure investments and policy choices that will best
enable future discovery. We propose that there are two fundamental questions
that must be addressed: 1) Do planets form via core accretion, gravitational
instability, or a combination of the two methods? 2) What do the atmospheres an
interiors of young planets look like, and does the mass-luminosity relation of
young planets more closely resemble the ""hot start"" or ""cold start"" models? To
address these questions, we recommend investment in high-resolution NIR
spectrographs (existing and new), support for innovative new techniques and
pathfinder surveys for directly-imaged young exoplanets, and continued
investment in visible-light adaptive optics to allow full characterization of
wide ""planetary-mass"" companions for calibrating planet evolutionary models. In
summary, testing newly proposed planet formation and evolutionary predictions
will require the identification of a large population of young (<10 Myr)
planets whose orbital, atmospheric, and structural properties can be studied.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0669v4,Correlation Probes of a QCD Critical Point,"  Critical opalescence is a characteristic experimental signature of a second
order phase transition in solid state physics. A new, experimentally accessible
measure of opacity and of attenuation length in heavy ion reactions is
suggested, as a combination of HBT radii and nuclear modification factors. This
opacity is maximal when $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, the system size and centrality
correspond to the critical point of QCD. To characterize the phase transition
at this critical point, the critical exponent of the correlation function can
be determined by measuring the L\'evy index of stability of the Bose-Einstein
or HBT correlations. The exponent of the correlation length can be determined
from fits to the multiplicity distribution in various pseudorapidity intervals,
also as a function of colliding energy, system size, centrality and (chemical)
freeze-out temperature. These two critical exponents determine the remaining
four critical exponents and the universality class of this second order phase
transition. As a control experiment, the determination of the critical exponent
of the specific heat capacity is proposed, from event-by-event fluctuation
measurements. To measure opacity precisely, well calibrated high transverse
momentum probes are needed, such as given by the excitation function of
$\gamma$ + jet correlation functions.

previous work, we successfully demonstrated the trapping of ultracold neutrons

region of an Ioffe-type magnetic trap. A fraction of the neutrons is
downscattered in the helium to energies <200 neV, and those in the appropriate
spin state become trapped. The inverse process is suppressed by the low phonon
density of helium at temperatures less than 200 mK, allowing the neutron to
travel undisturbed. When the neutron decays the energetic electron ionizes the
helium, producing scintillation light that is detected using photomultiplier
tubes. Statistical limitations of the previous apparatus will be alleviated by
significant increases in field strength and trap volume resulting in twenty
times more trapped neutrons.

population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance N_var is
proportional to t_var^alpha, in a range of periods t_var around tens of weeks.
SMBHBs with M < 10^7 M_sun, with 0.5 < alpha < 1.5, would probe the physics of
viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass
binaries, with alpha=8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The
lowest mass SMBHBs (M < 10^{5-6} M_sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short
orbital periods, in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space
Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are strongly sub-dominant in the last

background of near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss constraints on the SMBHB

requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified
from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of

questions about when and where the majority of metals were formed, how they
spread and why they appar today as they are. The evolution of matter in our

http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3385v1,Structure and Evolution of Pre-Main Sequence Stars,"  Low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars are strong and variable X-ray
emitters, as has been well established by EINSTEIN and ROSAT observatories. It
was originally believed that this emission was of thermal nature and primarily
originated from coronal activity (magnetically confined loops, in analogy with
Solar activity) on contracting young stars. Broadband spectral analysis showed
that the emission was not isothermal and that elemental abundances were
non-Solar. The resolving power of the Chandra and XMM X-ray gratings
spectrometers have provided the first, tantalizing details concerning the
physical conditions such as temperatures, densities, and abundances that
characterize the X-ray emitting regions of young star. These existing high
resolution spectrometers, however, simply do not have the effective area to
measure diagnostic lines for a large number of PMS stars over required to
answer global questions such as: how does magnetic activity in PMS stars differ
from that of main sequence stars, how do they evolve, what determines the
population structure and activity in stellar clusters, and how does the
activity influence the evolution of protostellar disks. Highly resolved
(R>3000) X-ray spectroscopy at orders of magnitude greater efficiency than
currently available will provide major advances in answering these questions.
This requires the ability to resolve the key diagnostic emission lines with a
precision of better than 100 km/s.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2966v2,Equivalence Principle Implications of Modified Gravity Models,"  Theories that attempt to explain the observed cosmic acceleration by
modifying general relativity all introduce a new scalar degree of freedom that
is active on large scales, but is screened on small scales to match
experiments. We show that if such screening occurrs via the chameleon mechanism
such as in f(R), it is possible to have order one violation of the equivalence
principle, despite the absence of explicit violation in the microscopic action.
Namely, extended objects such as galaxies or constituents thereof do not all
fall at the same rate. The chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge for
large objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by the
gravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). This leads to
order one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan
frame, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if
the scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld
model, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. We
propose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. small
galaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical friction
is negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared to
standard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should have
different velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical mass
estimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones. We
discuss possible pitfalls in some of these tests. The cleanest is the third one
where mass estimate from HI rotational velocity could exceed that from stars by
30 % or more. To avoid blanket screening of all objects, the most promising
place to look is in voids.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3742v1,Alien Maps of an Ocean-Bearing World,"  [Abridged] To simulate the kinds of observations that will eventually be
obtained for exoplanets, the Deep Impact spacecraft obtained light curves of
Earth at seven wavebands spanning 300-1000 nm as part of the EPOXI mission of
opportunity. In this paper we analyze disc-integrated light curves, treating
Earth as if it were an exoplanet, to determine if we can detect the presence of
oceans and continents. We present two observations each spanning one day, taken
at gibbous phases. The rotation of the planet leads to diurnal albedo
variations of 15-30%, with the largest relative changes occuring at the reddest
wavelengths. To characterize these variations in an unbiased manner we carry
out a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this
analysis reveals that 98% of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only
2 dominant eigencolors. We use the time-variations of these two eigencolors to
construct longitudinal maps of the Earth, treating it as a non-uniform Lambert
sphere. We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors
correspond to cloud-free continents and oceans; this despite the fact that our
observations were taken on days with typical cloud cover. We also find that the
near-infrared wavebands are particularly useful in distinguishing between land
and water. Based on this experiment we conclude that it should be possible to
infer the existence of water oceans on exoplanets with time-resolved broadband
observations taken by a large space-based coronagraphic telescope.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3482v2,Substructure depletion in the Milky Way halo by the disk,"  We employ numerical simulations and simple analytical estimates to argue that
dark matter substructures orbiting in the inner regions of the Galaxy can be
efficiently destroyed by disk shocking, a dynamical process known to affect
globular star clusters. We carry out a set of fiducial high-resolution
collisionless simulations in which we adiabatically grow a disk, allowing us to
examine the impact of the disk on the substructure abundance. We also track the
orbits of dark matter satellites in the high-resolution Aquarius simulations
and analytically estimate the cumulative halo and disk shocking effect. Our
calculations indicate that the presence of a disk with only 10% of the total
Milky Way mass can significantly alter the mass function of substructures in
the inner parts of halos. This has important implications especially for the
relatively small number of satellites seen within ~30 kpc of the Milky Way
center, where disk shocking is expected to reduce the substructure abundance by
a factor of ~2 at 10^9 M$_{\odot}$ and
  ~3 at 10^7 M$_{\odot}$. The most massive subhalos with 10^10
  M$_{\odot}$ survive even in the presence of the disk. This suggests that
there is no inner missing satellite problem, and calls into question whether
these substructures can produce transient features in disks, like multi-armed
spiral patterns. Also, the depletion of dark matter substructures through
shocking on the baryonic structures of the disk and central bulge may aggravate
the problem to fully account for the observed flux anomalies in gravitational
lens systems, and significantly reduces the dark matter annihilation signal
expected from nearby substructures in the inner halo.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0540v3,Simulations of the Microwave Sky,"  We create realistic, full-sky, half-arcminute resolution simulations of the
microwave sky matched to the most recent astrophysical observations. The
primary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment; however, we have widened the
frequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to
other microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these
simulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated
with the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter
structure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters,
groups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ
signals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination
of cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3% (4%)
of halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20% or more. We
find the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz,
less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<1.2 have
their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20% or more. At 148 GHz, less than
20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<0.8 have their SZ
decrements filled in at a level of 50% or larger. Our models also suggest that
a population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed
sources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90
and 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a
useful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power
spectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.

of the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB070724A. The afterglow is detected in
i,J,H,K observations starting 2.3 hr after the burst with K=19.59+/-0.16 mag
and i=23.79+/-0.07 mag, but is absent in images obtained 1.3 years later.
Fading is also detected in the K-band between 2.8 and 3.7 hr at a 4-sigma
significance level. The optical/near-IR spectral index, beta_{O,NIR}=-2, is
much redder than expected in the standard afterglow model, pointing to either
significant dust extinction, A_{V,host}~2 mag, or a non-afterglow origin for
the near-IR emission. The case for extinction is supported by a shallow optical
to X-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',
and a normal near-IR to X-ray spectral index. Moreover, a comparison to the
optical discovery magnitudes of all short GRBs with optical afterglows
indicates that the near-IR counterpart of GRB070724A is one of the brightest to
date, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. In the
context of a non-afterglow origin, the near-IR emission may be dominated by a
mini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of M~10^-4 Msun and a
radioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c). However, the
mini-SN model predicts a spectral peak in the UV rather than near-IR,
suggesting that this is either not the correct interpretation or that the
mini-SN models need to be revised. Finally, the afterglow coincides with a star
forming galaxy at z=0.457, previously identified as the host based on its
coincidence with the X-ray afterglow position (~2"" radius). Our discovery of
the optical/near-IR afterglow makes this association secure.

  II. Distribution and origin of warm molecular gas","  The origin and heating mechanisms of warm (50<T<200 K) molecular gas in

heating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as well
as active heating by shocks and by UV associated with the outflows or accretion
have been proposed. We aim to characterize the warm gas within protosteller
objects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolar
outflows and the quiescent cloud. High-J CO maps (12CO J=6--5 and 7--6) of the
immediate surroundings (up to 10,000 AU) of eight low-mass YSOs are obtained
with the CHAMP+ 650/850 GHz array receiver mounted on the APEX telescope. In
addition, isotopologue observations of the 13CO J=6--5 transition and [C I]
3P_2-3P_1 line were taken. Strong quiescent narrow-line 12CO 6--5 and 7--6
emission is seen toward all protostars. In the case of HH~46 and Ced 110 IRS 4,
the on-source emission originates in material heated by UV photons scattered in
the outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. Warm
quiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by UV photons from
shocks. Shock-heated warm gas is only detected for Class 0 flows and the more
massive Class I sources such as HH~46. Outflow temperatures, estimated from the
CO 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 K, close to model predictions, with the
exception of the L~1551 IRS 5 and IRAS 12496-7650, for which temperatures <50 K
are found. APEX-CHAMP+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar's

we measure an orbital period of 48.31 +/- 0.08 min. The continuum emission can
be described with a blackbody or a helium white dwarf atmosphere of T_eff ~
15,000K, in agreement with theoretical cooling models for relatively massive
accretors and/or donors. The absence in the spectrum of broad helium absorption
lines from the accreting white dwarf suggests that the accreting white dwarf
cannot be much hotter than 15,000K, or that an additional component such as the
accretion disk contributes substantially to the optical flux.

  ATLAS detector","  The Fast Tracker (FTK) is a proposed upgrade to the ATLAS trigger system that
will operate at full Level-1 output rates and provide high quality tracks
reconstructed over the entire detector by the start of processing in Level-2.
FTK solves the combinatorial challenge inherent to tracking by exploiting the
massive parallelism of Associative Memories (AM) that can compare inner
detector hits to millions of pre-calculated patterns simultaneously. The
tracking problem within matched patterns is further simplified by using
pre-computed linearized fitting constants and leveraging fast DSP's in modern
commercial FPGA's. Overall, FTK is able to compute the helix parameters for all
tracks in an event and apply quality cuts in approximately one millisecond. By
employing a pipelined architecture, FTK is able to continuously operate at
Level-1 rates without deadtime. The system design is defined and studied using
ATLAS full simulation. Reconstruction quality is evaluated for single muon
events with zero pileup, as well as WH events at the LHC design luminosity. FTK
results are compared with the tracking capability of an offline algorithm.

  Frequency VLBI","  Sagittarius A* is the source of near infrared, X-ray, radio, and
(sub)millimeter emission associated with the supermassive black hole at the
Galactic Center. In the submillimeter regime, Sgr A* exhibits time-variable
linear polarization on timescales corresponding to <10 Schwarzschild radii of
the presumed 4 million solar mass black hole. In previous work, we demonstrated
the potential for total-intensity (sub)millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect
time-variable -- and periodic -- source structure changes in the Sgr A* black
hole system using nonimaging analyses. Here we extend this work to include full
polarimetric VLBI observations. We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter
VLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion
disk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust
against calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization
fraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization
fraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of
changes in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.
The shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization
fraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures
that are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of
periodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly
affected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out. As
more antennas are included in the (sub)mm-VLBI array, observations with full
polarization will provide important new diagnostics to help disentangle
intrinsic source polarization from Faraday rotation effects in the accretion
and outflow region close to the black hole event horizon.

  Variability","  [Abridged] We present the first comprehensive study of short-timescale
chromospheric H-alpha variability in M dwarfs using the individual 15 min
spectroscopic exposures for 52,392 objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Our sample contains about 10^3-10^4 objects per spectral type bin in the range
M0-M9, with a total of about 206,000 spectra and a typical number of 3
exposures per object (ranging up to a maximum of 30 exposures). Using this
extensive data set we find that about 16% of the sources exhibit H-alpha
emission in at least one exposure, and of those about 45% exhibit H-alpha
emission in all of the available exposures. Within the sample of objects with
H-alpha emission, only 26% are consistent with non-variable emission,
independent of spectral type. The H-alpha variability, quantified in terms of
the ratio of maximum to minimum H-alpha equivalent width (R_EW), and the ratio
of the standard deviation to the mean (sigma_EW/<EW>), exhibits a rapid rise
from M0 to M5, followed by a plateau and a possible decline in M9 objects. In
particular, R_EW increases from a median value of about 1.8 for M0-M3 to about
2.5 for M7-M9, and variability with R_EW>10 is only observed in objects later
than M5. For the combined sample we find that the R_EW values follow an
exponential distribution with N(R_EW) exp[-(R_EW-1)/2]; for M5-M9 objects the
characteristic scale is R_EW-1\approx 2.7, indicative of stronger variability.
In addition, we find that objects with persistent H-alpha emission exhibit
smaller values of R_EW than those with intermittent H-alpha emission. Based on
these results we conclude that H-alpha variability in M dwarfs on timescales of
15 min to 1 hr increases with later spectral type, and that the variability is
larger for intermittent sources.

drawn from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS), based on high
resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the cluster cores and follow-up
spectroscopic observations using the Keck-I telescope. We use detailed
parameterized models of the mass distribution in the cluster cores, to measure
the total cluster mass and fraction of that mass associated with substructures
within R<250kpc.These measurements are compared with the distribution of
baryons in the cores, as traced by the old stellar populations and the X-ray
emitting intracluster medium. Our main results include: (i) the distribution of
Einstein radii is log-normal, with a peak and 1sigma width of
<log(RE(z=2))>=1.16+/-0.28; (ii) we detect an X-ray/lensing mass discrepancy of
<M_SL/M_X>=1.3 at 3 sigma significance -- clusters with larger substructure
fractions displaying greater mass discrepancies, and thus greater departures
from hydrostatic equilibrium; (iii) cluster substructure fraction is also
correlated with the slope of the gas density profile on small scales, implying
a connection between cluster-cluster mergers and gas cooling. Overall our
results are consistent with the view that cluster-cluster mergers play a
prominent role in shaping the properties of cluster cores, in particular
causing departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, and possibly disturbing cool
cores. Our results do not support recent claims that large Einstein radius
clusters present a challenge to the CDM paradigm.

  Time","  We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type IIn
supernova (SN) 2008iy. SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of
~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to
reach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r
~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x
10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN
1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both
supernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission
profile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a
pre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is
powered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar
medium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of
clumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the
progenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic
phase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor
wind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the
former scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes
observed for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and
increased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and
perhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before
core collapse. We also discuss the host galaxy of SN 2008iy, a subluminous
dwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons why the recent suggestion that unusual,
luminous supernovae preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result of
observational biases.

and velocity dispersion in cold dark matter (CDM) halos. In particular, we
explore how closely Q rho/sigma^3, a surrogate measure of the phase-space
density, follows a power-law in radius. Our study extends earlier work by
considering, in addition to spherically-averaged profiles, local Q-estimates
for individual particles, Q_i; profiles based on the ellipsoidal radius
dictated by the triaxial structure of the halo, Q_i(r'); and by carefully
removing substructures in order to focus on the profile of the smooth halo,
Q^s. The resulting Q_i^s(r') profiles follow closely a power law near the
center, but show a clear upturn from this trend near the virial radius,
r_{200}. The location and magnitude of the deviations are in excellent
agreement with the predictions from Bertschinger's spherical secondary-infall
similarity solution. In this model, Q \propto r^{-1.875} in the inner,
virialized regions, but departures from a power-law occur near r_{200} because
of the proximity of this radius to the location of the first shell crossing -
the shock radius in the case of a collisional fluid. Particles there have not
yet fully virialized, and so Q departs from the inner power-law profile. Our
results imply that the power-law nature of $Q$ profiles only applies to the
inner regions and cannot be used to predict accurately the structure of CDM
halos beyond their characteristic scale radius.

fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic LCDM
initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with
the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically
converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and
their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective
resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved
by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these
methods to the six Milky Way-mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from
halo centre a typical point intersects about 10^14 streams with a very broad
range of individual densities; the ~10^6 most massive streams contribute about
half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution
of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most massive
fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1% of the total signal. Dark matter
particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the Big Bang.
The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie
well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a
negligible boost (<0.1%) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate.
The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10%.
Thus fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the
detectability of dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories, or
indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant
cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most massive local
fine-grained streams because of their extreme localisation in energy/momentum
space. (abridged)

a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This cosmic
magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves the
star-forming regions at a linear scale of just ~100 parsecs. We find that the
luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense
cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are ~100x
larger and 10^7 times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the
underlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similar
to that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anything
found in the present-day Universe.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1068v2,"The Environments of Short-Duration Gamma-Ray Bursts and Implications for
  their Progenitors","  [Abridged] The study of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) experienced a
complete revolution in recent years thanks to the discovery of the first
afterglows and host galaxies in May 2005. These observations demonstrated that
short GRBs are cosmological in origin, reside in both star forming and
elliptical galaxies, are not associated with supernovae, and span a wide
isotropic-equivalent energy range of ~10^48-10^52 erg. However, a fundamental
question remains unanswered: What are the progenitors of short GRBs? The most
popular theoretical model invokes the coalescence of compact object binaries
with neutron star and/or black hole constituents. However, additional
possibilities exist, including magnetars formed through prompt channels
(massive star core-collapse) and delayed channels (binary white dwarf mergers,
white dwarf accretion-induced collapse), or accretion-induced collapse of
neutron stars. In this review I summarize our current knowledge of the galactic
and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and use these observations to draw
inferences about the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i)
some short GRBs explode in dead elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short
GRBs occur in star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs
are distinct from those of long GRBs (lower star formation rates, and higher
luminosities and metallicities), and instead appear to be drawn from the
general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs
relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long
GRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution is in good agreement with
predictions for NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) short GRBs trace under-luminous
locations within their hosts, but appear to be more closely correlated with the
rest-frame optical light (old stars) than the UV light (young massive stars).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3041v2,Lyman-alpha Cooling Emission from Galaxy Formation,"  Recent studies have shown that galaxies accrete most of their baryons via the
cold mode, from streams with temperatures T~10^4-10^5 K. At these temperatures,
the streams should radiate primarily in the Lya line and have therefore been
proposed as a model to power the extended, high-redshift objects known as Lya
blobs and other high-redshift Lya sources. We introduce a new Lya radiative
transfer code, aRT, and apply it to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We
address physical and numerical issues that are critical to making accurate
predictions for the cooling luminosity, but that have been mostly neglected or
treated simplistically so far. We highlight the importance of self-shielding
and of properly treating sub-resolution models in simulations. Most existing
simulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead
to order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a
combination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation
techniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the
self-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lya cooling luminosity on
halo mass at z=3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion. While
cooling in massive halos (without additional energy input from star formation
and AGN) is in principle sufficient to produce L_alpha~10^43-10^44 erg s^-1
blobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to
form stars, but which is kept 100% gaseous in our optimistic estimates.
Excluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one
to two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the
observed Lya blobs with pure cooling. Resonant scattering produces diffuse Lya
halos, even for centrally concentrated emission, and broad double peaked line
profiles. [Abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4056v2,Testing Two-Field Inflation,"  We derive semi-analytic formulae for the power spectra of two-field inflation
assuming an arbitrary potential and non-canonical kinetic terms, and we use
them both to build phenomenological intuition and to constrain classes of
two-field models using WMAP data. Using covariant formalism, we first develop a
framework for understanding the background field kinematics and introduce a
""slow-turn"" approximation. Next, we find covariant expressions for the
evolution of the adiabatic/curvature and entropy/isocurvature modes, and we
discuss how the mode evolution can be inferred directly from the background
kinematics and the geometry of the field manifold. From these expressions, we
derive semi-analytic formulae for the curvature, isocurvature, and cross
spectra, and the spectral observables, all to second-order in the slow-roll and
slow-turn approximations. In tandem, we show how our covariant formalism
provides useful intuition into how the characteristics of the inflationary
Lagrangian translate into distinct features in the power spectra. In
particular, we find that key features of the power spectra can be directly read
off of the nature of the roll path, the curve the field vector rolls along with
respect to the field manifold. For example, models whose roll path makes a
sharp turn 60 e-folds before inflation ends tend to be ruled out because they
produce strong departures from scale invariance. Finally, we apply our
formalism to confront four classes of two-field models with WMAP data,
including doubly quadratic and quartic potentials and non-standard kinetic
terms, showing how whether a model is ruled out depends not only on certain
features of the inflationary Lagrangian, but also on the initial conditions.
Ultimately, models must possess the right balance of kinematical and dynamical
behaviors, which we capture in a set of functions that can be reconstructed
from spectral observables.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4406v2,Intergalactic Dust Extinction in Hydrodynamic Cosmological Simulations,"  Recently Menard et al. detected a subtle but systematic change in the mean
color of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foreground
galaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10Mpc/h, which they interpret
as a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. We present theoretical
models of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a
(50Mpc/h)^3 volume. Our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds and
assumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. The predicted galaxy-dust
correlation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlation
function, and reproducing the MSFR data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of
0.24, about half the value in the Galactic ISM. Roughly half of the reddening
arises in dust that is more than 100Kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. We
also examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smaller
fraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires an
unphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the MSFR data. In both
models, the signal is dominated by sightlines with E(g-i)=0.001-0.1. The
no-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddening
to arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 Msun. The wind model predicts a mean
visual extinction of A_V ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with a
sightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could be
significant for future supernova cosmology studies. Reproducing the MSFR
results in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ISM dust survive
its expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.
Future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure the
dependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for models
of enriched galactic outflows and the survival of IG dust.

observations of 14,882 sample galaxies over an interval of 11 years (March 1998

optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe~Ia, 116 SNe~Ibc, 324 SNe~II) to determine
our SN rates. This is the largest and most homogeneous set of nearby SNe ever
assembled for this purpose, and ours is the first local SN rate analysis based
on CCD imaging and modern image-subtraction techniques. In this paper, we lay
the foundation of the study. We derive the recipe for the control-time
calculation for SNe with a known luminosity function, and provide details on
the construction of the galaxy and SN samples used in the calculations.
Compared with a complete volume-limited galaxy sample, our sample has a deficit
of low-luminosity galaxies but still provides enough statistics for a reliable
rate calculation. There is a strong Malmquist bias, so the average size
(luminosity or mass) of the galaxies increases monotonically with distance, and
this trend is used to showcase a correlation between SN rates and galaxy sizes.
Very few core-collapse SNe are found in early-type galaxies, providing strong
constraints on the amount of recent star formation within these galaxies. The
small average observation interval ($\sim 9$ days) of our survey ensures that
our control-time calculations can tolerate a reasonable amount of uncertainty
in the luminosity functions of SNe. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to
determine the limiting magnitude of each image and the SN detection efficiency

split between single dipole experiments which integrate over a large patch of
sky in order to find the global (spectral) signature of reionization, and
interferometers with arcminute-scale angular resolution whose goal is to
measure the 3D power spectrum of ionized regions during reionization. We
examine whether intermediate scale instruments with complete Fourier (uv)
coverage are capable of placing new constraints on reionization. We find that
even without using a full power spectrum analysis, the global redshift of
reionization, z_reion, can in principle be measured from the variance in the
21-cm signal among multiple beams as a function of frequency at a roughly 1
degree angular scale. At this scale, the beam-to-beam variance in the
differential brightness temperature peaks when the average neutral fraction was
around 50%, providing a convenient flag of z_reion. We choose a low angular
resolution of order 1 degree to exploit the physical size of the ionized
regions and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Thermal noise, foregrounds, and
instrumental effects should also be manageable at this angular scale, as long
as the uv coverage is complete within the compact core required for
low-resolution imaging. For example, we find that z_reion can potentially be

environments of several short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with
sub-arcsecond optical afterglow positions but no bright coincident host

of significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.
Five such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical
afterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are
systematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst
densities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),
or to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray
fluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale
environments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying
hosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near
each burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence
(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10"",
while somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with
faint galaxies at separations of ~2"". By measuring redshifts for the brighter
galaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of

~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be
explained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two
possibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the
centers of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due
to the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and

It possesses physical properties intermediate to those of the peculiar SN

that it had an extraordinarily fast rise time of <= 10 days and a peak absolute
B magnitude of -15.4 +/- 0.2 at most, making it one of the most subluminous SN

unambiguously shows the presence of intermediate-mass elements which are likely
caused by carbon/oxygen nuclear burning. Near maximum brightness, SN 2007qd had

which the mean enclosed density is 2500 times the critical density,
r_2500=283(+18/-13)kpc, of 1.02 (+0.21/-0.14)x10^14 M_sun. The gas mass
fraction within this radius is f_gas=0.129(+0.015/-0.016). This value is
consistent with measurements at lower redshifts and implies minimal evolution
in the f_gas(z) relation for hot, massive clusters at 0<z<1.1. The measured
metal abundance of 0.42(+0.08/-0.07) Solar is consistent with the abundance
observed in other massive, high redshift clusters. The spatially-resolved
temperature profile for the cluster shows a drop in temperature, from kT~8 keV
to kT~3 keV, in its central regions that is characteristic of cooling core
clusters. This is the first spectroscopic identification of a cooling core
cluster at z>1. We measure cooling times for the X-ray emitting gas at radii of
50 kpc and 25 kpc of 1.7(+/-0.2)x10^9 years and 7.5(+/-2.6)x 10^8 years, as
well as a nominal cooling rate (in the absence of heating) of
400(+/-190)M_sun/year within the central 100 kpc. In principle, the cooling gas
can supply enough fuel to support the growth of the supermassive black hole and
to power the luminous quasar. The radiative power of the quasar exceeds by a
factor of 10 the kinematic power of the central radio source, suggesting that
radiative heating may be important at intermittent intervals in cluster cores.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3313v2,"Gravitational recoils of supermassive black holes in hydrodynamical
  simulations of gas rich galaxies","  We study the evolution of gravitationally recoiled supermassive black holes
(BHs) in massive gas-rich galaxies by means of high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations. We find that the presence of a massive gaseous disc allows
recoiled BHs to return to the centre on a much shorter timescale than for
purely stellar discs. Also, BH accretion and feedback can strongly modify the
orbit of recoiled BHs and hence their return timescale, besides affecting the
distribution of gas and stars in the galactic centre. However, the dynamical
interaction of kicked BHs with the surrounding medium is in general complex and
can facilitate both a fast return to the centre as well as a significant delay.
The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rates of the recoiling BHs in our simulated
galaxies are favourably high for the detection of off-centred AGN if kicked
within gas-rich discs -- up to a few per cent of the Eddington accretion rate
-- and are highly variable on timescales of a few 10^7 yrs. In major merger
simulations of gas-rich galaxies, we find that gravitational recoils increase
the scatter in the BH mass -- host galaxy relationships compared to simulations
without kicks, with the BH mass being more sensitive to recoil kicks than the
bulge mass. A generic result of our numerical models is that the clumpy massive
discs suggested by recent high-redshift observations, as well as the remnants
of gas-rich mergers, exhibit a gravitational potential that falls steeply in
the central regions, due to the dissipative concentration of baryons. As a
result, supermassive BHs should only rarely be able to escape from massive
galaxies at high redshifts, which is the epoch where the bulk of BH recoils is
expected to occur.[Abridged]

  of life","  We explore the conditions prevailing in primordial planets in the framework
of the HGD cosmologies as discussed by Gibson and Schild. The initial stages of
condensation of planet-mass H-4He gas clouds in trillion-planet clumps is set
at 300,000 yr (0.3My) following the onset of plasma instabilities when ambient
temperatures were >1000K. Eventual collapse of the planet-cloud into a solid
structure takes place against the background of an expanding universe with
declining ambient temperatures. Stars form from planet mergers within the
clumps and die by supernovae on overeating of planets. For planets produced by
stars, isothermal free fall collapse occurs initially via quasi equilibrium
polytropes until opacity sets in due to molecule and dust formation. The
contracting cooling cloud is a venue for molecule formation and the sequential
condensation of solid particles, starting from mineral grains at high
temperatures to ice particles at lower temperatures, water-ice becomes
thermodynamically stable between 7 and 15 My after the initial onset of
collapse, and contraction to form a solid icy core begins shortly thereafter.
Primordial-clump-planets are separated by ~ 1000 AU, reflecting the high
density of the universe at 30,000 yr. Exchanges of materials, organic molecules
and evolving templates readily occur, providing optimal conditions for an
initial origin of life in hot primordial gas planet water cores when adequately
fertilized by stardust. The condensation of solid molecular hydrogen as an
extended outer crust takes place much later in the collapse history of the
protoplanet. When the object has shrunk to several times the radius of Jupiter,
the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds the saturation vapour pressure of solid
hydrogen at the ambient temperature and condensation occurs.

  the Progenitor Delay Time Distribution and the Role of Mass and Star
  Formation in the Short GRB Rate","  [Abridged] We present optical and NIR observations of 19 short GRB host
galaxies, aimed at measuring their stellar masses and population ages. The
goals of this study are to evaluate whether short GRBs track the stellar mass
distribution of galaxies, to investigate the progenitor delay time
distribution, and to explore any connection between long and short GRB
progenitors. Using single stellar population models we infer masses of
log(M/M_sun)=8.8-11.6 and population ages of tau=0.03-4.4 Gyr. We further infer
maximal masses of log(M/M_sun)=9.7-11.9 by assuming stellar population ages
equal to the age of the universe at each host's redshift. Comparing the
distribution of stellar masses to the general galaxy mass function we find that
short GRBs track the cosmic stellar mass distribution only if the late-type
hosts generally have maximal masses. However, there is an apparent dearth of
early-type hosts compared to the equal contribution of early- and late-type
galaxies to the cosmic stellar mass budget. These results suggest that stellar
mass may not be the sole parameter controlling the short GRB rate, and raise
the possibility of a two-component model with both mass and star formation
playing a role. If short GRBs in late-type galaxies indeed track the star
formation activity, the resulting typical delay time is ~0.2 Gyr, while those
in early-type hosts have a typical delay of ~3 Gyr. Using the same stellar
population models we fit the data for 22 long GRB hosts and find that they have
lower masses and younger population ages, with <log(M/M_sun)>=9.1 and
<tau>=0.06 Gyr, respectively; their maximal masses are similarly lower,
<log(M/M_sun)>=9.6. Most importantly, the two host populations remain distinct
even if we consider only the star-forming hosts of short GRBs, supporting our
previous findings that the progenitors of long GRBs and short GRBs in late-type
galaxies are distinct.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1160v1,A Conversation with James Hannan,"  Jim Hannan is a professor who has lived an interesting life and one whose
fundamental research in repeated games was not fully appreciated until late in
his career. During his service as a meteorologist in the Army in World War II,
Jim played poker and made weather forecasts. It is curious that his later
research included strategies for repeated play that apply to selecting the best
forecaster. James Hannan was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts on September 14,
1922. He attended St. Jerome's High School and in January 1943 received the
Ph.B. from St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont. Jim enlisted in the US
Army Air Force to train and serve as a meteorologist. This took him to army
airbases in China by the close of the war. Following discharge from the army,
Jim studied mathematics at Harvard and graduated with the M.S. in June 1947. To
prepare for doctoral work in statistics at the University of North Carolina
that fall, Jim went to the University of Michigan in the summer of 1947. The
routine admissions' physical revealed a spot on the lung and the possibility of
tuberculosis. This caused Jim to stay at Ann Arbor through the fall of 1947 and
then at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham, Massachusetts to have
his condition followed more closely. He was discharged from the hospital in the
spring and started his study at Chapel Hill in the fall of 1948. There he began
research in compound decision theory under Herbert Robbins. Feeling the need
for teaching experience, Jim left Chapel Hill after two years and short of
thesis to take a three year appointment as an instructor at Catholic University
in Washington, DC. When told that renewal was not coming, Jim felt pressure to
finish his degree.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2282v2,Unification of Luminous Type 1 Quasars through CIV Emission,"  Using a sample of 30,000 quasars from SDSS-DR7, we explore the range of
properties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as CIV
1549. Specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between L_UV and
emission line EQW (the Baldwin Effect) and the ""blueshifting"" of
high-ionization emission lines. The blueshift of the CIV emission line is
nearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (RQ) quasars
and 360 km/s for radio-loud (RL) quasars, and the Baldwin Effect is present in
both RQ and RL samples. Composite spectra are constructed as a function of CIV
emission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships between
different line species and the SED. Within a two-component disk+wind model of
the broad emission line region (BELR), where the wind filters the continuum
seen by the disk component, we find that RL quasars are consistent with being
dominated by the disk component, while BALQSOs are consistent with being
dominated by the wind component. Some RQ objects have emission line features
similar to RL quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (BH) spin
to form radio jets. Our results suggest that there could be significant
systematic errors in the determination of L_bol and BH mass that make it
difficult to place these findings in a more physical context. However, it is
possible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of BELR
parameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars
(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the SED, which
ultimately must be tied to BH mass and accretion rate.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2770v1,"Evidence for Low Black Hole Spin and Physically Motivated Accretion
  Models from Millimeter VLBI Observations of Sagittarius A*","  Millimeter very-long baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides the novel
capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive black holes
on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the
immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. (2009) have already shown
that by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion
theory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black
hole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes.
Here we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a
class of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find
that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux
distribution at the 3.9-sigma level, strongly favoring length-to-width ratios
of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically motivated accretion
flow models provide a significantly better fit to the mm-VLBI observations than
phenomenological models, at the 2.9-sigma level. This implies that not only is
mm-VLBI presently capable of distinguishing between potential physical models
for Sgr A*'s emission, but further that it is sensitive to the strong
gravitational lensing associated with the propagation of photons near the black
hole. Based upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude,
viewing angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are
a=0.0(+0.64+0.86), theta=68(+5+9)(-20-28) degrees, and xi=-52(+17+33)(-15-24)

d\approx150 Mpc obtained with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope in
2004-2007. This study represents the first uniform, systematic, and statistical
sample of multi-band SNe Ibc light curves available to date. We correct the
light curves for host galaxy extinction using a new technique based on the
photometric color evolution, namely, we show that the (V-R) color of
extinction-corrected SNe Ibc at t\approx10 days after V-band maximum is tightly
distributed, (V-R)=0.26+-0.06 mag. Using this technique, we find that SNe Ibc
typically suffer from significant host galaxy extinction, E(B-V)\approx0.4 mag.
A comparison of the extinction-corrected light curves for SNe Ib and Ic reveals
that they are statistically indistinguishable, both in luminosity and decline
rate. We report peak absolute magnitudes of M_R=-17.9+-0.9 mag and
M_R=-18.3+-0.6 mag for SNe Ib and Ic, respectively. Focusing on the broad-lined
SNe Ic, we find that they are more luminous than the normal SNe Ibc sample,
M_R=-19.0+-1.1 mag, with a probability of only 1.6% that they are drawn from
the same population of explosions. By comparing the peak absolute magnitudes of
SNe Ic-BL with those inferred for local engine-driven explosions (GRB-SN
1998bw, XRF-SN 2006aj, and SN2009bb) we find a 25% probability that they are
drawn from the SNe Ic-BL population. Finally, we fit analytic models to the
light-curves to derive typical Ni-56 masses of M_Ni \approx0.2 and 0.5 M_sun
for SNe Ibc and SNe Ic-BL, respectively. With reasonable assumptions for the
photospheric velocities, we extract kinetic energy and ejecta mass values of
M_ej \approx 2 M_sun and E_K\approx1e+51 erg for SNe Ibc, while for SNe Ic-BL
we find higher values, M_ej\approx5 M_sun and E_K\approx1e+52 erg. We discuss
the implications for the progenitors of SNe Ibc and their relation to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4009v1,"The Optical Afterglow and z=0.92 Early-type Host Galaxy of the Short GRB
  100117A","  We present the discovery of the optical afterglow and early-type host galaxy
of the short-duration GRB 100117A. The faint afterglow is detected 8.3 hr after
the burst with r_AB = 25.46 +/- 0.20 mag. Follow-up optical and near-IR
observations uncover a coincident compact red galaxy, identified as an
early-type galaxy at a photometric redshift of z~0.6-0.9 (2-sigma) with a mass
of 3x10^10 M_Sun, an age of ~1 Gyr, and a luminosity of L_B~0.5L_star.
Spectroscopic observations of the host reveal a notable break corresponding to
the Balmer 4000-Angstrom break at z~0.9, and stellar population spectral
evolution template fits indicate z~0.915, which we adopt as the redshift of the
host, with stellar population ages of ~1-3 Gyr. From a possible weak detection
of [OII]-3727 emission at z=0.915 we infer an upper bound on the star formation
rate of ~0.1 M_Sun per yr, leading to a specific star formation rate of <0.004
per Gyr. Thus, GRB 100117A is only the second short burst to date with a secure
early-type host (the other being GRB 050724 at z=0.257) and it has one of the
highest short GRB redshifts. The offset between the host center and the burst
position, 470 +/- 310 pc, is the smallest to date. Combined with the old
stellar population age, this indicates that the burst likely originated from a
progenitor with no significant kick velocity. However, from the brightness of
the optical afterglow we infer a relatively low density of n~3x10^-4 cm^-3 when
epsilon_e and epsilon_B = 0.1. The combination of an optically faint afterglow
and host suggest that previous such events may have been missed, thereby
potentially biasing the known short GRB host population against z>1 early-type
hosts.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5859v2,"Dark halo response and the stellar initial mass function in early-type
  and late-type galaxies","  We investigate the origin of the relations between stellar mass and optical
circular velocity for early-type (ETG) and late-type (LTG) galaxies --- the
Faber-Jackson (FJ) and Tully-Fisher (TF) relations. We combine measurements of
dark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and the
distribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scaling
relations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmological
simulations. The principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formation
and the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The slopes of the TF and FJ
relations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and IMFs.
However, models with a universal IMF and universal halo response cannot
simultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the TF and FJ relations. For a
model with a universal Chabrier IMF, LTGs require halo expansion, while ETGs
require halo contraction. A Salpeter IMF is permitted for high mass (sigma >
180 km/s) ETGs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unless
V_circ(R_e)/sigma_e > 1.6. If the IMF is universal and close to Chabrier, we
speculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for the
contraction in ETGs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads to
expansion in LTGs. Alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the IMF
disfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. Finally we show that our
models naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profiles
within the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1967v1,Rotation periods for very low mass stars in Praesepe,"  We investigate the rotation periods of fully convective very low mass stars
(VLM, M<0.3 Msol), with the aim to derive empirical constraints for the
spindown due to magnetically driven stellar winds. Our analysis is based on a
new sample of rotation periods in the main-sequence cluster Praesepe (age 600
Myr). From photometric lightcurves obtained with the Isaac Newton Telescope, we
measure rotation periods for 49 objects, among them 26 in the VLM domain. This
enlarges the period sample in this mass and age regime by a factor of 6. Almost
all VLM objects in our sample are fast rotators with periods <2.5 d, in
contrast to the stars with M>0.6 Msol in this cluster which have periods of
7-14 d. Thus, we confirm that the period-mass distribution in Praesepe exhibits
a radical break at M~0.3-0.6 Msol. Our data indicate a positive period-mass
trend in the VLM regime, similar to younger clusters. In addition, the scatter
of the periods increases with mass. For the M>0.3 Msol objects in our sample
the period distribution is probably affected by binarity. By comparing the
Praesepe periods with literature samples in the cluster NGC2516 (age ~150 Myr)
we constrain the spindown in the VLM regime. An exponential rotational braking
law P ~ exp(t/tau) with a mass-dependent tau is required to reproduce the data.
The spindown timescale tau increases steeply towards lower masses; we derive
tau~0.5 Gyr for 0.3 Msol and >1 Gyr for 0.1 Msol. These constraints are
consistent with the current paradigm of the spindown due to wind braking. We
discuss possible physical origins of this behaviour and prospects for future
work.

  Detecting Snowball Planets","  We have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations of
Earth's poles with the Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI Mission of
Opportunity. These data mimic what we will see when we point next-generation
space telescopes at nearby exoplanets. We use principal component analysis
(PCA) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneities
and map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as a
complement to the equatorial views presented in Cowan et al. (2009). We also
perform the same PCA on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurves
from NASA's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model. This
numerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA
can robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar
broadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent
albedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to
mid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes
emphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the
mid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at
short wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor
in the south polar observation. We construct a simple reflectance model for a
snowball Earth. By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the
modern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not
noticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short
wavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in
those wavebands. Thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal color
variations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-day
Earth, regardless of viewing angle.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0776v2,The cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray background from dark matter annihilation,"  (Abridged) The extragalactic background light (EBL) observed at multiple
wavelengths is a promising tool to probe the nature of dark matter since it
might contain a significant contribution from gamma-rays produced promptly by
dark matter annihilation. Additionally, the electrons and positrons produced in
the annihilation give energy to the CMB photons to populate the EBL with X-rays
and gamma-rays. We here create full-sky maps of the radiation from both of
these contributions using the high-resolution Millennium-II simulation. We use
upper limits on the contributions of unknown sources to the EBL to constrain
the intrinsic properties of dark matter using a model-independent approach that
can be employed as a template to test different particle physics models
(including those with a Sommerfeld enhancement). These upper limits are based
on observations spanning eight orders of magnitude in energy (from soft X-rays
measured by CHANDRA to gamma-rays measured by Fermi), and on expectations for
the contributions from blazars and star forming galaxies. To exemplify this
approach, we analyze a set of benchmark Sommerfeld-enhanced models that give
the correct dark matter abundance, satisfy CMB constraints, and fit the cosmic
ray spectra measured by PAMELA and Fermi without any contribution from local
subhalos. We find that these models are in conflict with the EBL constraints
unless the contribution of unresolved subhalos is small and the annihilation
signal dominates the EBL. We conclude that provided the collisionless cold dark
matter paradigm is accurate, even for conservative estimates of the
contribution from unresolved subhalos and astrophysical backgrounds, the EBL is
at least as sensitive a probe of these types of scenarios as the CMB. Our
results disfavor an explanation of the positron excess measured by PAMELA based
only on dark matter annihilation in the smooth Galactic halo.

determine the Hubble constant (H0) from optical and infrared observations of
over 600 Cepheid variables in the host galaxies of 8 recent Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia), providing the calibration for a mag-z relation of 253 SNe Ia.
Increased precision over past measurements comes from: (1) more than doubling
the number of infrared observations of Cepheids in nearby SN hosts; (2)
increasing the sample of ideal SN Ia calibrators from six to eight; (3)
increasing by 20% the number of Cepheids with infrared observations in the
megamaser host NGC 4258; (4) reducing the difference in the mean metallicity of
the Cepheid comparison samples from \Delta log [O/H] = 0.08 to 0.05; and (5)
calibrating all optical Cepheid colors with one camera, WFC3, to remove
cross-instrument zero-point errors. Uncertainty in H0 from beyond the 1st rung
of the distance ladder is reduced from 3.5% to 2.3%. The measurement of H0 via
the geometric distance to NGC 4258 is 74.8 \pm 3.1 km s- 1 Mpc-1, a 4.1%
measurement including systematics. Better precision independent of NGC 4258
comes from two alternative Cepheid absolute calibrations: (1) 13 Milky Way
Cepheids with parallaxes and (2) 92 Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud with
multiple eclipsing binary distances, yielding 74.4 \pm 2.5 km s- 1 Mpc-1, a
3.4% uncertainty with systematics. Our best estimate uses all three
calibrations but a larger uncertainty afforded from any two: H0 = 73.8 \pm 2.4
km s- 1 Mpc-1 including systematics, a 3.3% uncertainty. The improvement in H0,
combined with WMAP7yr data, results in a constraint on the EOS parameter of
dark energy of w = -1.08 \pm 0.10 and Neff = 4.2 \pm 0.7 for the number of
relativistic species in the early universe. It also rules out the best-fitting
gigaparsec-scale void models, posited as an alternative to dark energy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3597v1,Kinematics of Gas in Lyman Alpha Nebulae,"  Exploring the origin of Ly-alpha nebulae (blobs) requires measurements of
their gas kinematics that are impossible with only the resonant,
optically-thick LyA line. To define gas motions relative to the systemic
velocity of the blob, the LyA line must be compared with an optically-thin line
like Halpha, which is not much altered by radiative transfer effects. We obtain
optical and NIR spectra of the two brightest LyA blobs from Yang et al. sample
using the Magellan/MagE and VLT/SINFONI. Both the LyA and Halpha lines confirm
that these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. Within each blob, we detect
several Halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in HST
images. The Halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internal
velocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (LAB01), their
velocity difference is ~440 km/s. The presence of multiple galaxies within the
blobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relative
motion, is consistent with our previous finding that LyA blobs inhabit massive
dark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.
To determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly
infalling or outflowing, we compare the LyA and Halpha line centers, finding
that LyA is not offset (Delta LyA = +0km/s) in LAB01 and redshifted by only
+230 km/s in LAB02. These offsets are small compared to those of Lyman break
galaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. We test and
rule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models with
super/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. Because of the
unknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiple
sources of LyA emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and more
sophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range of
infall and outflow scenarios.

models of reionization based on the initial density field of the Aquarius
parent simulation, Millennium-II, to study the impact of patchy reionization on
the faint satellite population of Milky Way halos. Because the Aquarius suite
consists of zoom-in simulations of halos in the Millennium-II volume, we follow
the formation of substructure and the growth of reionization bubbles due to the
larger environment simultaneously, and thereby determine the reionization
redshifts of satellite candidates. We do this for four different reionization
models, and also compare results to instantaneous reionization. Using a simple
procedure for selecting satellites and assigning luminosities in the
simulations, we compare the resulting satellite populations. We find that the
overall number of satellites depends sensitively on the reionization model,
with a factor of 3-4 variation between the four models for a given host halo,
although the difference is entirely in the population of faint satellites (M_V
> -10). In addition, we find that for a given reionization model the total
number of satellites differs by 10%-20% between the patchy and homogeneous
scenarios, provided that the redshift is chosen appropriately for the
instantaneous case. However, the halo-halo scatter from the six Aquarius halos
is large, up to a factor of 2-3, and so is comparable to the difference between
reionization scenarios. In order to use the population of faint dwarf galaxies
around the Milky Way as a probe of the local reionization history, then, it is
necessary to first better understand the general distribution of substructure

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0298v1,The Physics of the 'Heartbeat' State of GRS 1915+105,"  We present the first detailed phase-resolved spectral analysis of a joint
Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer and Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer observation of the rho variability class in the microquasar GRS
1915+105. The rho cycle displays a high-amplitude, double-peaked flare that
recurs roughly every 50 s, and is sometimes referred to as the ""heartbeat""
oscillation. The spectral and timing properties of the oscillation are
consistent with the radiation pressure instability and the evolution of a local
Eddington limit in the inner disk. We exploit strong variations in the X-ray
continuum, iron emission lines, and the accretion disk wind to probe the
accretion geometry over nearly six orders of magnitude in distance from the
black hole. At small scales (1-10 R_g), we detect a burst of bremsstrahlung
emission that appears to occur when a portion of the inner accretion disk
evaporates due to radiation pressure. Jet activity, as inferred from the
appearance of a short X-ray hard state, seems to be limited to times near
minimum luminosity, with a duty cycle of ~10%. On larger scales (1e5-1e6 R_g)
we use detailed photoionization arguments to track the relationship between the
fast X-ray variability and the accretion disk wind. For the first time, we are
able to show that changes in the broadband X-ray spectrum produce changes in
the structure and density of the accretion disk wind on timescales as short as
5 seconds. These results clearly establish a causal link between the X-ray
oscillations and the disk wind and therefore support the existence of a
disk-jet-wind connection. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the mass loss
rate in the wind may be sufficient to cause long-term oscillations in the
accretion rate, leading to state transitions in GRS 1915+105.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2550v1,"Constraining the Structure of Sagittarius A*'s Accretion Flow with
  Millimeter-VLBI Closure Phases","  Millimeter wave Very Long Baseline Interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides access
to the emission region surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, on sub-horizon scales. Recently, a closure
phase of 0+-40 degrees was reported on a triangle of Earth-sized baselines
(SMT-CARMA-JCMT) representing a new constraint upon the structure and
orientation of the emission region, independent from those provided by the
previously measured 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes alone. Here, we compare
this to the closure phases associated with a class of physically motivated,
radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, and present predictions for
future mm-VLBI experiments with the developing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
We find that the accretion flow models are capable of producing a wide variety
of closure phases on the SMT-CARMA-JCMT triangle, and thus not all models are
consistent with the recent observations. However, those models that reproduce
the 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes overwhelmingly have SMT-CARMA-JCMT closure
phases between +-30 degrees, and are therefore broadly consistent with all
current mm-VLBI observations. Improving station sensitivity by factors of a
few, achievable by increases in bandwidth and phasing together multiple
antennas at individual sites, should result in physically relevant additional
constraints upon the model parameters and eliminate the current 180 degree
ambiguity on the source orientation. When additional stations are included,
closure phases of order 45--90 degrees are typical. In all cases the EHT will
be able to measure these with sufficient precision to produce dramatic
improvements in the constraints upon the spin of Sgr A*.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3564v1,The Luminosity Profile and Structural Parameters of the Andromeda Galaxy,"  We have constructed an extended composite luminosity profile for the
Andromeda galaxy, M31, and have decomposed it into three basic luminous
structural components: a bulge, a disk and a halo. The dust-free Spitzer/IRAC
imaging and extended spatial coverage of ground-based optical imaging and deep
star counts allow us to map M31's structure from its center to 22 kpc along the
major axis. We apply different decomposition methods for the 1D luminosity
profiles and 2D images. These include non-linear least-squares and Bayesian
Monte-Carlo Markov-chain analyses. The basic photometric model for M31 has a
Sersic bulge with shape index n = 2.2 +/- 0.3 and effective radius R_e = 1.0
+/- 0.2 kpc, a dust-free exponential disk of scale length R_d = 5.3 +/- 0.5
kpc; the parameter errors reflect the range between various decomposition
methods. The bulge parameter, n, is rather insensitive to bandpass effects and
its value suggests a first rapid formation via mergers followed by secular
growth from the disk. The M31 halo has a 2D power-law index ~ -2.5 +/- 0.2. We
find that the M31 bulge light is mostly dominant over the range R_minor < 1.2
kpc. The disk takes over in the range 1.2 kpc < R_minor < 9 kpc, whereas the
halo dominates at R_minor > 9 kpc. The stellar nucleus, bulge, disk, and halo
components each contribute roughly 0.05%, 23%, 73% and 4% of the total light of
M31 out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. Nominal errors for the structural
parameters of the M31 bulge, disk and halo amount to 20%. If M31 and the Milky
Way are at all typical, faint stellar halos should be routinely detected in
galaxy surveys reaching below mu_i ~ 27 mag/arcsec^2. We stress that our
results rely on this photometric analysis alone. Structural parameters may
change when other fundamental constraints, such as those provided by abundance
gradients and stellar kinematics, are considered simultaneously (Abridged).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1281v2,Moving mesh cosmology: numerical techniques and global statistics,"  We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation using
the new moving mesh code AREPO and compare the results with GADGET simulations
based on a traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The two
codes share the same Tree-PM gravity solver and include identical
sub-resolution physics, but employ different methods to solve the equations of
hydrodynamics. This allows us to assess the impact of hydro-solver
uncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. We
focus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic star
formation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numerical
methods. Properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by Keres et
al. (2011), while a third paper by Sijacki et al. (2011) uses idealised
simulations to analyse the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. We
find that the global baryon statistics differ significantly between the two
simulation approaches. AREPO shows higher star formation rates at late times,
lower mean temperatures, and different gas mass fractions in characteristic
phases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas.
Although both codes use the same implementation of cooling, more gas cools out
of haloes in AREPO compared with GADGET towards low redshifts. We show that
this is caused by a higher heating rate with SPH in the outer parts of haloes,
owing to viscous dissipation of SPH's inherent sonic velocity noise and SPH's
efficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region,
and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in AREPO. As a result of
such differences, AREPO leads also to more disk-like morphologies compared to
GADGET. Our results indicate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can lead
to comparatively large systematic differences.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1831v1,CO and H2 Absorption in the AA Tauri Circumstellar Disk,"  The direct study of molecular gas in inner protoplanetary disks is
complicated by uncertainties in the spatial distribution of the gas, the
time-variability of the source, and the comparison of observations across a
wide range of wavelengths. Some of these challenges can be mitigated with
far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. Using new observations obtained with the
HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, we measure column densities and rovibrational
temperatures for CO and H2 observed on the line-of-sight through the AA Tauri
circumstellar disk. CO A-X absorption bands are observed against the far-UV
continuum. The CO absorption is characterized by log(N(^{12}CO)) = 17.5 +/- 0.5
cm^{-2} and T_rot(CO) = 500$^{+500}_{-200} K, although this rotational
temperature may underestimate the local kinetic temperature of the CO-bearing
gas. We also detect ^{13}CO in absorption with an isotopic ratio of ~20. We do
not observe H2 absorption against the continuum; however, hot H2 (v > 0) is
detected in absorption against the LyA emission line. We measure the column
densities in eight individual rovibrational states, determining a total
log(N(H2)) = 17.9^{+0.6}_{-0.3} cm^{-2} with a thermal temperature of T(H2) =
2500^{+800}_{-700} K. The high-temperature of the molecules, the relatively
small H2 column density, and the high-inclination of the AA Tauri disk suggest
that the absorbing gas resides in an inner disk atmosphere. If the H2 and CO
are co-spatial within a molecular layer ~ 0.6 AU thick, this region is
characterized by <n_H2> ~ 10^{5} cm^{-3} with an observed <CO/H2> ratio of ~
0.4. We also find evidence for a departure from a purely thermal H2
distribution, suggesting that excitation by continuum photons and H2 formation
may be altering the level populations in the molecular gas.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3468v2,Moving mesh cosmology: the hydrodynamics of galaxy formation,"  We present a detailed comparison between the well-known SPH code GADGET and
the new moving-mesh code AREPO on a number of hydrodynamical test problems.
Through a variety of numerical experiments we establish a clear link between
test problems and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in
several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in
idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation
setups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting gas properties in the full
cosmological framework, as highlighted in papers by Vogelsberger et al. (2011)
and Keres et al. (2011). We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid
instabilities in GADGET suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates
vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from
infalling substructures. In idealized tests of inside-out disk formation, the
convergence rate of gas disk sizes is much slower in GADGET due to spurious
angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction
between a forming central disk and orbiting substructures in a halo, the final
disk morphology is strikingly different. In AREPO, gas from infalling
substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo
atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disk. Conversely,
gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in GADGET simulations, morphologically
transforming the disk as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH
solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably
affect cosmological simulations due to their hierarchical nature. Our numerical
experiments clearly demonstrate that AREPO delivers a physically more reliable
solution.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4638v2,Moving mesh cosmology: characteristics of galaxies and haloes,"  We discuss cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation
performed with the new moving-mesh code AREPO, which promises higher accuracy
compared with the traditional SPH technique that has been widely employed for
this problem. We use an identical set of physics in corresponding simulations
carried out with the well-tested SPH code GADGET, adopting also the same
high-resolution gravity solver. We are thus able to compare both simulation
sets on an object-by-object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact of
different hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. In accompanying
papers, we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted by
the simulation codes, (Vogelsberger et al. 2011) and complementary idealized
simulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes
(Sijacki et al. 2011). Here we investigate their influence on the baryonic
properties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. We find that
AREPO leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies in
massive haloes and to more extended gaseous disks in galaxies, which also
feature a thinner and smoother morphology than their GADGET counterparts.
Consequently, galaxies formed in AREPO have larger sizes and higher specific
angular momentum than their SPH correspondents. The more efficient cooling
flows in AREPO yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centers (and
the opposite trend in halo outskirts) leading to higher star formation rates of
massive galaxies. While both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number of
baryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results clearly demonstrate that
galaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accurate
hydrodynamical techniques such as AREPO.

black holes masses coupled with libraries of host galaxy velocity dispersions,
rotational velocities and photometric parameters extracted from Sloan Digital
Sky Survey i-band images to establish correlations between the SMBH and host
galaxy parameters. We test whether the mass of the black hole, MBH, is
fundamentally driven by either local or global galaxy properties. We explore
correlations between MBH and stellar velocity dispersion sigma, bulge
luminosity, bulge mass Sersic index, bulge mean effective surface brightness,
luminosity of the galaxy, galaxy stellar mass, maximum circular velocity Vc,
galaxy dynamical and effective masses. We verify the tightness of the MBH-sigma
relation and find that correlations with other galaxy parameters do not yield
tighter trends. We do not find differences in the MBH-sigma relation of barred
and unbarred galaxies. The MBH-sigma relation of pseudo-bulges is also coarser
and has a different slope than that involving classical bulges. The MBH-bulge
mass is not as tight as the MBH-sigma relation, despite the bulge mass proving
to be a better proxy of MBH than bulge luminosity. We find a rather poor
correlation between MBH and Sersic index suggesting that MBH is not related to
the bulge light concentration. The correlations between MBH and galaxy
luminosity or mass are not a marked improvement over the MBH sigma relation. If
Vc is a proxy for the dark matter halo mass, the large scatter of the MBH-Vc
relation then suggests that MBH is more coupled to the baryonic rather than the
dark matter. We have tested the need for a third parameter in the MBH scaling
relations, through various linear correlations with bulge and galaxy
parameters, only to confirm that the fundamental plane of the SMBH is mainly
driven by sigma, with a small tilt due to the effective radius. (Abridged)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3791v2,"A General Model for the CO-H2 Conversion Factor in Galaxies with
  Applications to the Star Formation Law","  The most common means of converting an observed CO line intensity into a
molecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (Xco). While in the
Milky Way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is good
reason to believe that Xco will depend on the larger-scale galactic
environment. Utilising numerical models, we investigate how varying
metallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impact the
way CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under what
circumstances Xco may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due to
the combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, Xco
is depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments such
as ULIRGs. In contrast, in low metallicity environments, Xco tends to be higher
than in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal-poor clouds. At
higher redshifts, gas-rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps which
are warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocity
dispersions. These discs tend to have Xco values ranging between present-epoch
gas-rich mergers and quiescent discs at low-z. This model shows that on
average, mergers do have lower Xco values than disc galaxies, though there is
significant overlap. Xco varies smoothly with the local conditions within a
galaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine our
results to provide a general fitting formula for Xco as a function of CO line
intensity and metallicity. We show that replacing the traditional approach of
using one constant Xco for starbursts and another for discs with our best-fit

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4600v2,Detection of the Water Reservoir in a Forming Planetary System,"  Icy bodies may have delivered the oceans to the early Earth, yet little is
known about water in the ice-dominated regions of extra-solar planet-forming
disks. The Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared on-board the Herschel
Space Observatory has detected emission from both spin isomers of cold water
vapor from the disk around the young star TW Hydrae. This water vapor likely
originates from ice-coated solids near the disk surface hinting at a water ice
reservoir equivalent to several thousand Earth Oceans in mass. The water's
ortho-to-para ratio falls well below that of Solar System comets, suggesting
that comets contain heterogeneous ice mixtures collected across the entire
solar nebula during the early stages of planetary birth.

  Eridani (2009)","  Context. Nova Eridani (2009) caught the eye of the nova community due to its
fast decline from maximum, which was initially missed, and its subsequent
development in the radio and X-ray wavelengths. This system also exhibits
properties similar to those of the much smaller class of recurrent novae;
themselves potential progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae. Aims. We aim to
determine the nature and physical parameters of the KT Eri progenitor system.
Methods. We searched the Harvard College Observatory archive plates for the
progenitor of KT Eri to determine the nature of the system, particularly the
evolutionary stage of the secondary.We used the data obtained to search for any
periodic signal and the derived luminosity to estimate a recurrence timescale.
Furthermore, by comparing the colours of the quiescent system on a
colour-magnitude diagram we may infer the nature of the secondary star.
Results. We identified the progenitor system of KT Eri and measured a quiescent
magnitude of < B >= 14.7 \pm 0.4. No previous outburst was found. However, we
suggest that if the nova is recurrent it should be on a timescale of centuries.
We find a periodicity at quiescence of 737 days which may arise from reflection
effects and/or eclipses in the central binary. The periodicity and the
quiescence magnitude of the system suggest that the secondary star is evolved
and likely in, or ascending, the Red Giant Branch. A second period is evident
at 376 days which has a sinusoidal like light curve. Furthermore, the outburst
amplitude of ~ 9 magnitudes is inconsistent with those expected for fast
classical novae (~ 17 magnitudes) which may lend further support for an evolved
secondary. (Abridged)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5635v2,Moving Mesh Cosmology: Properties of Gas Disks,"  We compare the structural properties of galaxies formed in cosmological
simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET with
those using the moving-mesh code AREPO. Both codes employ identical gravity
solvers and the same sub-resolution physics but use very different methods to
track the hydrodynamic evolution of gas. This permits us to isolate the effects
of the hydro solver on the formation and evolution of galactic gas disks in
GADGET and AREPO haloes with comparable numerical resolution. In a matching
sample of GADGET and AREPO haloes we fit simulated gas disks with exponential
profiles. We find that the cold gas disks formed using the moving mesh approach
have systematically larger disk scale lengths and higher specific angular
momenta than their GADGET counterparts across a wide range in halo masses. For
low mass galaxies differences between the properties of the simulated galaxy
disks are caused by an insufficient number of resolution elements which lead to
the artificial angular momentum transfer in our SPH calculation. We however
find that galactic disks formed in massive halos, resolved with 10^6
particles/cells, are still systematically smaller in the GADGET run by a factor
of ~2. The reasons for this are: 1) The excessive heating of haloes close to
the cooling radius due to spurious dissipation of the subsonic turbulence in
GADGET; and 2) The efficient delivery of low angular momentum gaseous blobs to
the bottom of the potential well. While this large population of gaseous blobs
in GADGET originates from the filaments which are pressure confined and
fragment due to the SPH surface tension while infalling into hot halo
atmospheres, it is essentially absent in the moving mesh calculation, clearly
indicating numerical rather than physical origin of the blob material.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2877v2,The X-ray Counterpart of the High-B Pulsar PSR J0726-2612,"  Middle-aged, cooling neutron stars are observed both as relatively rapidly
spinning radio pulsars and as more slowly spinning, strongly magnetized
isolated neutron stars (INSs), which stand out by their thermal X-ray spectra.
The difference between the two classes may be that the INSs initially had much
stronger magnetic fields, which decayed. To test this, we used the Chandra
X-ray Observatory to observe 1RXS J072559.8-261229, a possible X-ray
counterpart to PSR J0726-2612, which, with its 3.44s period and 3e13G inferred
magnetic field strength, is the nearest and least extincted among the possible
slowly-spinning, strong-field INS progenitors (it likely is in the Gould Belt,
at ~1 kpc). We confirm the identification and find that the pulsar has a
spectrum consistent with being purely thermal, with blackbody temperature
kT=87+/-5 eV and radius R=5.7+2.6-1.3 km at a distance of 1 kpc. We detect
sinusoidal pulsations at twice the radio period with a semi-amplitude of
27\pm5%. The properties of PSR J0726-2612 strongly resemble those of the INSs,
except for its much shorter characteristic age of 200 kyr (instead of several
Myr). We conclude that PSR J0726-2612 is indeed an example of a young INS, one
that started with a magnetic field strength on the low end of those inferred
for the INSs, and that, therefore, decayed by a relatively small amount. Our
results suggest that the long-period, strong-field pulsars and the INSs are
members of the same class, and open up new opportunities to understand the
puzzling X-ray and optical emission of the INSs through radio observations of
PSR J0726-2612.

from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 and available galaxy
rotational velocities derived from HI line widths. We compare the data products
provided through the SDSS imaging pipeline with our own photometry of the SDSS

galaxy sizes (R) and luminosities (L). Our radial and luminosity parameters
improve upon the SDSS DR7 Petrosian radii and luminosities through the use of
isophotal fits to the galaxy images. This improvement is gauged via VL and RV
relations whose respective scatters are reduced by ~8% and ~30% compared to
similar relations built with SDSS parameters. The tightest VRL relations are
obtained with the i-band radius, R235i, measured at 23.5 mag/arcsec^-2, and the
luminosity L235i, measured within R235i. Our VRL scaling relations compare
well, both in scatter and slope, with similar studies (such comparisons however
depend sensitively on the nature and size of the compared samples). The typical
slopes, b, and observed scatters, sigma, of the i-band VL, RL and RV relations
are bVL=0.27+/-0.01, bRL=0.41+/-0.01, bRV=1.52+/-0.07, and sigmaVL=0.074,

Empirical calibrations of the data also lead to accurate mass and radius
estimates for exoplanet host stars. Finally, accurate data for unusual stellar

with similar normal stars. METHODS: Accurate radial velocities from the Digital

with previously published uvby photometry to determine precise physical
parameters for the four stars. A detailed abundance analysis was performed from
high-resolution spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma).
RESULTS: We find the masses of the (relatively evolved) stars in SW CMa to be
2.10 and 2.24 solar masses, with radii of 2.50 and 3.01 solar radii, while the

probe and provide a key testing ground for structure formation theory. Focusing
on their mass profiles, we have carried out (gravity-only) simulations of the
concordance LCDM cosmology, covering a mass range of 2.10^{12}-2.10^{15} solar
mass/h and a redshift range of z=0-2, while satisfying the associated
requirements of resolution and statistical control. When fitting to the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our concentration-mass (c-M) relation differs in
normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited
statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of
the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a
function of the peak height parameter, \nu. Unlike the c-M relation, the slope
of the c-\nu relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z=0-2,
while the amplitude varies by ~30% for massive clusters. This relation is,
however, not universal: Using a simulation suite covering the allowed wCDM
parameter space, we show that the c-\nu relation varies by about +/- 20% as
cosmological parameters are varied. At fixed mass, the c(M) distribution is
well-fit by a Gaussian with \sigma_c/c = 0.33, independent of the radius at
which the concentration is defined, the halo dynamical state, and the
underlying cosmology. We compare the LCDM predictions with observations of halo
concentrations from strong lensing, weak lensing, galaxy kinematics, and X-ray
data, finding good agreement for massive clusters (M > 4.10^{14} solar mass/h),
but with some disagreements at lower masses. Because of uncertainty in
observational systematics and modeling of baryonic physics, the significance of
these discrepancies remains unclear.

  and Implications for Magellanic Irregulars","  We present a novel pair of numerical models of the interaction history
between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) and
our Milky Way (MW) in light of recent high precision proper motions
(Kallivayalil et al. 2006a,b). Given the new velocities, cosmological
simulations of structure formation favor a scenario where the Magellanic Clouds
(MCs) are currently on their first infall towards our Galaxy (Boylan-Kolchin et
al. 2011, Busha et al. 2011). We illustrate here that the observed irregular
morphology and internal kinematics of the MCs (in gas and stars) are naturally
explained by interactions between the LMC and SMC, rather than gravitational
interactions with the MW. This picture further supports a first infall scenario
(Besla et a. 2007). In particular, we demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a
band of HI gas trailing behind the MCs 150 degrees across the sky, can be
accounted for by the action of LMC tides on the SMC before the system was
accreted by the MW. We further demonstrate that the off-center, warped stellar
bar of the LMC and its one-armed spiral, can be naturally explained by a recent
direct collision with the SMC. Such structures are key morphological
characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to as Magellanic Irregulars (de
Vaucouleurs & Freeman 1972), the majority of which are not associated with
massive spiral galaxies. We infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions are
important drivers for the morphological evolution of Magellanic Irregulars and
can dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxies
via the formation of extended tidal bridges and tails. Such interactions are
important not only for the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have direct
consequences for the buildup of baryons in our own MW, as LMC-mass systems are
believed to be the dominant building blocks of MW-type halos.

cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated
by some form of ""dark energy"" with exotic physical properties, or that
Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound
implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental
efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with
percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well
established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters.
We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques
and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ""Stage
IV"" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We
briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space
distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H_0. We
present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of
state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage
IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and
CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to
provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We
emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most
powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties
and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic
acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the
longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater
detail over ever larger scales.

models, which do not violate any astrophysical constraints due to a
non-power-law velocity dependence of the transfer cross section which is
motivated by a Yukawa-like new gauge boson interaction. Specifically, we focus
on the formation of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo taken from the Aquarius
project and re-simulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowed
parameter space of this new model. We find that for these cases, the main halo
only develops a small core (~1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical to
that of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. Neither
the subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes are
altered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner density
structure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. As a
consequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloes
differ significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstrate
that they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest Milky Way
dSphs in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario.
Specifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloes
that are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of the
Milky Way dSphs. We conclude that these models offer an interesting alternative
to the cold dark matter model that can reduce the recently reported tension
between the brightest Milky Way satellites and the dense subhaloes found in
cold dark matter simulations.

luminosity of L(2-10 keV) ~ (5.08 +/-0.52) 10^43 erg/s characteristic of Type 2
AGN. Regions of soft (<2 keV) X-ray emission that trace the hot interstellar
medium (ISM) are correlated with radio structures along the main radio axis
indicating a strong relation between the two. The X-ray emission beyond the
radio source correlates with the morphology of optical line-emitting regions.
We measured the ISM temperature in several regions across the galaxy to be kT ~
0.5 with slightly higher temperatures (of a few keV) in the center and in the
vicinity of the radio hotspots. Assuming these regions were heated by weak
shocks driven by the expanding radio source, we estimated the corresponding
Mach number of 1.6 in the southern regions. The thermal pressure of the X-ray
emitting gas in the outermost regions suggest the hot ISM is slightly
under-pressured with respect to the cold optical-line emitting gas and
radio-emitting plasma, which both seem to be in a rough pressure equilibrium.
We conclude that 4C+29.30 displays a complex view of interactions between the
jet-driven radio outflow and host galaxy environment, signaling feedback
processes closely associated with the central active nucleus.

  associated with infrared bubbles","  The Milky Way Project citizen science initiative recently increased the
number of known infrared bubbles in the inner Galactic plane by an order of
magnitude compared to previous studies. We present a detailed statistical
analysis of this dataset with the Red MSX Source catalog of massive young
stellar sources to investigate the association of these bubbles with massive
star formation. We particularly address the question of massive triggered star
formation near infrared bubbles. We find a strong positional correlation of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and H II regions with Milky Way Project
bubbles at separations of < 2 bubble radii. As bubble sizes increase, a
statistically significant overdensity of massive young sources emerges in the
region of the bubble rims, possibly indicating the occurrence of triggered star
formation. Based on numbers of bubble-associated RMS sources we find that
67+/-3% of MYSOs and (ultra)compact H II regions appear associated with a
bubble. We estimate that approximately 22+/-2% of massive young stars may have
formed as a result of feedback from expanding H II regions. Using MYSO-bubble
correlations, we serendipitously recovered the location of the recently
discovered massive cluster Mercer 81, suggesting the potential of such analyses
for discovery of heavily extincted distant clusters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6203v2,The cold veil of the Milky Way stellar halo,"  We build a sample of distant (D > 80 kpc) stellar halo stars with measured
radial velocities. Faint ($20 < g <22$) candidate blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars were selected using the deep, but wide, multi-epoch Sloan Digital Sky
Survey photometry. Follow-up spectroscopy for these A-type stars was performed
using the VLT-FORS2 instrument. We classify stars according to their Balmer
line profiles, and find 7 are bona fide BHB stars and 31 are blue stragglers
(BS). Owing to the magnitude range of our sample, even the intrinsically
fainter BS stars can reach out to D ~ 90 kpc. We complement this sample of
A-type stars with intrinsically brighter, intermediate-age, asymptotic giant
branch stars. A set of 4 distant cool carbon stars is compiled from the
literature and we perform spectroscopic follow-up on a further 4 N-type carbon
stars using the WHT-ISIS instrument. Altogether, this provides us with the
largest sample to date of individual star tracers out to r ~ 150 kpc. We find
that the radial velocity dispersion of these tracers falls rapidly at large
distances and is surprisingly cold (sigma_r ~ 50-60 km/s) between 100-150 kpc.
Relating the measured radial velocities to the mass of the Milky Way requires
knowledge of the (unknown) tracer density profile and anisotropy at these
distances. Nonetheless, by assuming the stellar halo stars between 50-150 kpc
have a moderate density fall-off (with power-law slope alpha < 5) and are on
radial orbits (sigma^2_t/sigma^2_r < 1), we infer that the mass within 150 kpc
is less than 10^12 M_solar and suggest it probably lies in the range (5-10) x
10^11 M_solar. We discuss the implications of such a low mass for the Milky
Way.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0011v2,"Star Formation in Galaxy Mergers with Realistic Models of Stellar
  Feedback & the Interstellar Medium","  We use simulations with realistic models for stellar feedback to study galaxy
mergers. These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and
destruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is
dominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to
global torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.
The gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and
subsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast
to some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the
central bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of
the galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several
percent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus
does so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a
consequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the
small-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this
relation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR
photons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the
most extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives
super-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind
material falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher
post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is
required to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. We compare the
predicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disk
survival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve GMCs or feedback.
Global galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and star
formation rates can differ significantly.

per source. These provide soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) spectra and sub-arcsecond
localizations, which we use to identify counterparts at other wavelengths,
providing information about the nature of each source. Despite the fact that
all of the sources are within 5 degrees of the plane, four of the IGR sources
are AGN (IGR J01545+6437, IGR J15391-5307, IGR J15415-5029, and IGR
J21565+5948) and four others are likely AGN (IGR J03103+5706, IGR J09189-4418,
IGR J16413-4046, and IGR J16560-4958) based on each of them having a strong IR
excess and/or extended optical or near-IR emission. We compare the X-ray and
near-IR fluxes of this group of sources to those of AGN selected by their 2-10

Galactic (IGR J12489-6243, IGR J15293-5609, IGR J16173-5023, and IGR
J16206-5253), but only IGR J15293-5609 is confirmed as a Galactic source as it
has a unique Chandra counterpart and a parallax measurement from previous
optical observations that puts its distance at 1.56+/-0.12 kpc. The 0.3-10 keV
luminosity for this source is 1.4e32 erg/s, and its optical/IR spectral energy
distribution is well described by a blackbody with a temperature of 4200-7000 K
and a radius of 12.0-16.4 Rsun. These values suggest that IGR J15293-5609 is a
symbiotic binary with an early K-type giant and a white dwarf accretor. We also
obtained likely Chandra identifications for IGR J13402-6428 and IGR

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5769v1,A Fokker-Planck Study of Dense Rotating Stellar Clusters,"  The dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems is simulated using a
two-dimensional Fokker-Planck method, with the goal of providing a model for
the formation of supermassive stars which could serve as seed objects for the
supermassive black holes of quasars. This work follows and expands on earlier
1-D studies of spherical clusters of main-sequence stars. The 2-D approach
allows for the study of rotating systems, as would be expected due to
cosmological tidal torquing; other physical effects included are collisional
mergers of stars and a bulk stellar bar perturbation in the gravitational
potential. The 3 Myr main-sequence lifetime for large stars provides an upper
limit on simulation times. Two general classes of initial systems are studied:
Plummer spheres, which represent stellar clusters, and \gamma=0 spheres, which
model galactic spheroids.
  At the initial densities of the modeled systems, mass segregation and runaway
stellar collisions alone are insufficient to induce core collapse within the
lifetime limit if no bar perturbation is included. However, core collapse is
not a requirement for the formation of a massive object: the choice of stellar
initial mass function is found to play a crucial role. When using an IMF
similar to that observed for dense stellar clusters the simulations show that
the stellar system forms massive (250M_\odot) objects by collisional mergers;
in almost all such cases the presence of a stellar bar allows for sufficient
additional outward transport of angular momentum that a core-collapse state is
reached with corresponding further increase in the rate of formation of massive
objects. In contrast, simulations using an IMF similar to that observed for
field stars in general (which is weighted more towards lower masses) produce no
massive objects, and reach core collapse only for initial models which
represent the highest-density galactic spheriods.

  dimensions","  The physics of the pseudogap state is intimately linked with the pairing
mechanism that gives rise to superfluidity in quantum gases and to
superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, and therefore, both in quantum gases and
superconductors, the pseudogap state and preformed pairs have been under
intensive experimental scrutiny. Here, we develop a path integral treatment
that provides a divergence-free description of the paired state in
two-dimensional Fermi gases. Within this formalism, we derive the pseudogap
temperature and the pair fluctuation spectral function, and compare these
results with the recent experimental measument of the pairing in the
two-dimensional Fermi gas. The removal of the infrared divergence in the number
equations is shown both numerically and analytically, through a study of the
long-wavelength and low-energy limit of the pair fluctuation density. Besides
the pseudogap temperature, also the pair formation temperature and the critical
temperature for superfluidity are derived. The latter corresponds to the
Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. The pseudogap temperature,
which coincides with the pair formation temperature in mean field, is found to
be suppressed with respect to the pair formation temperature by fluctuations.
This suppression is strongest for large binding energies of the pairs. Finally,
we investigate how the pair formation temperature, the pseudogap temperature
and the BKT temperature behave as a function of both binding energy and
imbalance between the pairing partners in the Fermi gas. This allows to set up
phase diagrams for the two-dimensional Fermi gas, in which the superfluid
phase, the phase-fluctuating quasicondensate, and the normal state can be
identified.

Observations of the spatial distribution and lifetime of the molecular gas at

far-ultraviolet spectra from the COS and STIS instruments on the Hubble Space
Telescope to sample 34 T Tauri stars (27 actively accreting CTTSs and 7

sources, including all of the transitional disks in our sample (CS Cha, DM Tau,
GM Aur, UX Tau A, LkCa15, HD 135344B and TW Hya). The spatial distribution of
the emitting gas is inferred from spectrally resolved H2 line profiles. Some of
the emitting gas is produced in outflowing material, but the majority of H2
emission appears to originate in a rotating disk. For the disk-dominated
targets, the H2 emission originates predominately at r < 3 AU. The emission
line-widths and inner molecular radii are found to be roughly consistent with
those measured from mid-IR CO spectra.

four of the five globular clusters (GCs) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy
are very metal-poor with [Fe/H]<-2. The remaining cluster, Fornax 4, has
[Fe/H]=-1.4. This is in stark contrast to the field star metallicity
distribution which shows a broad peak around [Fe/H]=-1 with only a few percent
of the stars having [Fe/H]<-2. If we only consider stars and clusters with
[Fe/H]<-2 we thus find an extremely high GC specific frequency, SN=400,
implying by far the highest ratio of GCs to field stars known anywhere. We
estimate that about 1/5-1/4 of all stars in the Fornax dSph with [Fe/H]<-2
belong to the four most metal-poor GCs. These GCs could, therefore, at most
have been a factor of 4-5 more massive initially. Yet, the Fornax GCs appear to
share the same anomalous chemical abundance patterns known from Milky Way GCs,
commonly attributed to the presence of multiple stellar generations within the
clusters. The extreme ratio of metal-poor GC- versus field stars in the Fornax
dSph is difficult to reconcile with scenarios for self-enrichment and early
evolution of GCs in which a large fraction (90%-95%) of the first-generation
stars have been lost. It also suggests that the GCs may not have formed as part
of a larger population of now disrupted clusters with an initial power-law mass

Spectra of the Sun and of asteroids pin the zero-point of our velocities,
yielding a velocity accuracy of 0.01 km/s for G2V stars. This velocity
zero-point agrees within 0.01 \kms with the zero-points carefully determined by
Nidever et al. (2002) and Latham et al. (2002). For reference we compute the
differences in velocity zero-points between our velocities and standard stars
of the IAU, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and l'Observatoire
de Geneve, finding agreement with all of them at the level of 0.1 km/s. But our
radial velocities (and those of all other groups) contain no corrections for
convective blueshift or gravitational redshifts (except for G2V stars), leaving
them vulnerable to systematic errors of 0.2 \kms for K dwarfs and ~0.3 km/s for
M dwarfs due to subphotospheric convection, for which we offer velocity
corrections. The velocities here thus represent accurately the radial component

http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1377v2,Direct detection of self-interacting dark matter,"  Self-interacting dark matter offers an interesting alternative to
collisionless dark matter because of its ability to preserve the large-scale
success of the cold dark matter model, while seemingly solving its challenges
on small scales. We present here the first study of the expected dark matter
detection signal taking into account different self-scattering models. We
demonstrate that models with constant and velocity dependent cross sections,
which are consistent with observational constraints, lead to distinct
signatures in the velocity distribution, because non-thermalised features found
in the cold dark matter distribution are thermalised through particle
scattering. Depending on the model, self-interaction can lead to a 10%
reduction of the recoil rates at high energies, corresponding to a minimum
speed that can cause recoil larger than 300 km/s, compared to the cold dark
matter case. At lower energies these differences are smaller than 5% for all
models. The amplitude of the annual modulation signal can increase by up to
25%, and the day of maximum amplitude can shift by about two weeks with respect
to the cold dark matter expectation. Furthermore, the exact day of phase
reversal of the modulation signal can also differ by about a week between the
different models. In general, models with velocity dependent cross sections
peaking at the typical velocities of dwarf galaxies lead only to minor changes
in the detection signals, whereas allowed constant cross section models lead to
significant changes. We conclude that different self-interacting dark matter
scenarios might be distinguished from each other through the details of direct
detection signals. Furthermore, detailed constraints on the intrinsic
properties of dark matter based on null detections, should take into account
the possibility of self-scattering and the resulting effects on the detector
signal.

polarization (on large angular scales) CMB anisotropies induced during the
epoch of reionization (EoR). Using a novel method calibrated from
Radiation-Hydrodynamic simulations we model the EoR in large volumes (L >~ 2
Gpc/h) in the context of galactic reionization. We find that the EoR
contribution to the kinetic Sunyaev- Zel'dovich power spectrum (patchy kSZ)
ranges between ~0.6 - 2.8 muK^2 at ell = 3000, for the parameter space we
explored. These patchy kSZ power spectra are calculated from large 15 Deg x 15
Deg maps that are found to be necessary. Decreasing the size of these maps
biases the overall patchy kSZ power to higher values. We find that the
amplitude of the patchy kSZ power spectrum at ell = 3000 follows simple
scalings of D_ell=3000^kSZ propto <z> and D_ell=3000^kSZ propto Delz^0.47 for
the mean redshift (<z>) of reionization and the duration (dz). Using the
constraints on <z> from WMAP 7-year results and the lower limit on dz from
EDGES we find a lower limit of ~ 0.4 muK^2 on the kSZ at ell = 3000. Planck
will constrain the mean redshift and the Thomson optical depth from the low-ell
polarization power spectrum. Future measurements of the high-ell CMB power
spectrum from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) should detect the patchy kSZ signal if the cross correlation
between the cosmic infrared background and the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich
effect is constrained. We show that the combination of temperature and
polarization measurements constrains both <z> and dz. The patchy kSZ maps,
power spectra templates and the polarization power spectra will be publicly
available.

  cluster as a measure for the effective ICM viscosity","  Sloshing cold fronts (CFs) arise from minor merger triggered gas sloshing.
Their detailed structure depends on the properties of the intra-cluster medium
(ICM): hydrodynamical simulations predict the CFs to be distorted by
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs), but aligned magnetic fields, viscosity,
or thermal conduction can suppress the KHIs. Thus, observing the detailed
structure of sloshing CFs can be used to constrain these ICM properties. Both
smooth and distorted sloshing CFs have been observed, indicating that the KHI
is suppressed in some clusters, but not in all. Consequently, we need to
address at least some sloshing clusters individually before drawing general
conclusions about the ICM properties. We present the first detailed attempt to
constrain the ICM properties in a specific cluster from the structure of its
sloshing CF. Proximity and brightness make the Virgo cluster an ideal target.
We combine observations and Virgo-specific hydrodynamical sloshing simulations.
Here we focus on a Spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity as a mechanism
to suppress the KHI, but discuss the alternative mechanisms in detail. We
identify the CF at 90 kpc north and north-east of the Virgo center as the best
location in the cluster to observe a possible KHI suppression. For viscosities
$\gtrsim$ 10% of the Spitzer value KHIs at this CF are suppressed. We describe
in detail the observable signatures at low and high viscosities, i.e. in the
presence or absence of KHIs. We find indications for a low ICM viscosity in
archival XMM-Newton data and demonstrate the detectability of the predicted
features in deep Chandra observations.

  functions for mono-abundance stellar populations","  We present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the Galactic
potential based on the phase-space information for many individual stars. Such
an approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic
surveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes the orbit
distribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)
proposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these
parametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space
distributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars
(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which
enables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic
mono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to
constrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint
likelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over
the DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection
function inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the
uncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,
we study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be
reached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By
creating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and
realistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitational
potential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with
sample sizes of a few thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that
are smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitations
in our current study.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0841v2,Resolving The Generation of Starburst Winds in Galaxy Mergers,"  We study galaxy super-winds driven in major mergers, using pc-resolution
simulations with detailed models for stellar feedback that can
self-consistently follow the formation/destruction of GMCs and generation of
winds. The models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densities
in GMCs, and gas recycling and feedback from SNe (I&II), stellar winds, and
radiation pressure. We study mergers of systems from SMC-like dwarfs and Milky
Way analogues to z~2 starburst disks. Multi-phase super-winds are generated in
all passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 M_sun/yr. However, the wind
mass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by SFR) is similar to that in
isolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy
properties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of the
merger. Winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build up
complex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at a
range of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with
material at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,
ionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedback
mechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,
where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced
starbursts. But despite large mass-loading factors (>~10) in the winds, the
peak SFRs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations. Wind acceleration
does not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum and
form stars, while blowing out gas that would not have participated in the
starburst in the first place. Considerable wind material is not unbound, and
falls back on the disk at later times post-merger, leading to higher
post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. This may require AGN
feedback to explain galaxy quenching.

multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism
MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From
PRIMUS we construct an i<23 flux-limited sample of ~40,000 galaxies at
z=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ~5.5 deg^2, and from the SDSS we select
~170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to
PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find
that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we
do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ~30% increase in
the number density of ~10^10 Msun galaxies since z~0.6, and a <10% change in
the number density of all >10^11 Msun galaxies since z~1. Dividing the sample
into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific
star-formation rate, we find that the number density of ~10^10 Msun
star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z~0.6, whereas the
space-density of >10^11 Msun star-forming galaxies decreases by ~50% between
z~1 and z~0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~10^10 Msun quiescent galaxies
increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z~0.6, while
the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since
z~1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are
quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the
stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~10^10.8
Msun. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant
channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z<1, even among massive
(>10^11 Msun) quiescent galaxies.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6753v1,Moving mesh cosmology: tracing cosmological gas accretion,"  We investigate the nature of gas accretion onto haloes and galaxies at z=2
using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code
AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the
origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative
comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches,
we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of
accreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous
work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming
in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats
to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same
galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11
solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same
halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold
accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive
systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard
formulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from
cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is a
consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value
independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of
accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated
and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large
number of purely numerical ""blobs"". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased
heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas
accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2913v3,A model for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation physics,"  We present a new comprehensive model of the physics of galaxy formation
designed for large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation
using the moving mesh code AREPO. Our model includes primordial and metal line
cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution and feedback
processes, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, a novel subgrid model for the
metal loading of outflows, black hole (BH) seeding, BH growth and merging
procedures, quasar- and radio-mode feedback, and a prescription for radiative
electro-magnetic (EM) feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The metal
mass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind mass
loading. This is required to simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content
of low mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. Radiative EM AGN feedback
is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a
luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback
suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode
feedback alone, but is less efficient than mechanical radio-mode feedback in
regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions
for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations. Our
best match model reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation
history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass - halo mass relation, g-,
r-, i-, z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher relation.
We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and
AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low and
high mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to
be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient
cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.

mass of the disk is estimated to be 0.007 M_sun, assuming optically thin,
isothermal dust emission. The millimeter spectral index is observed to be quite
shallow at all the spatial scales probed; alpha ~ 2, implying a dust opacity
spectral index beta ~ 0. We model the emission from the disk and surrounding
envelope using Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes, simultaneously fitting the
sub/millimeter visibility amplitudes, sub/millimeter images, resolved L\arcmin\
image, spectral energy distribution, and mid-infrared spectrum. The best
fitting model has a disk radius of R = 125 AU, is highly flared (H ~ R^1.3),
has a radial density profile rho ~ R^-2.5, and has a mass of 0.0075 M_sun. The
scale height at 100 AU is 48 AU, about a factor of two greater than vertical
hydrostatic equilibrium. The resolved millimeter observations indicate that
disks may grow rapidly throughout the Class 0 phase. The mass and radius of the
young disk around L1527 is comparable to disks around pre-main sequence stars;
however, the disk is considerably more vertically extended, possibly due to a
combination of lower protostellar mass, infall onto the disk upper layers, and
little settling of ~1 micron-sized dust grains.

  Evidence Against Baryons Shaping the Matter Distribution in Cluster Cores","  The process by which the mass density profile of certain galaxy clusters
becomes centrally concentrated enough to produce high strong lensing (SL)
cross-sections is not well understood. It has been suggested that the baryonic
condensation of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) due to cooling may drag dark
matter to the cores and thus steepen the profile. In this work, we search for
evidence of ongoing ICM cooling in the first large, well-defined sample of
strong lensing selected galaxy clusters in the range 0.1 < z < 0.6. Based on
known correlations between the ICM cooling rate and both optical emission line
luminosity and star formation, we measure, for a sample of 89 strong lensing
clusters, the fraction of clusters that have [OII]3727 emission in their
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the fraction of line-emitting BCGs
is constant as a function of redshift for z > 0.2 and shows no statistically
significant deviation from the total cluster population. Specific star
formation rates, as traced by the strength of the 4000 angstrom break, D_4000,
are also consistent with the general cluster population. Finally, we use
optical imaging of the SL clusters to measure the angular separation, R_arc,
between the arc and the center of mass of each lensing cluster in our sample
and test for evidence of changing [OII] emission and D_4000 as a function of
R_arc, a proxy observable for SL cross-sections. D_4000 is constant with all
values of R_arc, and the [OII] emission fractions show no dependence on R_arc
for R_arc > 10"" and only very marginal evidence of increased weak [OII]
emission for systems with R_arc < 10"". These results argue against the ability
of baryonic cooling associated with cool core activity in the cores of galaxy
clusters to strongly modify the underlying dark matter potential, leading to an
increase in strong lensing cross-sections.

volume (FV) approach. We demonstrate that the DG technique offers distinct
advantages over FV formulations on both static and moving meshes. The DG method
is also easily generalized to higher than second-order accuracy without
requiring the use of extended stencils to estimate derivatives (thereby making
the scheme highly parallelizable). We implement the technique in the AREPO code
for solving the fluid and the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. By examining
various test problems, we show that our new formulation provides improved
accuracy over FV approaches of the same order, and reduces post-shock
oscillations and artificial diffusion of angular momentum. In addition, the DG
method makes it possible to represent magnetic fields in a locally
divergence-free way, improving the stability of MHD simulations and moderating
global divergence errors, and is a viable alternative for solving the MHD
equations on meshes where Constrained-Transport (CT) cannot be applied. We find
that the DG procedure on a moving mesh is more sensitive to the choice of slope
limiter than is its FV method counterpart. Therefore, future work to improve
the performance of the DG scheme even further will likely involve the design of
optimal slope limiters. As presently constructed, our technique offers the
potential of improved accuracy in astrophysical simulations using the moving
mesh AREPO code as well as those employing adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).

  High-Velocity Ejecta","  We present three-dimensional kinematic reconstructions of optically emitting
material in the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). These
Doppler maps have the highest spectral and spatial resolutions of any previous
survey of Cas A and represent the most complete catalog of its optically
emitting material to date. We confirm that the bulk of Cas A's optically bright
ejecta populate a torus-like geometry tilted approximately 30 degrees with
respect to the plane of the sky with a -4000 to +6000 km/s radial velocity
asymmetry. Near-tangent viewing angle effects and an inhomogeneous surrounding
CSM/ISM environment suggest that this geometry and velocity asymmetry may not
be faithfully representative of the remnant's true 3D structure or the
kinematic properties of the original explosion. The majority of the optical
ejecta are arranged in several well-defined and nearly circular ring-like
structures with diameters between approximately 30 arcsec (0.5 pc) and 2 arcmin
(2 pc). These ejecta rings appear to be a common phenomenon of young
core-collapse remnants and may be associated with post-explosion input of
energy from plumes of radioactive 56Ni-rich ejecta that rise, expand, and
compress non-radioactive material. Our optical survey also encompassed Cas A's
faint outlying ejecta knots and exceptionally high-velocity NE and SW streams
of S-rich debris often referred to as `jets'. These outer knots, which exhibit
a chemical make-up suggestive of an origin deep within the progenitor star,
appear to be arranged in opposing and wide-angle outflows with opening
half-angles of approximately 40 degrees.

  Chandra X-ray Observatory Detectors","  The thermal evolution of young neutron stars (NSs) reflects the neutrino
emission properties of their cores. Heinke et al. (2010) measured a 3.6+/-0.6%
decay in the surface temperature of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) NS between 2000
and 2009, using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S
detector in Graded mode. Page et al. (2011) and Shternin et al. (2011)
attributed this decay to enhanced neutrino emission from a superfluid neutron
transition in the core. Here we test this decline, combining analysis of the
Cas A NS using all Chandra X-ray detectors and modes (HRC-S, HRC-I, ACIS-I,
ACIS-S in Faint mode, and ACIS-S in Graded mode) and adding a 2012 May ACIS-S
Graded mode observation, using the most current calibrations (CALDB 4.5.5.1).
We measure the temperature changes from each detector separately and test for
systematic effects due to the nearby filaments of the supernova remnant. We
find a 0.92%-2.0% decay over 10 years in the effective temperature, inferred
from HRC-S data, depending on the choice of source and background extraction
regions, with a best-fit decay of 1.0+/-0.7%. In comparison, the ACIS-S Graded
data indicate a temperature decay of 3.1%-5.0% over 10 years, with a best-fit
decay of 3.5+/-0.4%. Shallower observations using the other detectors yield
temperature decays of 2.6+/-1.9% (ACIS-I), 2.1+/-1.0% (HRC-I), and 2.1+/-1.9%
(ACIS-S Faint mode) over 10 years. Our best estimate indicates a decline of
2.9+/-0.9 (stat) +1.6/-0.3 (sys) % over 10 years. The complexity of the bright
and varying supernova remnant background makes a definitive interpretation of
archival Cas A Chandra observations difficult. A temperature decline of 1-3.5%
over 10 years would indicate extraordinarily fast cooling of the NS that can be
regulated by superfluidity of nucleons in the stellar core.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5265v1,Modeling X-ray binary evolution in normal galaxies: Insights from SINGS,"  We present the largest-scale comparison to date between observed
extragalactic X-ray binary (XRB) populations and theoretical models of their
production. We construct observational X-ray luminosity functions (oXLFs) using
Chandra observations of 12 late-type galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxy Survey (SINGS). For each galaxy, we obtain theoretical XLFs (tXLFs) by
combining XRB synthetic models, constructed with the population synthesis code
StarTrack, with observational star formation histories (SFHs). We identify
highest-likelihood models both for individual galaxies and globally, averaged
over the full galaxy sample. Individual tXLFs successfully reproduce about half
of oXLFs, but for some galaxies we are unable to find underlying source
populations, indicating that galaxy SFHs and metallicities are not well matched
and/or XRB modeling requires calibration on larger observational samples. Given
these limitations, we find that best models are consistent with a product of
common envelope ejection efficiency and central donor concentration ~=0.1, and
a 50% uniform -- 50% ""twins"" initial mass-ratio distribution. We present and
discuss constituent subpopulations of tXLFs according to donor, accretor and
stellar population characteristics. The galaxy-wide X-ray luminosity due to
low-mass and high-mass XRBs, estimated via our best global model tXLF, follows
the general trend expected from the L_x - star formation rate and L_x - stellar
mass relations of Lehmer et al 2010. Our best models are also in agreement with
modeling of the evolution both of XRBs over cosmic time and of the galaxy X-ray
luminosity with redshift.

  Binary Progenitors","  We present a detailed investigation of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
rest-frame UV/optical observations of 22 short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host
galaxies and sub-galactic environments. Utilizing the high angular resolution
and depth of HST, we characterize the host galaxy morphologies, measure precise
projected physical and host-normalized offsets between the bursts and host
centers, and calculate the locations of the bursts with respect to their host
light distributions (rest-frame UV and optical). We calculate a median short
GRB projected physical offset of 4.5 kpc, about 3.5 times larger than that for
long GRBs, and find that ~25% of short GRBs have offsets of >10 kpc. When
compared to their host sizes, the median offset is 1.5 half-light radii (r_e),
about 1.5 times larger than the values for long GRBs, core-collapse supernovae,
and Type Ia supernovae. In addition, ~20% of short GRBs having offsets of >5
r_e, and only ~25% are located within 1 r_e. We further find that short GRBs
severely under-represent their hosts' rest-frame optical and UV light, with
~30-45% of the bursts located in regions of their host galaxies that have no
detectable stellar light, and ~55% in the regions with no UV light. Therefore,
short GRBs do not occur in regions of star formation or even stellar mass. This
demonstrates that the progenitor systems of short GRBs must migrate from their
birth sites to their eventual explosion sites, a signature of kicks in compact
object binary systems. Utilizing the full sample of offsets, we estimate natal
kick velocities of ~20-140 km s^-1. These independent lines of evidence provide
the strongest support to date that short GRBs result from the merger of compact
object binaries (NS-NS/NS-BH).

which the supermassive black holes (BHs) powering luminous z ~ 6 QSOs grow from
massive seeds. We simulate at high resolution 18 fields sampling regions with
densities ranging from the mean cosmic density all the way to the highest sigma
peaks in the Millennium simulation volume. Only in the most massive halos, BHs
can grow to masses up to ~ 10^9 Msun by z ~ 6 without invoking super-Eddington
accretion. Accretion onto the most massive BHs becomes limited by thermal AGN
feedback by z ~ 9-8 with further BH growth proceeding in short Eddington
limited bursts. Our modelling suggests that current flux-limited surveys of
QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect objects at their peak luminosity
and therefore miss a substantial population of QSOs powered by similarly
massive BHs but with low accretion rates. To test whether the required host
halo masses are consistent with the observed galaxy environment of z ~ 6 QSOs,
we produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies. Without
strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of bright galaxies
larger than observed by a factor ten or more. Supernova-driven galactic winds
reduce the predicted numbers to a level consistent with observations indicating
that stellar feedback was already very efficient at high redshifts. We have
further investigated the effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas.
Our adopted AGN feedback prescription drives mostly energy-driven highly
anisotropic outflows with gas speeds of >= 1000 km/s to distances of >= 10 kpc
consistent with observations. The spatially extended thermal X-ray emission
around bright QSOs powered by these outflows can exceed by large factors the
emission expected without AGN feedback and is an important diagnostic of the
mechanism whereby AGN feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.

much less computation time is required. In the second part of the paper, we

collective excitations. For the Leggett mode our treatment provides an

lacking. We have performed X-ray and radio observations of seven UCDs in a

others show opposite behavior. We show that UCDs would still be
radio-over-luminous relative to the GBR even if their X-ray emission were at
standard rapid-rotator ""saturation"" levels. Recent results from Zeeman-Doppler
imaging and geodynamo simulations suggest that rapidly-rotating UCDs may harbor
a bistable dynamo that supports either a stronger, axisymmetric magnetic field
or a weaker, non-axisymmetric field. We suggest that the data can be explained
in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field
objects are radio-over-luminous and X-ray-under-luminous, possibly because of a
population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously

relationship with rotation with an increase until a ""saturation"" level and a
moderate decrease in activity in the very fastest rotators (""supersaturation"").
While X-ray data have suggested that this relationship is strongly violated in
ultracool dwarfs (UCDs; spectral type >M7), the limited number of X-ray
detections has prevented firm conclusions. In this paper, we analyze the X-ray
activity-rotation relation in 38 ultracool dwarfs. Our sample represents the
largest catalog of X-ray active ultracool dwarfs to date, including seven new
and four previously-unpublished Chandra observations presented in a companion
paper. We identify a substantial number of rapidly-rotating UCDs with X-ray
activity extending two orders of magnitude below the expected saturation level
and measure a ""supersaturation""-type anticorrelation between rotation and X-ray
activity. The scatter in UCD X-ray activity at a fixed rotation is ~3 times
larger than that in earlier-type stars. We discuss several mechanisms that have
been proposed to explain the data, including centrifugal stripping of the
corona, and find them to be inconsistent with the observed trends. Instead, we
suggest that an additional parameter correlated with both X-ray activity and
rotation is responsible for the observed effects. Building on the results of
Zeeman-Doppler imaging of UCD magnetic fields and our companion study of
radio/X-ray flux ratios, we argue that this parameter is the magnetic field

curves by Basri et al. (2011), with measurements of radial velocity (RV)
root-mean-square (RMS) variations of all California Planet Search overlap
stars. We newly derive rotation periods from the Kepler light curves for all of
the stars in our study sample. The RV variations reported herein range from
less than 4 m/s to 135 m/s, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric
variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for
chromospherically ""quiet"" stars. Despite the small size of our sample, we find
with high statistical significance that the RV RMS manifests strongly in the
Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in RV have a
greater number of frequency components in the light curve. We also find that
spot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the
observed RV variations by factors of ~2--1000, likely because the low level
photometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in
simple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler
light curves, dominated by a single relatively high amplitude component of
variability. Finally, we demonstrate that the RV RMS behavior of our sample can
be explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagram
introduced by Bastien et al. (2013). We use this diagram to derive the surface
gravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved off
the main-sequence. More generally, we find that the stars with the largest RV
RMS are those that have evolved onto the ""flicker floor"" sequence in that

http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5564v1,"Testing the No-Hair Theorem with Event Horizon Telescope Observations of
  Sagittarius A*","  The advent of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a millimeter-wave very-long
baseline interferometric array, has enabled spatially-resolved studies of the
sub-horizon-scale structure for a handful of supermassive black holes. Among
these, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius
A* (Sgr A*), presents the largest angular cross section. Thus far, these
studies have focused upon measurements of the black hole spin and the
validation of low-luminosity accretion models. However, a critical input into
the analysis of EHT data is the structure of the black hole spacetime, and thus
these observations provide the novel opportunity to test the applicability of
the Kerr metric to astrophysical black holes. Here we present the first
simulated images of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) around Sgr
A* employing a quasi-Kerr metric that contains an independent quadrupole moment
in addition to the mass and spin that fully characterize a black hole in
general relativity. We show that these images can be significantly different
from the images of a RIAF around a Kerr black hole with the same spin and
demonstrate the feasibility of testing the no-hair theorem by constraining the
quadrupolar deviation from the Kerr metric with existing EHT data. Equally
important, we find that the disk inclination and spin orientation angles are
robust to the inclusion of additional parameters, providing confidence in
previous estimations assuming the Kerr metric based upon EHT observations.
However, at present the limits upon potential modifications of the Kerr metric
remain weak.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3637v1,Line-of-Sight Structure Toward Strong Lensing Galaxy Clusters,"  We present an analysis of the line-of-sight structure toward a sample of ten
strong lensing cluster cores. Structure is traced by groups that are identified
spectroscopically in the redshift range, 0.1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.9, and we
measure the projected angular and comoving separations between each group and
the primary strong lensing clusters in each corresponding line of sight. From
these data we measure the distribution of projected angular separations between
the primary strong lensing clusters and uncorrelated large scale structure as
traced by groups. We then compare the observed distribution of angular
separations for our strong lensing selected lines of sight against the
distribution of groups that is predicted for clusters lying along random lines
of sight. There is clear evidence for an excess of structure along the line of
sight at small angular separations ($\theta \leq 6'$) along the strong lensing
selected lines of sight, indicating that uncorrelated structure is a
significant systematic that contributes to producing galaxy clusters with large
cross sections for strong lensing. The prevalence of line-of-sight structure is
one of several biases in strong lensing clusters that can potentially be folded
into cosmological measurements using galaxy cluster samples. These results also
have implications for current and future studies -- such as the Hubble Space
Telescope Frontier Fields -- that make use of massive galaxy cluster lenses as
precision cosmological telescopes; it is essential that the contribution of
line-of-sight structure be carefully accounted for in the strong lens modeling
of the cluster lenses.

light produces a relativistic beam of electron-positron pairs streaming through
the intergalactic medium (IGM). The fate of the beam energy is uncertain. By
means of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study the
non-linear evolution of dilute ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating
through the IGM. We explore a wide range of beam Lorentz factors gamma_b>>1 and
beam-to-plasma density ratios alpha<<1, so that our results can be extrapolated
to the extreme parameters of blazar-induced beams (gamma_b~10^6 and
alpha~10^(-15), for the most powerful blazars). For cold beams, we show that
the oblique instability governs the early stages of evolution, but its
exponential growth terminates - due to self-heating of the beam in the
transverse direction - when only a negligible fraction
~(alpha/gamma_b)^(1/3)~10^(-7) of the beam energy has been transferred to the
IGM plasma. Further relaxation of the beam proceeds through quasi-longitudinal
modes, until the momentum dispersion in the direction of propagation saturates
at DeltaP_{b,parallel}/gamma_b m_e c ~ 0.2. This corresponds to a fraction ~10%
of the beam energy being ultimately transferred to the IGM plasma, irrespective
of gamma_b or alpha. If the initial dispersion in beam momentum satisfies
DeltaP_{b,parallel}/gamma_b m_e c > 0.2 (as typically expected for
blazar-induced beams), the fraction of beam energy deposited into the IGM is
much smaller than ~10%. It follows that at least ~90% of the beam energy is
still available to power the GeV emission produced by inverse Compton

GRRMHD simulation of super-Eddington accretion (about $20$ times Eddington)
onto a rapidly rotating BH (dimensionless spin $j=0.9375$) shows sustained
non-axisymmemtric disk turbulence, a persistent electromagnetic jet driven by
the Blandford-Znajek effect, and a total radiative output consistently near the
Eddington rate. The total accretion efficiency is of order $20\%$, the
large-scale electromagnetic jet efficiency is of order $10\%$, and the total
radiative efficiency that reaches large distances remains low at only order
$1\%$. However, the radiation jet and the electromagnetic jet both emerge from
a geometrically beamed polar region, with super-Eddington isotropic equivalent
luminosities. Such simulations with HARMRAD can enlighten the role of BH spin

temporal states in x-ray binaries, help understand how tidal disruption events
(TDEs) work, provide an accurate horizon-scale flow structure for M87 and other

offsets in the broad Balmer lines with respect to the systemic redshift of the
host galaxy. Models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line region
gas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (BHs), orbital motion of
massive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (BBHs), or recoil BHs, but single-epoch
spectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. The line-of-sight
(LOS) radial velocity (RV) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring can
be used to test the BBH hypothesis. We have selected a sample of 399 quasars
with offset broad H-beta lines from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog, and have
conducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. Combined with the
existing SDSS spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the LOS RV
shifts of broad H-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years to
nearly a decade. Using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%
confidence) radial accelerations in the broad H-beta lines in 24 of the 50
objects. We suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc BBH candidates,
which show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a second
broad line (either H-alpha or Mg II) without significant changes in the
broad-line profiles. Combining the results on the general quasar population
studied in Paper I, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocity
offset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between two
epochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the time
separation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbital
period of the motion causing the line displacement. We discuss the implications
of our results for the identification of sub-pc BBH candidates in offset-line
quasars and for the constraints on their frequency and orbital parameters.

  Giant Star by Sgr A*","  The discovery of the gas cloud G2 on a near-radial orbit about Sgr A* has
prompted much speculation on its origin. In this Letter, we propose that G2
formed out of the debris stream produced by the removal of mass from the outer
envelope of a nearby giant star. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the
returning tidal debris stream with cooling, and find that the stream condenses
into clumps that fall periodically onto Sgr A*. We propose that one of these
clumps is the observed G2 cloud, with the rest of the stream being detectable
at lower Br-$\gamma$ emissivity along a trajectory that would trace from G2 to
the star that was partially disrupted. By simultaneously fitting the orbits of
S2, G2, and $\sim$ 2,000 candidate stars, and by fixing the orbital plane of
each candidate star to G2 (as is expected for a tidal disruption), we find that
several stars have orbits that are compatible with the notion that one of them
was tidally disrupted to produce G2. If one of these stars were indeed
disrupted, it last encountered Sgr A* hundreds of years ago, and has likely
encountered Sgr A* repeatedly. However, while these stars are compatible with
the giant disruption scenario given their measured positions and proper
motions, their radial velocities are currently unknown. If one of these stars'
radial velocity is measured to be compatible with a disruptive orbit, it would
strongly suggest its disruption produced G2.

Gilliss,astronomer at the newly founded U.S. Naval Observatory,
enthusiastically adopted this idea and procured a grant for the young
astronomical community of the United States for an expedition to Chile. There
they were to observe several conjunctions of Venus and oppositions of Mars,
while the accompanying measurements were to be taken at the US Naval
Observatory in Washington D.C. and the Harvard College Observatory at
Cambridge, USA. This expedition was supported by A. v. Humboldt, C.F. Gau{\ss},
J.F. Encke, S.C. Walker, A.D. Bache, B. Peirce and others. From 1849 to 1852
not only were astronomical, but also meteorological and magnetic observations
and measurements recorded, mainly in Santa Lucia close to Santiago, Chile. By
comparing these measurements with those taken simultaneously at other
observatories around the world the solar parallax could be calculated, although
incomplete data from the corresponding northern observatories threatened the
project's success. In retrospect this expedition can be recognized as the
foundation of the Chilean astronomy. The first director of the new National

quantify the cumulative magnification power of the HFF clusters, (3) describe
how our models can be used to estimate the magnification and image multiplicity
of lensed background sources at all redshifts and at any position within the

spectroscopic and photometric redshift constraints on the uncertainties of the

galaxies are generally in excellent agreement with spectroscopic redshifts,
where available. However, the flexibility associated with relaxed redshift
priors may cause the complexity of large-scale structure that is needed to
account for the lensing signal to be underestimated. Our findings thus
underline the importance of spectroscopic arc redshifts, or tight photometric
redshift constraints, for high precision lens models.

The data coverage range from mere identification (1-3 spectra) for a few SNe to
extensive series of observations (10-30 spectra) that trace the spectral
evolution for others, with an average of 9 spectra per SN. For 44 SNe of the 73

the phase of each spectrum. Our sample constitutes the most extensive spectral
library of stripped-envelope SNe to date. We provide very early coverage (as

late-time nebular coverage when the innermost regions of the SNe are visible
(as late as 2 years after explosion, while for SN1993J, we have data as late as

and to compare these to SNe associated with gamma-ray bursts. We undertake
these matters in follow-up papers.

  Shocks. I. Particle Energy Spectra and Acceleration Mechanism","  Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies in low Mach number (M<5) shocks
is revealed by radio and X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and solar
flares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood.
Diffusive shock acceleration, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration,
cannot be directly invoked to explain the acceleration of electrons. Rather, an
additional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal
to supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process.
In this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma
simulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus
on the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference
run with M=3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field. We find that
about 15 percent of the electrons can be efficiently accelerated, forming a
non-thermal power-law tail in the energy spectrum with a slope of p~2.4.
Initially, thermal electrons are energized at the shock front via shock drift
acceleration. The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream, where
their interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the
waves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock, for
further energization via shock drift acceleration. In summary, the
self-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of shock drift acceleration,
similarly to a sustained Fermi-like process. This mechanism offers a natural
solution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed
from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration
efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7477v1,High speed magnetized flows in the quiet Sun,"  We have examined the spatial and polarimetric properties of these events
using a variety of data from the Hinode spacecraft. We have also inferred the
atmospheric stratification of the physical parameters by means of the inversion
of the observed Stokes profiles employing the Stokes Inversion based on
Response functions (SIR) code. Finally, we analyzed their evolution using a
time series from the same instrument. Blue-shifted events tend to appear over
bright regions at the edge of granules, while red-shifted events are seen
predominantly over dark regions on intergranular lanes. Large linear
polarization signals can be seen in the region that connects them. The magnetic
structure inferred from the time series revealed that the structure corresponds
to a $\Omega$-loop, with one footpoint always over the edge of a granule and
the other inside an intergranular lane. The physical parameters obtained from
the inversions of the observed Stokes profiles in both events show an increase
with respect to the Harvard-Smithonian reference atmosphere in the temperature
at $\log\tau_{500} \in (-1, -3)$ and a strong magnetic field, $B \ge 1$ kG, at
the bottom of the atmosphere that quickly decreases upward until vanishing at
$\log\tau_{500} \approx -2$. In the blue-shifted events, the line of sight
velocities change from upflows at the bottom to downflows at the top of the
atmosphere. Red-shifted events display the opposite velocity stratification.
The change of sign in line of sight velocity happens at the same optical depth
in which the magnetic field becomes zero. The physical mechanism that best
explains the inferred magnetic field configuration and flow motions is a siphon
flow along an arched magnetic flux tube. Further investigation is required
however, as the expected features of a siphon flow cannot be unequivocally
identified.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0401v1,"Development and Application of Tools to Characterize Transiting
  Astrophysical Systems","  Since the discovery of the first exoplanets more than 20 years ago, there has
been an increasing need for photometric and spectroscopic models to
characterize these systems. While imaging has been used extensively for Solar
System bodies and extended objects like galaxies, the small angular extent of
typical planetary systems makes it difficult or impossible to resolve them.
Spatially integrated observations like measuring the total brightness or
spectrum, however, can be conducted at a resonable cost. This thesis focuses on
photometric models in the context of transiting systems, which exhibit a number
of phenomena that can be exploited for characterization.
  First, we showcase the popular methods of transiting exoplanet discovery and
characterization by ground based observations on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-27b. We
demonstrate how transits allow us to constrain planetary mass, radius, and
orbital inclination, which would not be possible based only on, for example,
radial velocity measurements.
  Next, we perform reflection spectroscopy on HAT-P-1b, another hot Jupiter,
using the binary companion of the host star as a reference to remove systematic
errors from the signal. Here the transiting nature of the system allows us to
look for the very faint light reflected by the planet.
  We also apply the idea of planetary transits to investigate the feasibility
of transit observations in astrophysical systems of very different scale: stars
in galactic nuclei potentially transiting the accretion disk of the
supermassive black hole in the galactic center.
  Finally, we focus on mapping spots on the stellar surface using transits.
This method has been used for a decade, and helped constrain stellar rotation
or orbital geometry in a number systems. We study starspots on HAT-P-11 to
learn more about stellar rotation and to investigate the size and contrast of
the spots themselves.

hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 Mpc)^3 volume with more than
12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models
relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for
redshifts z = 0 - 5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by
Illustris are in very good agreement with the most recent observational
constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of
AGN at z = 0 and 1 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic
range probed. Unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated,
this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon_r <= 0.1,
noting however that in our model radiative efficiencies are degenerate with
black hole feedback efficiencies. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in
broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we predict a larger
number density of faint AGN at high redshifts than currently inferred. We also
study black hole -- host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy
morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes
and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and
star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central
black hole masses or the nuclear AGN activity.

observations of the active, young, low-mass binary NLTT 33370 AB (blended
spectral type M7e). This system is remarkable for its extreme levels of
magnetic activity: it is the most radio-luminous ultracool dwarf (UCD) known,
and here we show that it is also one of the most X-ray luminous UCDs known. We
detect the system in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring
and periodic variability. Analysis of the optical light curve reveals the
simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 $\pm$ 0.0001 and 3.7130
$\pm$ 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential
rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two
signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components:
rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase
with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears
only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a
gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool,
equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational
phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect
nearly continuously. We present an SED of the blended system spanning more than
9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT
33370 AB will affect its fundamental parameters, with the components' radii and
temperatures potentially altered by ~+20% and ~-10%, respectively. Finally, we

due to their motion through the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Deep X-ray
observations reveal the fine-structure of the galaxy's remnant atmosphere and
its gas tail and wake. This fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions
(galaxy potential, initial gas contents, orbit through the host cluster),
orbital stage (early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), and ICM plasma
properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity, magnetic field structure). We aim
to disentangle dynamic and plasma effects in order to use stripped ellipticals
as probes of ICM plasma properties. This first paper of a series investigates
the hydrodynamics of progressive gas stripping by means of inviscid
hydrodynamical simulations. We distinguish a long-lasting initial relaxation
phase and a quasi-steady stripping phase. During quasi-steady stripping, the
ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere resembles the flow around solid bodies,
including a `deadwater' region in the near wake. Gas is stripped from the
remnant atmosphere predominantly at its sides via Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. The downstream atmosphere is largely shielded from the ICM wind
and thus shaped into a tail. Observationally, both, this `remnant tail' and the
stripped gas in the wake can appear as a `tail', but only in the wake can
galactic gas mix with the ambient ICM. While the qualitative results are
generic, the simulations presented here are tailored to the Virgo elliptical
galaxy M89 (NGC 4552) for the most direct comparison to observations. Papers II

progressively stripped of their gaseous atmospheres. X-ray observations reveal
the structure of galactic tails, wakes, and the interface between the galactic
gas and the ICM. This fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions (galaxy
potential, initial gas contents, orbit in the host cluster), orbital stage

ill-constrained ICM plasma properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity,
magnetic field structure). Paper I describes flow patterns and stages of
inviscid gas stripping. Here we study the effect of a Spitzer-like temperature
dependent viscosity corresponding to Reynolds numbers, Re, of 50 to 5000 with
respect to the ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere. Global flow patterns are
independent of viscosity in this Reynolds number range. Viscosity influences
two aspects: In inviscid stripping, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs) at
the sides of the remnant atmosphere lead to observable horns or wings.
Increasing viscosity suppresses KHIs of increasing length scale, and thus
observable horns and wings. Furthermore, in inviscid stripping, stripped
galactic gas can mix with the ambient ICM in the galaxy's wake. This mixing is
suppressed increasingly with increasing viscosity, such that viscously stripped
galaxies have long X-ray bright, cool wakes. We provide mock X-ray images for
different stripping stages and conditions. While these qualitative results are

detected previously due to X-ray variability. Twelve sources show significant
long-term variability, with no correlated spectral changes. Seven sources are
transient candidates. One ULX coincides with an extremely blue star cluster
(B-V = -0.7). We confirm that the global relation between the number and
luminosity of ULXs and the integrated star formation rate (SFR) of the host

extinction and/or age on the X-ray binary (XRB) population on sub-galactic
scales. The distributions of Nx and Lx are peaked at L(IR)/L(NUV)~1, which may
be associated with an age of ~10 Myr for the underlying stellar population. We
find that ~1/3 of the XRBs are located in close proximity to young star
complexes. The luminosity function of the X-ray binaries is consistent with
that typical for high-mass X-ray binaries, and appears unaffected by
variability. We disentangle and compare the X-ray diffuse spectrum with that of
the bright XRBs. The hot interstellar medium dominates the diffuse X-ray

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5817v1,"The Dark Matter Halos of Moderate Luminosity X-ray AGN as Determined
  from Weak Gravitational Lensing and Host Stellar Masses","  Understanding the relationship between galaxies hosting active galactic
nuclei (AGN) and the dark matter halos in which they reside is key to
constraining how black-hole fueling is triggered and regulated. Previous
efforts have relied on simple halo mass estimates inferred from clustering,
weak gravitational lensing, or halo occupation distribution modeling. In
practice, these approaches remain uncertain because AGN, no matter how they are
identified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupation
function whose general shape and normalization are poorly known. In this work,
we show that better constraints can be achieved through a rigorous comparison
of the clustering, lensing, and cross-correlation signals of AGN hosts to a
fiducial stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) derived for all galaxies. Our
technique exploits the fact that the global SHMR can be measured with much
higher accuracy than any statistic derived from AGN samples alone. Using 382
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN at z<1 from the COSMOS field, we report the first
measurements of weak gravitational lensing from an X-ray selected sample.
Comparing this signal to predictions from the global SHMR, we find that,
contrary to previous results, most X-ray AGN do not live in medium size groups
---nearly half reside in relatively low mass halos with Mh~10^12.5 Msun. The
AGN occupation function is well described by the same form derived for all
galaxies but with a lower normalization---the fraction of halos with AGN in our
sample is a few percent. By highlighting the relatively ""normal"" way in which
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts occupy halos, our results suggest that the
environmental signature of distinct fueling modes for luminous QSOs compared to
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN is less obvious than previously claimed.

  Accretion Flows. I. Compression-Driven Instabilities and the Electron Heating
  Mechanism","  In systems accreting well below the Eddington rate, the plasma in the
innermost regions of the disk is collisionless and two-temperature, with the
ions hotter than the electrons. Yet, whether a collisionless
faster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature
accretion flows is still an open question. We study the physics of electron
heating during the growth of ion velocity-space instabilities, by means of
multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A large-scale compression
- embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations - continuously amplifies the
field. This constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P_perp > P_parallel, due to
the adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for
ion plasma beta values beta_i ~ 5-30 appropriate for the midplane of
low-luminosity accretion flows, mirror modes dominate if the electron-to-proton
temperature ratio is > 0.2, whereas if it is < 0.2 the ion cyclotron
instability triggers the growth of strong Alfven-like waves, that pitch-angle
scatter the ions to maintain marginal stability. We develop an analytical model
of electron heating during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability, which
we validate with PIC simulations. We find that for cold electrons (beta_e <
m_e/m_i), the electron energy gain is controlled by the magnitude of the
E-cross-B velocity induced by the ion cyclotron waves. This term is independent
of the initial electron temperature, so it provides a solid energy floor even
for electrons starting with extremely low temperatures. On the other hand, the
electron energy gain for beta_e > m_e/m_i - governed by the conservation of the
magnetic moment in the growing fields of the instability - is proportional to
the initial electron temperature. Our results have implications for
two-temperature accretion flows as well as the solar wind and intracluster
plasmas. [abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6014v1,"Electron Heating by the Ion Cyclotron Instability in Collisionless
  Accretion Flows. II. Electron Heating Efficiency as a Function of Flow
  Conditions","  In the innermost regions of low-luminosity accretion flows, including Sgr A*
at the center of our Galaxy, the frequency of Coulomb collisions is so low that
the plasma is two-temperature, with the ions substantially hotter than the
electrons. This paradigm assumes that Coulomb collisions are the only channel
for transferring the ion energy to the electrons. In this work, the second of a
series, we assess the efficiency of electron heating by ion velocity-space
instabilities in collisionless accretion flows. The instabilities are seeded by
the pressure anisotropy induced by magnetic field amplification, coupled to the
adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. Using two-dimensional
(2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we showed in Paper I that if the
electron-to-ion temperature ratio is < 0.2, the ion cyclotron instability is
the dominant mode for values of ion beta_i ~ 5-30 (here, beta_i is the ratio of
ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure), as appropriate for the midplane of
low-luminosity accretion flows. In this work, we employ analytical theory and
1D PIC simulations (with the box aligned with the fastest growing wavevector of
the ion cyclotron mode) to fully characterize how the electron heating
efficiency during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability depends on the
electron-to-proton temperature ratio, the plasma beta, the Alfven speed, the
amplification rate of the mean field (in units of the ion Larmor frequency) and
the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Our findings can be incorporated as a
physically-grounded sub-grid model into global fluid simulations of
low-luminosity accretion flows, thus helping to assess the validity of the
two-temperature assumption.

  XO-2S -- Dependence on Stellar Parameters","  The chemical composition of exoplanet host stars is an important factor in
understanding the formation and characteristics of their orbiting planets. The
best example of this to date is the planet-metallicity correlation. Other
proposed correlations are thus far less robust, in part due to uncertainty in
the chemical history of stars pre- and post-planet formation. Binary host stars
of similar type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of planets on
host star abundances. Here we present a differential elemental abundance
analysis of the XO-2 stellar binary, in which both G9 stars host giant planets,
one of which is transiting. Building on our previous work, we report 16
elemental abundances and compare the $\Delta$(XO-2N-XO-S) values to elemental
condensation temperatures. The $\Delta$(N-S) values and slopes with
condensation temperature resulting from four different pairs of stellar
parameters are compared to explore the effects of changing the relative
temperature and gravity of the stars. We find that most of the abundance
differences between the stars depend on the chosen stellar parameters, but that
Fe, Si, and potentially Ni are consistently enhanced in XO-2N regardless of the
chosen stellar parameters. This study emphasizes the power of binary host star
abundance analysis for probing the effects of giant planet formation, but also
illustrates the potentially large uncertainties in abundance differences and
slopes induced by changes in stellar temperature and gravity.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05306v3,A Dark Year for Tidal Disruption Events,"  The disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole results
in the initial production of an extended debris stream that winds repeatedly
around the black hole, producing a complex three-dimensional figure that may
self-intersect. Both analytical work and simulations have shown that typical
encounters generate streams that are extremely thin. In this paper we show that
this implies that even small relativistic precessions attributed to black hole
spin can induce deflections that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even
after many windings. Additionally, hydrodynamical simulations have demonstrated
that energy is deposited very slowly via hydrodynamic processes alone,
resulting in the liberation of very little gravitational binding energy in the
absence of stream-stream collisions. This naturally leads to a ""dark period"" in
which the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen
orbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for
disruptions around black holes with mass $\sim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$. We find that
more-massive black holes tend to have more violent stream self-intersections,
resulting in short viscous times that lead to prompt accretion onto the black
hole. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the
black hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed
delay time $t_{\rm delay}$. For lower black hole masses ($M_{\rm h} \lesssim
10^{6}$), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of
magnitude, and because the accretion rates for TDEs about higher-mass black
hole are already sub-Eddington, this results in the majority of TDEs being
sub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are
biased towards prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been
unidentified. [abridged]

http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06908v2,Carbon in Red Giants in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies,"  We present carbon abundances of red giants in Milky Way globular clusters and
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our sample includes measurements of carbon
abundances for 154 giants in the clusters NGC 2419, M68, and M15 and 398 giants
in the dSphs Sculptor, Fornax, Ursa Minor, and Draco. This sample doubles the
number of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the
clusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which
can be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is
observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.
Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize
that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with
increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of
asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia
supernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich
giants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases
preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way
stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] < +1 in dSphs follow a
different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in
dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the
metallicity of the [C/Fe] ""knee"" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe]
distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for
chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.

lenses among the population of low-redshift early-type galaxies. The SINFONI
Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey (SNELLS) uses integral-field infrared
spectroscopy to search for lensed emission line sources behind massive lens
candidates at $z$<0.055. From 27 galaxies observed, we have recovered one
previously-known lens (ESO325-G004) at $z$=0.034, and discovered two new
systems, at $z$=0.031 and $z$=0.052. All three lens galaxies have high velocity
dispersions (\sigma>300 km/s) and \alpha-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]>0.3). From
the lensing configurations we derive total J-band mass-to-light ratios of
1.8$\pm$0.1, 2.1$\pm$0.1 and 1.9$\pm$0.2 within the $\sim$2 kpc Einstein
radius. Correcting for estimated dark-matter contributions, and comparing to
stellar population models with a Milky Way (Kroupa) initial mass function
(IMF), we determine the ""mass excess factor"", \alpha. Assuming the lens
galaxies have ""old"" stellar populations (10$\pm$1 Gyr), the average IMF mass
factor is $\langle\alpha\rangle$=1.10$\pm$0.08$\pm$0.10, where the first error
is random and the second is systematic. If we instead fit the stellar
populations from 6dF optical survey spectra, all three galaxies are consistent
with being old, but the age errors are 3-4 Gyr, due to limited signal-to-noise.
The IMF constraints are therefore looser in this case, with
$\langle\alpha\rangle$ = $1.23^{+0.16}_{-0.13}\pm{0.10}$. Our results are thus
consistent with a Kroupa IMF (\alpha=1.00) on average, and strongly reject very
heavy IMFs with \alpha>2. A Salpeter IMF (\alpha=1.55) is inconsistent at the
3.5$\sigma$ level if the galaxies are old, but cannot be excluded using age
constraints derived from the currently-available optical spectra.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03483v1,The low-frequency radio catalog of flat spectrum sources,"  A well known property of the gamma-ray sources detected by COS-B in the
1970s, by the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory in the 1990s and recently by the
Fermi observations is the presence of radio counterparts, in particular for
those associated to extragalactic objects. This observational evidence is the
basis of the radio-gamma-ray connection established for the class of active
galactic nuclei known as blazars. In particular, the main spectral property of
the radio counterparts associated with gamma-ray blazars is that they show a
flat spectrum in the GHz frequency range. Our recent analysis dedicated to
search blazar-like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentified
gamma-ray sources (UGSs) allowed us to extend the radio-gamma-ray connection in
the MHz regime. We also showed that below 1 GHz blazars maintain flat radio
spectra. Thus on the basis of these new results, we assembled a low-frequency
radio catalog of flat spectrum sources built by combining the radio
observations of the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and of the
Westerbork in the southern hemisphere (WISH) catalog with those of the NRAO
Very Large Array Sky survey (NVSS). This could be used in the future to search
for new, unknown blazar-like counterparts of the gamma-ray sources. First we
found NVSS counterparts of WSRT radio sources and then we selected flat
spectrum radio sources according to a new spectral criterion specifically
defined for radio observations performed below 1 GHz. We also described the
main properties of the catalog listing 28358 radio sources and their logN-logS
distributions. Finally a comparison with with the Green Bank 6-cm radio source
catalog has been performed to investigate the spectral shape of the
low-frequency flat spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies.

auctions where a buyer wishes to procure multiple units of a homogeneous item
from n sellers who are strategic about their per unit valuation. The buyer
earns the profit by reselling these units in an external consumer market. The
paper looks at three scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we look at unit
capacity sellers where per unit valuation is private information of each seller
and the revenue curve is concave. For this setting, we define two benchmarks.
We show that no randomized prior free auction can be constant competitive
against any of these two benchmarks. However, for a lightly constrained
benchmark we design a prior-free auction PEPA (Profit Extracting Procurement
Auction) which is 4-competitive and we show this bound is tight. Second, we
study a setting where the sellers have non-unit capacities that are common
knowledge and derive similar results. In particular, we propose a prior free
auction PEPAC (Profit Extracting Procurement Auction with Capacity) which is
truthful for any concave revenue curve. Third, we obtain results in the
inherently harder bi-dimensional case where per unit valuation as well as
capacities are private information of the sellers. We show that PEPAC is

Spitzer data. We select 186 young stellar object (YSO) candidates in the region
on the basis of multi-colour criteria, confirm the YSO nature of the majority
of them using published spectroscopy from the literature, and use this sample
to investigate the overall star formation properties in L1630N. The K-band
luminosity function of L1630N is remarkably similar to that of the Trapezium
cluster, i.e., it presents a broad peak in the range 0.3-0.7 M$_\odot$ and a
fraction of sub-stellar objects of $\sim$20%. The fraction of YSOs still
surrounded by disk/envelopes is very high ($\sim$85%) compared to other star
forming regions of similar age (1-2 Myr), but includes some uncertain
corrections for diskless YSOs. Yet, a possibly high disk fraction together with
the fact that 1/3 of the cloud mass has a gas surface density above the
threshold for star formation ($\sim$129 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), points towards a
still on-going star formation activity in L1630N. The star formation efficiency
(SFE), star formation rate (SFR) and density of star formation of L1630N are
within the ranges estimated for galactic star forming regions by the Spitzer

than the average value measured in the Orion A cloud and, in particular, lower

  Energetics, Circumburst Densities, and Jet Opening Angles","  We present a comprehensive catalog and analysis of broad-band afterglow
observations for 103 short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), comprised of all
short GRBs from November 2004 to March 2015 with prompt follow-up observations
in the X-ray, optical, near-infrared and/or radio bands. These afterglow
observations have uncovered 71 X-ray detections, 30 optical/NIR detections, and
4 radio detections. Employing the standard afterglow synchrotron model, we
perform joint probability analyses for a subset of 38 short GRBs with
well-sampled light curves to infer the burst isotropic-equivalent energies and
circumburst densities. For this subset, we find median isotropic-equivalent
gamma-ray and kinetic energies of E_gamma,iso~2x10^51 erg, and
E_K,iso~(1-3)x10^51 erg, respectively, depending on the values of the model
input parameters. We further find that short GRBs occur in low-density
environments, with a median density of n~(3-15)x10^-3 cm^-3, and that ~80-95%
of bursts have densities of less than 1 cm^-3. We investigate trends between
the circumburst densities and host galaxy properties, and find that events
located at large projected offsets of >10 effective radii from their hosts
exhibit particularly low densities of n<10^-4 cm^-3, consistent with an
IGM-like environment. Using late-time afterglow data for 11 events, we find a
median jet opening angle of theta_jet=16+/-10 deg. We also calculate a median
beaming factor of f_b~0.04, leading to a beaming-corrected total energy release
of E_true~1.6x10^50 erg. Furthermore, we calculate a beaming-corrected event
rate of R_true=270 (+1580,-180) Gpc^-3 yr^-1, or ~8 (+47,-5) yr^-1 within a 200

nearby (d $\sim$ 10 kpc) objects discovered in SDSS data. Previous studies of
the region have shown that EBS and Hydra I are spatially coincident, cold
structures at the same distance, suggesting that Hydra I may be the EBS's
progenitor. We combine new wide-field DECam imaging and MMT/Hectochelle
spectroscopic observations of Hydra I with SDSS archival spectroscopic
observations to quantify Hydra I's present-day chemodynamical properties, and
to infer whether it originated as a star cluster or dwarf galaxy. While
previous work using shallow SDSS imaging assumed a standard old, metal-poor
stellar population, our deeper DECam imaging reveals that Hydra~I has a thin,
well-defined main sequence turnoff of intermediate age ($\sim 5-6$ Gyr) and
metallicity ([Fe/H] = $-0.9$ dex). We measure statistically significant spreads
in both the iron and alpha-element abundances of $\sigma_{[Fe/H]} = 0.13 \pm
0.02$ dex and $\sigma_{[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]} = 0.09 \pm 0.03$ dex, respectively,
and place upper limits on both the rotation and its proper motion. Hydra~I's
intermediate age and [Fe/H] -- as well as its low [$\alpha$/Fe], apparent
[Fe/H] spread, and present-day low luminosity -- suggest that its progenitor
was a dwarf galaxy, which subsequently lost more than $99.99\%$ of its stellar
mass.

  of Stars by Supermassive Black Holes","  The kinetic energy of a star in orbit about a supermassive black hole is a
significant fraction of its rest mass energy when its periapse is comparable to
its tidal radius. Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted
and injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the
black hole, with the fastest material moving at $\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,
we present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams
(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding
gas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that
hydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the
densest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs
travel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with
distance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the
ambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This
sudden injection of $\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a
Sedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)
in energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic
rays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the
molecular clouds surrounding a black hole. We estimate that a few of these UDRs
might be present within a couple degrees of the Galactic Center masquerading as
SNRs, and that the UDR scenario is a plausible explanation for Sgr A East.

make a close approach. These extreme events are discovered via bright X-ray and

accretion rate. Here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized X-ray

Variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas is
relatively close to the black hole. Narrow line widths indicate that the gas
does not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume filling
factor. Modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second are
observed, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set by
variability. The gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,
super-Eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament of
disrupted stellar gas near to the apocenter of an elliptical orbit. Flows of
this sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory and more recent

fields have yielded very likely identifications of X-ray counterparts for three
of the IGR sources: IGR J14091-6108, IGR J18088-2741, and IGR J18381-0924. The
first two have very hard spectra in the Chandra band that can be described by a
power-law with photon indices of Gamma = 0.6+/-0.4 and -0.7(+0.4)(-0.3),
respectively (90% confidence errors are given), and both have a unique near-IR
counterpart consistent with the Chandra position. IGR J14091-6108 also displays
a strong iron line and a relatively low X-ray luminosity, and we argue that the
most likely source type is a Cataclysmic Variable (CV), although we do not
completely rule out the possibility of a High Mass X-ray Binary. IGR
J18088-2741 has an optical counterpart with a previously measured 6.84 hr
periodicity, which may be the binary orbital period. We also detect five cycles
of a possible 800-950 s period in the Chandra light curve, which may be the
compact object spin period. We suggest that IGR J18088-2741 is also most likely
a CV. For IGR J18381-0924, the spectrum is intrinsically softer with Gamma =
1.5(+0.5)(-0.4), and it is moderately absorbed, nH = (4+/-1)e22 cm-2. There are
two near-IR sources consistent with the Chandra position, and they are both
classified as galaxies, making it likely that IGR J18381-0924 is an Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN). For the other five IGR sources, we provide lists of
nearby Chandra sources, which may be used along with further observations to
identify the correct counterparts, and we discuss the implications of the low

http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03834v2,"Are the Formation and Abundances of Metal-Poor Stars the Result of Dust
  Dynamics?","  Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative
to gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before
reionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple
arguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in
local abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have
important consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely
metal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost
immediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is
too low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars
may contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in
large carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)
can be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling
abundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard
core-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We
also show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in
these species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are
correlated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local
silicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure
SNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,
preferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)
dust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio
fluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light
element abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust
where they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis.

matter and dark radiation on the linear initial power spectrum and dark matter
self-interactions during non-linear structure formation. We simulate a Milky
Way-like halo in four different dark matter models and the cold dark matter
case. Our highest resolution simulation has a particle mass of $2.8\times
10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and a softening length of $72.4\,{\rm pc}$. We demonstrate
that all alternative models have only a negligible impact on large scale
structure formation. On galactic scales, however, the models significantly
affect the structure and abundance of subhaloes due to the combined effects of
small scale primordial damping in the power spectrum and late time
self-interactions. We derive an analytic mapping from the primordial damping
scale in the power spectrum to the cutoff scale in the halo mass function and
the kinetic decoupling temperature. We demonstrate that certain models within
this extended effective framework that can alleviate the too-big-to-fail and
missing satellite problems simultaneously, and possibly the core-cusp problem.
The primordial power spectrum cutoff of our models naturally creates a
diversity in the circular velocity profiles, which is larger than that found
for cold dark matter simulations. We show that the parameter space of models
can be constrained by contrasting model predictions to astrophysical
observations. For example, some models may be challenged by the missing
satellite problem if baryonic processes were to be included and even over-solve
the too-big-to-fail problem; thus ruling them out.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08131v1,"Pressure-anisotropy-driven microturbulence and magnetic-field evolution
  in shearing, collisionless plasma","  The nonlinear state of a high-beta collisionless plasma is investigated when
an imposed linear shear amplifies or diminishes a uniform magnetic field,
driving pressure anisotropies and hence firehose/mirror instabilities. The
evolution of the resulting microscale turbulence is considered when the shear
is switched off or reversed after one shear time (mimicking local behaviour of
a macroscopic flow), so a new macroscale configuration is superimposed on the
microscale state left behind by the previous one. There is a threshold value of
plasma beta: when $\beta\ll\Omega/S$ (ion cyclotron frequency/shear rate), the
emergence of firehose/mirror fluctuations driven unstable by shear and their
disappearance when the shear is removed/reversed are quasi-instantaneous
compared to the shear time, viz., the decay time of these fluctuations is
$\sim\beta/\Omega \ll 1/S$ (this result follows from the free decay of the
fluctuations being constrained by the same marginal-stability thresholds as
their growth). In contrast, when $\beta\gtrsim\Omega/S$ (""ultra-high"" beta),
the old microscale state can only be removed on the shear timescale. In this
regime, driven firehose fluctuations grow secularly to order-unity amplitudes,
compensating for the decay of the mean field and so pinning pressure anisotropy
at marginal stability with no appreciable scattering of particles---which is
unlike what happens at moderate $\beta$. When the shear reverses, the shearing
away of this firehose turbulence compensates for the increase in the mean field

going mirror-unstable. Therefore, at ultra-high beta, the system stays close to

thus the origin of cosmic magnetism are discussed.

keV band and existing upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum to constrain the
high-redshift population of X-ray sources, focusing on their effect on the
thermal history of the Universe and the cosmic 21-cm signal. Because the
properties of these sources are poorly constrained, we consider hot gas, X-ray
binaries and mini-quasars (i.e., sources with soft or hard X-ray spectra) as
possible candidates. We find that (1) the soft-band CXRB sets an upper limit on
the X-ray efficiency of sources that existed before the end of reionization,
which is one-to-two orders of magnitude higher than typically assumed
efficiencies, (2) hard sources are more effective in generating the CXRB than
the soft ones, (3) the commonly-assumed limit of saturated heating is not valid
during the first half of reionization in the case of hard sources, with any
allowed value of X-ray efficiency, (4) the maximal allowed X-ray efficiency
sets a lower limit on the depth of the absorption trough in the global 21-cm
signal and an upper limit on the height of the emission peak, while in the
21-cm power spectrum it sets a minimum amplitude and frequency for the
high-redshift peaks, and (5) the existing upper limit on the 21-cm power
spectrum sets a lower limit on the X-ray efficiency for each model. When
combined with the 21-cm global signal, the CXRB will be useful for breaking
degeneracies and helping constrain the nature of high-redshift heating sources.

  signalling networks","  The study of cellular signalling pathways and their deregulation in disease
states, such as cancer, is a large and extremely complex task. Indeed, these
systems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their
literatures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at
least apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build
significant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems
that are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.
  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the
representation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in
signalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,
capable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by
post-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires
highly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every
interaction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these
conditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from
information contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the
story.
  In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the
representation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive
cognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a
generalization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible
representation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it
allows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much,
detail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides
a basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge
extracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we
can define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.

break appears at the pulse frequency which separates the zero slope at low
frequency from the steeper slope at high frequency. This addition of angular
momentum to the neutron star could be due to the accretion of a quasi-spherical
wind, or it could be caused by the transient appearance of a prograde accretion
disk that is nearly in corotation with the neutron star whose magnetospheric
radius is around 2e8 cm.

in relativistic magnetically-dominated plasmas and apply it to explain
gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula. The model relies on development of
current-driven instabilities on macroscopic scales (not related to plasma skin
depths). Using analytical and numerical methods (fluid and particle-in-cell
simulations), we study a number of model problems in relativistic
magnetically-dominated plasma: (i) we extend Syrovatsky's classical model of
explosive X-point collapse to magnetically-dominated plasmas; (ii) we consider
instability of two-dimensional force-free system of magnetic flux tubes; (iii)
we consider merger of two zero total poloidal current magnetic flux tubes. In
all cases regimes of spontaneous and driven evolution are investigated. We
identify two stages of particle acceleration: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point
collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during
the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection electric field
of the order of the magnetic field. The explosive stage of reconnection
produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend on the average
magnetization. The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger
that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy in a regime of
forced reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds at a
slower reconnection rate. Crab flares result from the initial explosive stages
of magnetic island mergers of magnetic flux tubes produced in the bulk of
nebula at intermediate polar regions. The post-termination shock plasma flow in
the wind sectors with mild magnetization naturally generates large-scale highly
magnetized structures. Internal kink-like instabilities lead to the formation
of macroscopic current-carrying magnetic flux tubes that merge explosively.

groups over the past 3 Gyr. We are using the largest multi-wavelength sample
to-date, comprised 1770 groups (containing 7417 galaxies), in the redshift
range of 0.01<z<0.23. To derive the physical properties of the galaxies we rely
on ultraviolet (UV)-to-infrared spectral energy distribution modeling, using
CIGALE. Our results suggest that during the 3 Gyr period covered by our sample,
the star formation activity of galaxies in our groups has been substantially
reduced (3-10 times). Moreover, their star formation histories as well as their
UV-optical and mid-infrared colors are significantly different from those of
field and cluster galaxies, indicating that compact group galaxies spend more
time transitioning through the green valley. The morphological transformation
from late-type spirals into early-type galaxies occurs in the mid-infrared
transition zone rather than in the UV-optical green valley. We find evidence of
shocks in the emission line ratios and gas velocity dispersions of the
late-type galaxies located below the star forming main sequence. Our results
suggest that in addition to gas stripping, turbulence and shocks might play an
important role in suppressing the star formation in compact group galaxies.

explanation, in spite of recent progress made, for example, on the occasional
presence of a thermal component in the spectrum along with the ubiquitous
non-thermal component that is modelled with a Band function. The combination of
finite duration and aperiodic modulations make GRBs hard to characterise
temporally. Although correlations between GRB luminosity and spectral hardness
on one side and time variability on the other side have long been known, the
loose and often arbitrary definition of the latter makes the interpretation
uncertain. We characterise the temporal variability in an objective way and
search for a connection with rest-frame spectral properties for a number of
well-observed GRBs. We studied the individual power density spectra (PDS) of
123 long gamma-ray bursts with measured redshift, rest-frame peak energy Ep,i
of the time-averaged nuFnu spectrum, and well-constrained PDS slope alpha
detected with Swift, Fermi and past spacecraft. The PDS were modelled with a
power law either with or without a break adopting a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo technique. We find a highly significant Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation. The
null hypothesis probability is ~ 10^-9. In the framework of the internal shock
synchrotron model, the Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation can hardly be reconciled
with the predicted Ep,i propto Gamma^-2, unless either variable microphysical
parameters of the shocks or continual electron acceleration are assumed.
Alternatively, in the context of models based on magnetic reconnection, the PDS
slope and Ep,i are linked to the ejecta magnetisation at the dissipation site,
so that more magnetised outflows would produce more variable GRB light curves
at short timescales (<= 1 s), shallower PDS, and higher values of Ep,i.

relativistic astrophysical jets, yet their physical origin is still not well
understood. Here, we employ a suite of large-scale two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations in electron-positron plasmas to demonstrate that
relativistic magnetic reconnection can naturally account for the formation of
quasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic
fields. Our simulations extend to unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial
scales, so we can capture the asymptotic physics independently of the initial
setup. We characterize the properties of the plasmoids that are continuously
generated as a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process: they are
in rough energy equipartition between particles and magnetic fields; the upper
energy cutoff of the plasmoid particle spectrum is proportional to the plasmoid
width w, corresponding to a Larmor radius ~0.2 w; the plasmoids grow in size at
~0.1 of the speed of light, with most of the growth happening while they are
still non-relativistic (first they grow); their growth is suppressed once they
get accelerated to relativistic speeds by the field line tension, up to the
Alfven speed (then they go). The largest plasmoids, whose typical recurrence
interval is ~2.5 L/c, reach a characteristic size w ~ 0.2 L independently of
the system length L, they have nearly isotropic particle distributions and they
contain the highest energy particles, whose Larmor radius is ~0.03 L. The
latter can be regarded as the Hillas criterion for relativistic reconnection.

stellar mass is clearly detected with M_star/L_K = 0.61 +/- 0.11 solar,
consistent with stellar population synthesis models for a Milky-Way IMF. We
obtain a halo concentration, c_200 =8.4 +/- 1.0, and virial mass, M_200 = 7.9
+/- 0.6 x 10^13 M_sun. For its mass, the inferred concentration is larger than
most relaxed halos produced in cosmological simulations with Planck parameters,
consistent with RXJ1159+5531 forming earlier than the general halo population.
The baryon fraction at r_200, f_b,200 = 0.134 +/- 0.007, is slightly below the

associated with non-central galaxies and the uncertain intracluster light,
f_b,200 increases by ~0.015, consistent with the cosmic value. Performing our
analysis in the context of MOND still requires a large DM fraction (85.0% +/-
2.5% at r=100 kpc) similar to that obtained using the standard Newtonian
approach. The detection of a plausible stellar BCG mass component distinct from
the NFW DM halo in the total gravitational potential suggests that ~10^14 M_sun
represents the mass scale above which dissipation is unimportant in the
formation of the central regions of galaxy clusters. (Abridged)

pressure anomalies in the horizontal and vertical directions. For a range of
Rossby number ($-0.5 < Ro < 0.5$) and Burger number ($0.02 < Bu < 2.3$)
relevant to observed long-lived vortices, the growth rate and spatial structure
of the most unstable eigenmodes have been numerically calculated and presented
as a function of $Ro-Bu$. We have found neutrally-stable vortices only over a
small region of the $Ro-Bu$ parameter space: cyclones with $Ro \sim 0.02-0.05$
and $Bu \sim 0.85-0.95$. However, we have also found that anticyclones in
general have slower growth rates compared to cyclones. In particular, the
growth rate of the most unstable eigenmode for anticyclones in a large region
of the parameter space (e.g., $Ro<0$ and $0.5 \lesssim Bu \lesssim 1.3$) is
slower than $50$ turn-around times of the vortex (which often corresponds to
several years for ocean eddies). For cyclones, the region with such slow growth
rates is confined to $0<Ro<0.1$ and $0.5 \lesssim Bu \lesssim 1.3$. While most
calculations have been done for $f/\bar{N}=0.1$ (where $f$ and $\bar{N}$ are

numerically verified and explained analytically, using non-dimensionalized

are seen in situations more representative of astrophysical flows. In the
turbulence simulations, the Powell cleaning scheme artificially grows the mean
magnetic field, while CT maintains this conserved quantity of ideal MHD. In the
disc simulation, CT gives slower magnetic field growth rate and saturates to
equipartition between the turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic energy, whereas
Powell cleaning produces a dynamically dominant magnetic field. Such difference
has been observed in adaptive-mesh refinement codes with CT and
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics codes with divergence-cleaning. In the
cosmological simulation, both approaches give similar magnetic amplification,
but Powell exhibits more cell-level noise. CT methods in general are more
accurate than divergence-cleaning techniques, and, when coupled to a moving
mesh can exploit the advantages of automatic spatial/temporal adaptivity and
reduced advection errors, allowing for improved astrophysical MHD simulations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02714v2,Simulating the dust content of galaxies: successes and failures,"  We present full volume cosmological simulations using the moving-mesh code
AREPO to study the coevolution of dust and galaxies. We extend the dust model
in AREPO to include thermal sputtering of grains and investigate the evolution
of the dust mass function, the cosmic distribution of dust beyond the
interstellar medium, and the dependence of dust-to-stellar mass ratio on
galactic properties. The simulated dust mass function is well-described by a
Schechter fit and lies closest to observations at $z = 0$. The radial scaling
of projected dust surface density out to distances of $10 \, \text{Mpc}$ around
galaxies with magnitudes $17 < i < 21$ is similar to that seen in Sloan Digital
Sky Survey data, albeit with a lower normalisation. At $z = 0$, the predicted
dust density of $\Omega_\text{dust} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-6}$ lies in the
range of $\Omega_\text{dust}$ values seen in low-redshift observations. We find
that dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass for galaxies
living along the star formation main sequence. Moreover, we estimate the $850
\, \mu\text{m}$ number density functions for simulated galaxies and analyse the
relation between dust-to-stellar flux and mass ratios at $z = 0$. At high
redshift, our model fails to produce enough dust-rich galaxies, and this
tension is not alleviated by adopting a top-heavy initial mass function. We do
not capture a decline in $\Omega_\text{dust}$ from $z = 2$ to $z = 0$, which
suggests that dust production mechanisms more strongly dependent on star
formation may help to produce the observed number of dusty galaxies near the
peak of cosmic star formation.

  Holes at High Redshifts","  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by single or binary supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) brighten galactic nuclei and reveal a population of
otherwise dormant black holes. Adopting event rates from the literature, we aim
to establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the TDE number counts
and their observable signals. We pay particular attention to two types of TDEs
which are expected to be observable out to high redshifts, namely (i) jetted
TDEs whose luminosity is boosted by relativistic beaming, and (ii) TDEs around
binary black holes. We show that the brightest (jetted) TDEs are expected to be
produced by massive black hole binaries if the occupancy of intermediate mass
black holes (IMBHs) in low mass galaxies is high. The same binary population
will also provide gravitational wave sources for eLISA. In addition, we find
that the shape of the X-ray luminosity function of TDEs strongly depends on the
occupancy of IMBHs and could be used to constrain scenarios of SMBH formation.
Finally, we make predictions for the expected number of TDEs observed by future
X-ray telescopes as a function of their sensitivity limits. We find that an
instrument which is 50 times more sensitive than the Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT) on board the Swift satellite is expected to trigger ~10 times more events
than BAT with 50% of the events coming from z>2. Because of their long decay
times, high-redshift TDEs can be mistaken for fixed point sources in deep field
surveys such as the 4Ms survey with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and targeted
observations of the same deep field with year-long intervals could reveal TDEs.
If the occupation fraction of IMBHs is high, 6-20 TDEs are expected in each

strong lenses discovered in the SINFONI Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey
(SNELLS). Based on their lensing masses, these ETGs were inferred to have a
stellar initial mass function (IMF) consistent with that of the Milky Way, not
the bottom-heavy IMF that has been reported as typical for high-$\sigma$ ETGs
based on lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis techniques. We
use these unique systems to test the consistency of IMF estimates derived from
different methods. We first estimate the stellar $M_*/L$ using lensing and
stellar dynamics. We then fit high-quality optical spectra of the lenses using
an updated version of the stellar population synthesis models developed by
Conroy & van Dokkum. When examined individually, we find good agreement among
these methods for one galaxy. The other two galaxies show 2-3$\sigma$ tension
with lensing estimates, depending on the dark matter contribution, when
considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 Msol. Allowing a variable low-mass cutoff
or a nonparametric form of the IMF reduces the tension among the IMF estimates
to $<2\sigma$. There is moderate evidence for a reduced number of low-mass
stars in the SNELLS spectra, but no such evidence in a composite spectrum of
matched-$\sigma$ ETGs drawn from the SDSS. Such variation in the form of the
IMF at low stellar masses (m <~ 0.03 Msol), if present, could reconcile
lensing/dynamical and spectroscopic IMF estimates for the SNELLS lenses and
account for their lighter $M_*/L$ relative to the mean matched-$\sigma$ ETG. We
provide the spectra used in this study to facilitate future comparisons.

  for neural circuit reconstruction using FFT signal whitening","  The detailed reconstruction of neural anatomy for connectomics studies
requires a combination of resolution and large three-dimensional data capture
provided by serial section electron microscopy (ssEM). The convergence of high
throughput ssEM imaging and improved tissue preparation methods now allows ssEM
capture of complete specimen volumes up to cubic millimeter scale. The
resulting multi-terabyte image sets span thousands of serial sections and must
be precisely registered into coherent volumetric forms in which neural circuits
can be traced and segmented. This paper introduces a Signal Whitening Fourier
Transform Image Registration approach (SWiFT-IR) under development at the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and its use to align mouse and zebrafish brain
datasets acquired using the wafer mapper ssEM imaging technology recently
developed at Harvard University. Unlike other methods now used for ssEM
registration, SWiFT-IR modifies its spatial frequency response during image
matching to maximize a signal-to-noise measure used as its primary indicator of
alignment quality. This alignment signal is more robust to rapid variations in
biological content and unavoidable data distortions than either phase-only or
standard Pearson correlation, thus allowing more precise alignment and
statistical confidence. These improvements in turn enable an iterative
registration procedure based on projections through multiple sections rather
than more typical adjacent-pair matching methods. This projection approach,
when coupled with known anatomical constraints and iteratively applied in a
multi-resolution pyramid fashion, drives the alignment into a smooth form that
properly represents complex and widely varying anatomical content such as the
full cross-section zebrafish data.

OBe/OB stars to be 13% down to this limit, and by investigating this fraction
as a function of the brightness of the stars we deduce that H{\alpha} excess
peaks at the O9-B2 spectral range. Using the most up-to-date numbers of SMC

the fundamental issues in developing a streaming analytical workflow for
analyzing the continuous arrival of multiple, unbounded transit data feeds for
automatically processing and enriching them with additional information
containing higher level concepts accordingly to a particular mobility context.
This workflow consists of three tasks: (1) stream data retrieval for creating
time windows; (2) data cleaning for handling missing data, overlap data or
redundant data; and (3) data contextualization for computing actual arrival and
departure times as well as the stops and moves during a bus trip, and also
performing mobility context computation. The workflow was implemented in a
Hadoop cloud ecosystem using data streams from the CODIAC Transit System of the
city of Moncton, NB. The Map() function of MapReduce is used to retrieve and
bundle data streams into numerous clusters which are subsequently handled in a
parallel manner by the Reduce() function in order to execute the data
contextualization step. The results validate the need for cloud computing for
achieving high performance and scalability, however, due to the delay in

be deployed using a cloud environment, paving the way to combine it with fog

magnetohydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO
employing an updated Illustris galaxy formation model. Here we focus on the
general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy
clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is
closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation
amplifies the initial seed fields ($10^{-14}$ comoving Gauss) to the values
observed in low-redshift galaxies ($1-10\,\mu{\rm G}$). The magnetic field
topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields
are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are
present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution
of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of $280$
clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of $1.1\times 10^{7}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$, and generate mock observations for VLA, LOFAR, ASKAP and SKA. Our
simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates
with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between
total radio power and X-ray emission, $M_{500}$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
$Y_{\rm 500}$ parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our
most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma
and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes
as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different
instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations,
but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic

information about the enrichment history and formation of galaxy clusters. Here
we explore the metal content of clusters in IllustrisTNG - a new suite of
galaxy formation simulations building on the Illustris project. Our cluster
sample contains 20 objects in TNG100 - a ~(100 Mpc)^3 volume simulation with
2x1820^3 resolution elements, and 370 objects in TNG300 - a ~(300 Mpc)^3 volume
simulation with 2x2500^3 resolution elements. The z=0 metallicity profiles
agree with observations, and the enrichment history is consistent with
observational data going beyond z~1, showing nearly no metallicity evolution.
The abundance profiles vary only minimally within the cluster samples,
especially in the outskirts with a relative scatter of ~15%. The average
metallicity profile flattens towards the center, where we find a logarithmic
slope of -0.1 compared to -0.5 in the outskirts. Cool core clusters have more
centrally peaked metallicity profiles (~0.8 solar) compared to non-cool core
systems (~0.5 solar), similar to observational trends. Si/Fe and O/Fe radial
profiles follow positive gradients. The outer abundance profiles do not evolve
below z~2, whereas the inner profiles flatten towards z=0. More than ~80% of

Galactic center, provide a unique setting for the investigation of magnetic
reconnection. Here, protons are non-relativistic while electrons can be
ultra-relativistic. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations,
we investigate electron and proton heating in the outflows of
trans-relativistic reconnection (i.e., $\sigma_w\sim 0.1-1$, where the
magnetization $\sigma_w$ is the ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy
density). For both electrons and protons, we find that heating at high
$\beta_{\rm i}$ (here, $\beta_{\rm i}$ is the ratio of proton thermal pressure
to magnetic pressure) is dominated by adiabatic compression ('adiabatic
heating'), while at low $\beta_{\rm i}$ it is accompanied by a genuine increase
in entropy ('irreversible heating'). For our fiducial $\sigma_w=0.1$, the
irreversible heating efficiency at $\beta_{\rm i}\lesssim 1$ is nearly
independent of the electron-to-proton temperature ratio $T_{\rm e}/T_{\rm i}$
(which we vary from $0.1$ up to $1$), and it asymptotes to $\sim 2\%$ of the
inflowing magnetic energy in the low-$\beta_{\rm i}$ limit. Protons are heated
more efficiently than electrons at low and moderate $\beta_{\rm i}$ (by a
factor of $\sim7$), whereas the electron and proton heating efficiencies become
comparable at $\beta_{\rm i}\sim 2$ if $T_{\rm e}/T_{\rm i}=1$, when both
species start already relativistically hot. We find comparable heating
efficiencies between the two species also in the limit of relativistic
reconnection ($\sigma_w\gtrsim 1$). Our results have important implications for
the two-temperature nature of collisionless accretion flows, and may provide
the sub-grid physics needed in general relativistic MHD simulations.

  the Standard $Λ\mathrm{CDM}$ + Halo Model","  Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can
elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately,
the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models
statistically. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small
scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo
connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the
""accurate"" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful
treatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling
approach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional
two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard
$\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies.
Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity
function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model
fits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding
group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly
tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the
adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the
cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried
(Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity
galaxies, but exhibits a 2.3$\sigma$ tension with the clustering of luminous
galaxies, thus providing evidence that the ""standard"" halo model needs to be
extended. This work opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo
model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.

CellNet) with results conforming to experimentally validated biological data.
Based on these results we introduce a conceptual framework, a model-based
interventional calculus and a reprogrammability measure with which to steer,
manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics of non- linear dynamical systems from
partial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and
applying a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate
how its algorithmic information content is affected when every one of its
elements are perturbed. The approach represents an alternative to numerical
simulation and statistical approaches for inferring causal
mechanistic/generative models and finding first principles. We demonstrate the
framework's capabilities by reconstructing the phase space of some discrete
dynamical systems (cellular automata) as case study and reconstructing their
generating rules. We thus advance tools for reprogramming artificial and living
systems without full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic
equations or probability distributions yielding a suite of universal and
parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability ranging from causation,
dimension reduction, feature selection and model generation.

  on chameleon gravity tests","  We present a systematic comparison of several existing and new void finding
algorithms, focusing on their potential power to test a particular class of
modified gravity models - chameleon $f(R)$ gravity. These models deviate from
standard General Relativity (GR) more strongly in low-density regions and thus
voids are a promising venue to test them. We use Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) prescriptions to populate haloes with galaxies, and tune the HOD
parameters such that the galaxy two-point correlation functions are the same in
both f(R) and GR models. We identify both 3D voids as well as 2D underdensities
in the plane-of-the-sky to find the same void abundance and void galaxy number
density profiles across all models, which suggests that they do not contain
much information beyond galaxy clustering. However, the underlying void dark
matter density profiles are significantly different, with f(R) voids being more
underdense than GR ones, which leads to f(R) voids having a larger tangential
shear signal than their GR analogues. We investigate the potential of each void
finder to test f(R) models with near-future lensing surveys such as EUCLID and
LSST. The 2D voids have the largest power to probe f(R) gravity, with a LSST
analysis of tunnel (which is a new type of 2D underdensity introduced here)

with $|f_{R0}|=10^{-5}$ and $10^{-6}$ from GR.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02145v2,MOSFiT: Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients,"  Much of the progress made in time-domain astronomy is accomplished by
relating observational multi-wavelength time series data to models derived from
our understanding of physical laws. This goal is typically accomplished by
dividing the task in two: collecting data (observing), and constructing models
to represent that data (theorizing). Owing to the natural tendency for
specialization, a disconnect can develop between the best available theories
and the best available data, potentially delaying advances in our understanding
new classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open-Source Fitter
for Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient datasets from
open online catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo
ensembles of semi-analytical light curve fits to those datasets and their
associated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally delivers the fitting
results back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the
community. MOSFiT is designed to help bridge the gap between observations and
theory in time-domain astronomy; in addition to making the application of
existing models and creation of new models as simple as possible, MOSFiT yields
statistically robust predictions for transient characteristics, with a standard
output format that includes all the setup information necessary to reproduce a
given result. As large-scale surveys such as LSST discover entirely new classes
of transients, tools such as MOSFiT will be critical for enabling rapid
comparison of models against data in statistically consistent, reproducible,
and scientifically beneficial ways.

archival photometry and new optical/near-IR imaging and spectroscopy, together

with subsequent exponential decline leading to a low current star formation
rate of 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which we convert into a binary merger
timescale probability distribution. We find a median merger timescale of
$11.2^{+0.7}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, with a 90% confidence range of $6.8-13.6$ Gyr. This
in turn indicates an initial binary separation of $\approx 4.5$ R$_{\odot}$,
comparable to the inferred values for Galactic BNS systems. We also use new and

the optical counterpart of $2.1$ kpc (0.64$r_{e}$) from the center of NGC 4993

http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08420v2,A census of cool core galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG,"  The thermodynamic structure of hot gas in galaxy clusters is sensitive to
astrophysical processes and typically difficult to model with galaxy formation
simulations. We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large
sample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC
definitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the
extremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the
criteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the
CC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed
fractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result
is partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed
gas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative
agreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the
simulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs
appears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the
fraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are
more relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting
CCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC
criteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is
dependent on the CC criteria. We conclude that the thermodynamic structure of
galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG shares many similarities with observations, but
achieving better agreement most likely requires modifications of the underlying
galaxy formation model.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10170v3,"The fraction of dark matter within galaxies from the IllustrisTNG
  simulations","  We use the IllustrisTNG (TNG) cosmological simulations to provide theoretical
expectations for the dark matter mass fractions (DMFs) and circular velocity
profiles of galaxies. TNG predicts flat circular velocity curves for $z = 0$
Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies beyond a few kpc from the galaxy centre, in better
agreement with observational constraints than its predecessor, Illustris. TNG
also predicts an enhancement of the dark matter mass within the 3D stellar
half-mass radius ($r_\mathrm{half}$; $M_\mathrm{200c} =
10^{10}-10^{13}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, $z \le2$) compared to its dark matter only
and Illustris counterparts. This enhancement leads TNG present-day galaxies to
be dominated by dark matter within their inner regions, with
$f_\mathrm{DM}(<r_\mathrm{half})\gtrsim0.5$ at all masses and with a minimum
for MW-mass galaxies. The 1$\sigma$ scatter is $\lesssim$ 10~per~cent at all
apertures, which is smaller than that inferred by some observational datasets,
e.g. 40 per cent from the SLUGGS survey. TNG agrees with the majority of the
observationally inferred values for elliptical galaxies once a consistent IMF
is adopted (Chabrier) and the DMFs are measured within the same apertures. The
DMFs measured within $r_\mathrm{half}$ increase towards lower redshifts: this
evolution is dominated by the increase in galaxy size with time. At $z\sim2$,
the DMF in disc-like TNG galaxies decreases with increasing galaxy mass, with
$f_\mathrm{DM}(<r_\mathrm{half}) \sim 0.10-0.65$ for $10^{10} \lesssim M_{\rm
stars}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{12}$, and are two times higher than if
TNG galaxies resided in Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter haloes unaffected by
baryonic physics. It remains to be properly assessed whether recent
observational estimates of the DMFs at $z\sim2$ rule out the contraction of the
dark matter haloes predicted by the TNG model.

  galaxies","  The (re)ionisation of hydrogen in the early universe has a profound effect on
the formation of the first galaxies: by raising the gas temperature and
pressure, it prevents gas from cooling into small haloes thus affecting the
abundance of present-day small galaxies. Using the Galform semi-analytic model
of galaxy formation, we show that two key aspects of the reionisation process
-- when reionisation takes place and the characteristic scale below which it
suppresses galaxy formation -- are imprinted in the luminosity function of
dwarf galaxies. We focus on the luminosity function of satellites of galaxies
like the Milky Way and the LMC, which is easier to measure than the luminosity
function of the dwarf population as a whole. Our results show that the details
of these two characteristic properties of reionisation determine the shape of
the luminosity distribution of satellites in a unique way, and is largely
independent of the other details of the galaxy formation model. Our models
generically predict a bimodality in the distribution of satellites as a
function of luminosity: a population of faint satellites and population of
bright satellites separated by a 'valley' forged by reionisation. We show that
this bimodal distribution is present at high statistical significance in the
combined satellite luminosity function of the Milky Way and M31. We make
predictions for the expected number of satellites around LMC-mass dwarfs where
the bimodality may also be measurable in future observational programmes. Our
preferred model predicts a total of $26 \pm 10$ (68 per cent confidence)
satellites brighter than ${\rm M}_V=0$ in LMC-mass systems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10179v3,Revisiting hypervelocity stars after Gaia DR2,"  Hypervelocity stars are intriguing rare objects traveling at speeds large
enough to be unbound from the Milky Way. Several mechanisms have been proposed
for producing them, including the interaction of the Galaxy's super-massive
black hole (SMBH) with a binary; rapid mass-loss from a companion to a star in
a short-period binary; the tidal disruption of an infalling galaxy and finally
ejection from the Large Magellanic Cloud. While previously discovered
high-velocity early-type stars are thought to be the result of an interaction
with the SMBH, the origin of high-velocity late type stars is ambiguous. The
second data release of Gaia (DR2) enables a unique opportunity to resolve this
ambiguity and determine whether any late-type candidates are truly unbound from
the Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize the new proper motion and velocity
information available from DR2 to re-evaluate a collection of historical data
compiled on the newly-created Open Fast Stars Catalog. We find that almost all
previously-known high-velocity late-type stars are most likely bound to the
Milky Way. Only one late-type object (LAMOST J115209.12+120258.0) is unbound
from the Galaxy. Performing integrations of orbital histories, we find that
this object cannot have been ejected from the Galactic centre and thus may be
either debris from the disruption of a satellite galaxy or a disc runaway.

Additionally, the inclusion of ATC yields a flatter CC fraction redshift
evolution, easing the tension with the observed evolution. With ATC included,
the energy required for the central black hole to achieve self-regulation is
reduced and the gas fraction in the cluster core increases, resulting in larger
CC fractions. ATC makes the ICM unstable to perturbations and the increased
efficiency of AGN feedback suggests that its inclusion results in a greater
level of mixing in the ICM. Therefore, ATC is potentially an important physical
process in reproducing the thermal structure of the ICM.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07372v1,"The Type I Superluminous Supernova PS16aqv: Lightcurve Complexity and
  Deep Limits on Radioactive Ejecta in a Fast Event","  [Abridged] We present UV/optical observations of PS16aqv (SN 2016ard), a Type
I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) classified as part of our search for low-$z$
SLSNe. PS16aqv is a fast evolving SLSNe-I that reached a peak absolute
magnitude of $M_{r} \approx -22.1$. The lightcurves exhibit a significant
undulation at 30 rest-frame days after peak, with a behavior similar to
undulations seen in the slowly fading SLSN-I SN 2015bn. This similarity
strengthens the case that fast and slow SLSNe-I form a continuum with a common
origin. At $\approx\!80$ days after peak, the lightcurves exhibit a transition
to a slow decline, followed by significant subsequent steepening, indicative of
a plateau phase or a second significant undulation. Deep limits at $\approx280$
days after peak imply a tight constraint on the nickel mass, $M_{\rm Ni}
\lesssim 0.35$ M$_{\odot}$ (lower than for previous SLSNe-I), and indicate that
some SLSNe-I do not produce significantly more nickel than normal Type Ic SNe.
Using MOSFiT, we model the lightcurve with a magnetar central engine model and
find $P_{\rm spin} \approx 0.9$ ms, $B \approx 1.5 \times 10^{14}$ G, and
$M_{\rm ej} \approx 16$ M$_{\odot}$. The implied rapid spin-down time and large
reservoir of available energy coupled with the high ejecta mass may account for
the fast evolving lightcurve and slow spectroscopic evolution. We also study
the location of PS16aqv in its host galaxy and find that it occurred at an
offset of $2.46 \pm 0.21$ kpc from the central star-forming region. We find the
host galaxy exhibits low metallicity and spatially varying extinction and star
formation rate, with the explosion site exhibiting lower values than the
central region. The complexity seen in the lightcurves of PS16aqv and other
events highlights the importance of obtaining well-sampled lightcurves for
exploring deviations from a uniform decline.

by dividing them into two groups in terms of the expansion velocity inferred
from the absorption minimum of the Si II 6355 line in their spectra near B-band
maximum brightness. One group (""Normal"") consists of normal SNe Ia populating a
narrow strip in the Si II velocity distribution, with an average expansion
velocity v=10,600+/-400 km/s near B maximum; the other group (""HV"") consists of
objects with higher velocities, v > 11,800 km/s. Compared with the Normal
group, the HV one shows a narrower distribution in both the peak luminosity and
the luminosity decline rate dm_{15}. In particular, their B-V colors at maximum
brightness are found to be on average redder by ~0.1, suggesting that they
either are associated with dusty environments or have intrinsically red B-V
colors. The HV SNe Ia are also found to prefer a lower extinction ratio Rv~1.6

(<110Mpc) study of optically selected, isolated, Lstar elliptical galaxies, to
provide an X-ray census of galaxy-scale (virial mass, Mvir < 1e13 Msun)
objects, and identify candidates for detailed hydrostatic mass modelling. In
this paper, we present a Chandra and XMM study of one such candidate, NGC1521,
and constrain its distribution of dark and baryonic matter. We find a
morphologically relaxed hot gas halo, extending almost to R500, that is well
described by hydrostatic models similar to the benchmark, baryonically closed,
Milky Way-mass elliptical galaxy NGC720. We obtain good constraints on the
enclosed gravitating mass (M500=3.8e12+/-1e12 Msun, slightly higher than
NGC\thin 720), and baryon fraction (fb500=0.13+/-0.03). We confirm at 8.2-sigma
the presence of a dark matter (DM) halo consistent with LCDM. Assuming a
Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, our self-consistent, physical model enables
meaningful constraints beyond R500, revealing that most of the baryons are in
the hot gas. Within the virial radius, fb is consistent with the Cosmic mean,
suggesting that the predicted massive, quasi-hydrostatic gas halos may be more
common than previously thought. We confirm that the DM and stars conspire to
produce an approximately powerlaw total mass profile (rho \propto r^-alpha)
that follows the recently discovered scaling relation between alpha and optical
effective radius. Our conclusions are insensitive to modest, observationally
motivated, deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. Finally, after correcting
for the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profile is close to the self-similar
prediction of gravitational structure formation simulations, as observed in
massive galaxy clusters.

longer as a supramassive neutron star before collapsing to a black hole if,
indeed, it collapses at all. During this process, a fraction of the magnetar's
rotational energy of ~10^53 erg is transferred via magnetic spin-down to the
surrounding ejecta. The resulting interaction between the ejecta and the
surrounding circumburst medium powers a >year-long synchrotron radio transient.
We present a search for radio emission with the Very Large Array following nine
short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at rest-frame times of ~1.3-7.6 years
after the bursts, focusing on those events which exhibit early-time excess
X-ray emission that may signify the presence of magnetars. We place upper
limits of <18-32 microJy on the 6.0 GHz radio emission, corresponding to
spectral luminosities of <(0.05-8.3)x10^39 erg s^-1. Comparing these limits to
the predicted radio emission from a long-lived remnant and incorporating
measurements of the circumburst densities from broad-band modeling of short GRB
afterglows, we rule out a stable magnetar with an energy of 10^53 erg for half
of the events in our sample. A supramassive remnant that injects a lower
rotational energy of 10^52 erg is ruled out for a single event, GRB 050724A.

distances, then their all-sky rate implies that the Milky Way may host an FRB
on average once every 30-1500 years. If FRBs repeat for decades or centuies, a
local FRB could be active now. A typical Galactic FRB would produce a

and record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a
central data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all
participants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from
an astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times
reported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,
potentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating
at diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield
the dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within
the Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz

$\rho$ Ophiuchi A. The star has exhibited strong X-ray variability: a
cusp-shaped increase of rate, similar to that which we partially observed in
2013, and a bright flare. These events are separated in time by about 104 ks,
which likely corresponds to the rotational period of the star (1.2 days). Time
resolved spectroscopy of the X-ray spectra shows that the first event is caused
by an increase of the plasma emission measure, while the second increase of
rate is a major flare with temperatures in excess of 60 MK ($kT\sim5$ keV).
From the analysis of its rise, we infer a magnetic field of $\ge300$ G and a
size of the flaring region of $\sim1.4-1.9\times10^{11}$ cm, which corresponds
to $\sim25\%-30\%$ of the stellar radius. We speculate that either an intrinsic
magnetism that produces a hot spot on its surface or an unknown low mass
companion are the source of such X-rays and variability. A hot spot of magnetic
origin should be a stable structure over a time span of $\ge$2.5 years, and
suggests an overall large scale dipolar magnetic field that produces an
extended feature on the stellar surface. In the second scenario, a low mass
unknown companion is the emitter of X-rays and it should orbit extremely close
to the surface of the primary in a locked spin-orbit configuration, almost on
the verge of collapsing onto the primary. As such, the X-ray activity of the
secondary star would be enhanced by its young age, and the tight orbit as in RS
Cvn systems and $\rho$ Ophiuchi would constitute an extreme system that is
worthy of further investigation.

occurred at the nucleus of a known Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy hosting a
10$^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole. The transient was previously claimed to be a Type
IIn SLSN due to its luminosity and hydrogen emission lines. The light curve
shows that PS16dtm brightened by about two magnitudes in ~50 days relative to
the archival host brightness and then exhibited a plateau phase for about 100
days followed by the onset of fading in the UV. During the plateau PS16dtm
showed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of 1.7 x 10$^4$
K, and radiated at approximately $L_{Edd}$ of the SMBH. The spectra exhibit
multi-component hydrogen emission lines and strong FeII emission, show little
evolution with time, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being
distinct from those of Type IIn SNe. Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the
X-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of
its host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity
associated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with a SN origin or any
known form of AGN variability, and therefore we argue that it is a TDE in which
the accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and
excitation of the pre-existing broad line region, while providing material that
obscures the X-ray emitting region of the pre-existing AGN accretion disk. A
detailed TDE model fit to the light curve indicates that PS16dtm will remain
bright for several years; we further predict that the X-ray emission will
reappear on a similar timescale as the accretion rate declines. Finally, we
place PS16dtm in the context of other TDEs and find that TDEs in AGN galaxies
are an order of magnitude more efficient and reach Eddington luminosities,

http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04327v2,"The Immitigable Nature of Assembly Bias: The Impact of Halo Definition
  on Assembly Bias","  Dark matter halo clustering depends not only on halo mass, but also on other
properties such as concentration and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as
assembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly bias on halo definition,
parametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\Delta$. We summarize the
strength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a
function of halo mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering
depends strongly on mass at all $\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions
($\Delta \sim 200\mathrm{m}-600\mathrm{m}$), concentration-dependent clustering
at low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through
interactions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can
be greatly reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\Delta \sim
20\mathrm{m}-40\mathrm{m}$ for haloes with $M_{200\mathrm{m}} \lesssim
10^{12}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Smaller $\Delta$ implies larger radii and
mitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called backsplash
haloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}
\gtrsim 10^{13}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) larger overdensities, $\Delta
\gtrsim 600\mathrm{m}$, are necessary. Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are
significant for all halo definitions that we explore and exhibit a relatively
weaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly
bias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common
definitions. We identify no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations
of assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates assembly bias based on one
halo property (e.g., concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo
definitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not
coincide with the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05845v2,"Galaxy Formation with BECDM: I. Turbulence and relaxation of idealised
  haloes","  We present a theoretical analysis of some unexplored aspects of relaxed
Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter (BECDM) haloes. This type of ultralight
bosonic scalar field dark matter is a viable alternative to the standard cold
dark matter (CDM) paradigm, as it makes the same large-scale predictions as CDM
and potentially overcomes CDM's small-scale problems via a galaxy-scale de
Broglie wavelength. We simulate BECDM halo formation through mergers, evolved
under the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations. The formed haloes consist of a
soliton core supported against gravitational collapse by the quantum pressure
tensor and an asymptotic $r^{-3}$ NFW-like profile. We find a fundamental
relation of the core=to-halo mass with the dimensionless invariant $\Xi \equiv
\lvert E \rvert/M^3/(Gm/\hbar)^2$ or $M_{\rm c}/M \simeq 2.6 \Xi^{1/3}$,
linking the soliton to global halo properties. For $r \geq 3.5 \,r_{\rm c}$
core radii, we find equipartition between potential, classical kinetic, and
quantum gradient energies. The haloes also exhibit a conspicuous turbulent
behavior driven by the continuous reconnection of vortex lines due to wave
interference. We analyse the turbulence 1D velocity power spectrum and find a
$k^{-1.1}$ power-law. This suggests the vorticity in BECDM haloes is
homogeneous, similar to thermally-driven counterflow BEC systems from condensed
matter physics, in contrast to a $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov power-law seen in
mechanically-driven quantum systems. The mode where the power spectrum peaks is
approximately the soliton width, implying the soliton-sized granules carry most
of the turbulent energy in BECDM haloes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08476v1,Galactic Sources Detected in the NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey,"  The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) provides an improvement in
sensitivity at energies above 10 keV by two orders of magnitude over
non-focusing satellites, making it possible to probe deeper into the Galaxy and
Universe. Lansbury and collaborators recently completed a catalog of 497
sources serendipitously detected in the 3-24 keV band using 13 deg2 of NuSTAR
coverage. Here, we report on an optical and X-ray study of 16 Galactic sources
in the catalog. We identify eight of them as stars (but some or all could have
binary companions), and use information from Gaia to report distances and X-ray
luminosities for three of them. There are four CVs or CV candidates, and we
argue that NuSTAR J233426-2343.9 is a relatively strong CV candidate based
partly on an X-ray spectrum from XMM-Newton. NuSTAR J092418-3142.2, which is
the brightest serendipitous source in the Lansbury catalog, and NuSTAR
J073959-3147.8 are LMXB candidates, but it is also possible that these two
sources are CVs. One of the sources is a known HMXB, and NuSTAR J105008-5958.8
is a new HMXB candidate, which has strong Balmer emission lines in its optical
spectrum and a hard X-ray spectrum. We discuss the implications of finding
these HMXBs for the surface density (logN-logS) and luminosity function of
Galactic HMXBs. We conclude that, with the large fraction of unclassified
sources in the Galactic plane detected by NuSTAR in the 8-24 keV band, there
could be a significant population of low luminosity HMXBs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00399v3,"Counterfactual Explanations without Opening the Black Box: Automated
  Decisions and the GDPR","  There has been much discussion of the right to explanation in the EU General
Data Protection Regulation, and its existence, merits, and disadvantages.
Implementing a right to explanation that opens the black box of algorithmic
decision-making faces major legal and technical barriers. Explaining the
functionality of complex algorithmic decision-making systems and their
rationale in specific cases is a technically challenging problem. Some
explanations may offer little meaningful information to data subjects, raising
questions around their value. Explanations of automated decisions need not
hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function.
Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued,
explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box.
Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than
merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations
according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support. From the
perspective of individuals affected by automated decision-making, we propose
three aims for explanations: (1) to inform and help the individual understand
why a particular decision was reached, (2) to provide grounds to contest the
decision if the outcome is undesired, and (3) to understand what would need to
change in order to receive a desired result in the future, based on the current
decision-making model. We assess how each of these goals finds support in the
GDPR. We suggest data controllers should offer a particular type of
explanation, unconditional counterfactual explanations, to support these three
aims. These counterfactual explanations describe the smallest change to the
world that can be made to obtain a desirable outcome, or to arrive at the
closest possible world, without needing to explain the internal logic of the
system.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05261v1,The evolution of the mass-metallicity relation in IllustrisTNG,"  The coevolution of galaxies and their metal content serves as an important
test for galaxy feedback models. We analyze the distribution and evolution of
metals within the IllustrisTNG simulation suite with a focus on the gas-phase
mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that the IllustrisTNG model broadly
reproduces the slope and normalization evolution of the MZR across the redshift
range $0<z<2$ and mass range $10^9 < M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot < 10^{10.5}$. We make
predictions for the high redshift ($2<z<10$) metal content of galaxies which is
described by a gradual decline in the normalization of the metallicity with an
average high redshift ($z>2$) evolution fit by $\mathrm{d\;log(Z)}/\mathrm{dz}
\approx - 0.064$. Our simulations indicate that the metal retention efficiency
of the interstellar medium (ISM) is low: a majority of gas-phase metals ($\sim$
85 per cent at $z=0$) live outside of the ISM, either in an extended gas disk,
the circumgalactic medium, or outside the halo. Nevertheless, the redshift
evolution in the simulated MZR normalization is driven by the higher gas
fractions of high redshift galaxies, not by changes to the metal retention
efficiency. The scatter in the simulated MZR contains a clear correlation with
the gas-mass or star formation rate of the system, in agreement with the
observed fundamental metallicity relation. The scatter in the MZR is driven by
a competition between periods of enrichment- and accretion-dominated
metallicity evolution. We expect that while the normalization of the MZR
declines with redshift, the strength of the correlation between metallicity and
gas-mass at fixed stellar mass is not a strong function of redshift. Our
results indicate that the ""regulator"" style models are best suited for
simultaneously explaining the shape, redshift evolution, and existence of
correlated scatter with gas fraction about the MZR.

$Spitzer$-IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m imaging, archival optical imaging, and
the prospector fully Bayesian SED fitting framework. Our sample contains one
field UDG (DGSAT I), one Virgo cluster UDG (VCC 1287), and one Virgo cluster
dwarf elliptical for comparison (VCC 1122). We find that the optical--NIR
colors of the three galaxies are significantly different from each other. We
infer that VCC 1287 has an old ($\gtrsim7.7$ Gyr) and surprisingly metal-poor
($[Z/Z_{\odot}]\lesssim-1.0$) stellar population, even after marginalizing over
uncertainties on diffuse interstellar dust. In contrast, the field UDG DGSAT I
shows evidence of being younger than the Virgo UDG, with an extended star
formation history and an age posterior extending down to $\sim3$ Gyr. The
stellar metallicity of DGSAT I is sub-solar but higher than that of the Virgo
UDG, with $[Z/Z_{\odot}]=-0.63^{+0.35}_{-0.62}$; in the case of exactly zero
diffuse interstellar dust, DGSAT I may even have solar metallicity. With VCC
1287 and several Coma UDGs, a general picture is emerging where cluster UDGs
may be ""failed"" galaxies, but the field UDG DGSAT I seems more consistent with
a stellar feedback-induced expansion scenario. In the future, our approach can
be applied to a large and diverse sample of UDGs down to faint surface
brightness limits, with the goal of constraining their stellar ages, stellar
metallicities, and circumstellar and diffuse interstellar dust content.

framework that alleviates the small-scale CDM challenges within the Local

simulations (a 36~Mpc$^3$ volume with gas cell mass of
$\sim10^5\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and minimum gas softening of $\sim180$~pc) within
ETHOS to date -- plus a CDM counterpart -- to quantify the abundance of
galaxies at high redshift and their impact on reionization. We find that ETHOS
predicts galaxies with higher ultraviolet (UV) luminosities than their CDM
counterparts and a faster build-up of the faint end of the UV luminosity
function. These effects, however, make the optical depth to reionization less
sensitive to the power spectrum cut-off: the ETHOS model differs from the CDM
$\tau$ value by only 10 per cent and is consistent with Planck limits if the

release 9 to provide first epoch photometry for objects in the Gaia source

all phase space coordinates within a heliocentric distance of $\sim 10$ kpc. We
devise a method to assess the significance of halo substructures based on their
clustering in velocity space. The two most substantial structures are multiple
wraps of a stream which has undergone considerable phase mixing (S1, with 94
members) and a kinematically cold stream (S2, with 61 members). The member
stars of S1 have a median position of ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.12, -0.22, 2.75$) kpc and
a median metallicity of [Fe/H] $= -1.78$. The stars of S2 have median
coordinates ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.66, 0.30, 0.77$) kpc and a median metallicity of
[Fe/H] $= -1.91$. They lie in velocity space close to some of the stars in the
stream reported by Helmi et al. (1999). By modelling, we estimate that both
structures had progenitors with virial masses $\approx 10^{10} M_\odot$ and
infall times $\gtrsim 9$ Gyr ago. Using abundance matching, these correspond to
stellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^7 M_\odot$. These are somewhat larger
than the masses inferred through the mass-metallicity relation by factors of 5
to 15. Additionally, we identify two further substructures (S3 and S4 with 55
and 40 members) and two clusters or moving groups (C1 and C2 with 24 and 12)
members. In all 6 cases, clustering in kinematics is found to correspond to
clustering in both configuration space and metallicity, adding credence to the

obtained in [5, 6] for the anisotropic Calder{\'o}n problem at fixed frequency,
in dimension n $\ge$ 3, when the Dirichlet and Neumann data are measured on
disjoint subsets of the boundary. These non-uniqueness results are of the
following nature: given a smooth compact connected Riemannian manifold with
boundary (M, g) of dimension n $\ge$ 3, we first show that there exist in the
conformal class of g an infinite number of Riemannian metrics gmetrics metrics
g such that their corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps at a fixed frequency
coincide when the Dirichlet data $\Gamma$D and Neumann data $\Gamma$N are
measured on disjoint sets and satisfy $\Gamma$D $\cup$ $\Gamma$N = $\partial$M.
The corresponding conformal factors satisfy a nonlinear elliptic PDE of Yamabe
type on (M, g) and arise from a natural but subtle gauge invariance of the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04425v2,Stellar and nebular diagnostics in the UV for star-forming galaxies,"  There is a long history of using optical emission and absorption lines to
constrain the metallicity and ionization parameters of gas in galaxies.
However, comparable diagnostics are less well-developed for the UV. Here, we
assess the diagnostic potential of both absorption and emission features in the
UV and evaluate the diagnostics against observations of local and high redshift
galaxies. We use the CloudyFSPS nebular emission model of Byler et al. 2017,
extended to include emission predictions in the UV, to evaluate the metallicity
sensitivity of established UV stellar absorption indices, and to identify those
that include a significant contribution from nebular emission. We present model
UV emission line fluxes as a function of metallicity and ionization parameter,
assuming both instantaneous bursts and constant SFRs. We identify combinations
of strong emission lines that constrain metallicity and ionization parameter,
including [CIII] 1907, CIII] 1909, OIII] 1661,1666, SiIII]1883,1892, CIV
1548,1551, NII] 1750,1752, and MgII 2796, and develop UV versions of the
canonical ""BPT"" diagram. We quantify the relative contribution from stellar
wind emission and nebular line emission to diagnostic line ratios that include
the CIV 1548,1551 lines, and also develop an observationally motivated
relationship for N and C enrichment that improves the performance of
photoionization models. We summarize the best diagnostic choices and the
associated redshift range for low-, mid-, and high-resolution rest-UV
spectroscopy in preparation for the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10045v1,Kinetic Compressive Sensing,"  Parametric images provide insight into the spatial distribution of
physiological parameters, but they are often extremely noisy, due to low SNR of
tomographic data. Direct estimation from projections allows accurate noise
modeling, improving the results of post-reconstruction fitting. We propose a
method, which we name kinetic compressive sensing (KCS), based on a
hierarchical Bayesian model and on a novel reconstruction algorithm, that
encodes sparsity of kinetic parameters. Parametric maps are reconstructed by
maximizing the joint probability, with an Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM)
approach, alternating the optimization of activity time series (OS-MAP-OSL),
and kinetic parameters (MAP-LM). We evaluated the proposed algorithm on a
simulated dynamic phantom: a bias/variance study confirmed how direct estimates
can improve the quality of parametric maps over a post-reconstruction fitting,
and showed how the novel sparsity prior can further reduce their variance,
without affecting bias. Real FDG PET human brain data (Siemens mMR, 40min)
images were also processed. Results enforced how the proposed KCS-regularized
direct method can produce spatially coherent images and parametric maps, with
lower spatial noise and better tissue contrast. A GPU-based open source
implementation of the algorithm is provided.

images that elucidate, on linear size scales of $\sim$30--40 AU, the chemical
structure of the nearby, evolved, protoplanetary disk orbiting the close binary
system V4046 Sgr. The observations were undertaken in the 1.1--1.4 mm
wavelength range (ALMA Bands 6 and 7) with antenna configurations involving
maximum baselines of several hundred meters, yielding subarcsecond-resolution
images in more than a dozen molecular species and isotopologues. Isotopologues
of CO and HCN display centrally peaked morphologies of integrated emission line
intensity, whereas the line emission from complex nitrile group molecules
(HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN), deuterated molecules (DCN, DCO$^+$), hydrocarbons (as
traced by C$_2$H), and potential CO ice line tracers (N$_2$H$^+$, and H$_2$CO)
appears as a sequence of sharp and diffuse rings. The dimensions and
morphologies of HC$_3$N and CH$_3$CN emission are suggestive of photodesorption
of organic ices from the surfaces of dust grains, while the sequence of
increasing radius of peak intensity represented by DCN (smallest), DCO$^+$,
N$_2$H$^+$, and H$_2$CO (largest) is qualitatively consistent with the expected
decline of midplane gas temperature with increasing disk radius. Empirical
modeling indicates that the sharp-edged C$_2$H emission ring lies at relatively
deep disk layers, leaving open the question of the origin of C$_2$H abundance
enhancements in evolved disks. This study of the ""molecular anatomy"" of V4046
Sgr should serve as motivation for additional subarcsecond ALMA molecular line

  prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy","  We present a full-scale clinical prototype system for in vivo range
verification of proton pencil-beams using the prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy
method. The detection system consists of eight LaBr3 scintillators and a
tungsten collimator, mounted on a rotating frame. Custom electronics and
calibration algorithms have been developed for the measurement of energy- and
time-resolved gamma-ray spectra during proton irradiation at a clinical dose
rate. Using experimentally determined nuclear reaction cross sections and a
GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation, a detailed model of the expected
gamma-ray emissions is created for each individual pencil-beam. The absolute
range of the proton pencil-beams is determined by minimizing the discrepancy
between the measurement and this model, leaving the absolute range of the beam
and the elemental concentrations of the irradiated matter as free parameters.
The system was characterized in a clinical-like situation by irradiating
different phantoms with a scanning pencil-beam. A dose of 0.9 Gy was delivered
to a 5x10x10 cm^3 target with a beam current of 2 nA incident on the phantom.
Different range shifters and materials were used to test the robustness of the
verification method and to calculate the accuracy of the detected range. The
absolute proton range was determined for each spot of the distal energy layer
with a mean statistical precision of 1.1 mm at a 95% confidence level and a
mean systematic deviation of 0.5 mm, when aggregating pencil-beam spots within
a cylindrical region of 10 mm radius and 10 mm depth. Small range errors that
we introduced were successfully detected and even large differences in the
elemental composition do not affect the range verification accuracy. These
results show that our system is suitable for range verification during patient
treatments in our upcoming clinical study.

independently measured from two broad lines (H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ or Mg${\rm
\,II}$) without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Here in the
third paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch
spectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning
$\sim$5--15 yr in the quasars' rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the
broad H$\beta$ calibrated against [O${\rm\,III}]\,\lambda 5007$ suggests that 5
of the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H$\beta$ RV
curves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant
changes in the broad line profiles. Their broad H$\alpha$ (or Mg${\rm \,II}$)
lines display RV shifts that are either consistent with or smaller than those
seen in broad H$\beta$. The RV shifts can be explained by a $\sim$0.05--0.1 pc
BSBH with an orbital period of $\sim$40--130 yr, assuming a mass ratio of
0.5--2 and a circular orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained
given the few epochs that sample only a small portion of the hypothesized
binary orbital cycle. The apparent occurrence rate of sub-pc BSBHs is

{\it Spitzer}, we confirmed that two protostellar candidates in Oph-A are bona
fide protostars or proto-brown dwarfs (proto-BDs) in extremely early
evolutionary stages. Both objects are barely visible across infrared (IR, i.e.,
near-IR to far-IR) bands. The physical nature of the cores is very similar to
that expected in first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs), objects theoretically
predicted in the evolutionary phase prior to stellar core formation with gas
densities of $\sim$ 10$^{11-12}$ cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that the evolutionary
stage is close to the FHSC formation phase. The two objects are associated with
faint X-ray sources, suggesting that they are in very early phase of stellar
core formation with magnetic activity. In addition, we found the CO outflow
components around both sources which may originate from the young outflows
driven by these sources. The masses of these objects are calculated to be $\sim
0.01-0.03$ $M_\odot$ from the dust continuum emission. Their physical
properties are consistent with that expected from the numerical model of
forming brown dwarfs. These facts (the X-ray detection, CO outflow association,
and FHSC-like spectral energy distributions) strongly indicate that the two
objects are proto-BDs or will be in the very early phase of protostars which
will evolve more massive protostars if they gain enough mass from the
surroundings. The ages of these two objects are likely to be within $\sim 10^3$
years after the protostellar core (or second core) formation, taking into
account the outflow dynamical times ($\lesssim$ 500 yrs).

  Vainshtein screening using weak lensing","  We study cosmic voids in the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP)
braneworld models, which are representative of a class of modified gravity
theories where deviations from General Relativity are usually hidden by the
Vainshtein screening in high-density environments. This screening is less
efficient away from these environments, which makes voids ideally suited for
testing this class of models. We use N-body simulations of $\Lambda$-cold dark
matter ($\Lambda$CDM) and nGDP universes, where dark matter haloes are
populated with mock galaxies that mimic the clustering and number densities of
the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample. We measure the force, density and weak lensing
profiles around voids identified with six different algorithms. Compared to
$\Lambda$CDM, voids in nDGP are more under-dense due to the action of the fifth
force that arises in these models, which leads to a faster evacuation of matter
from voids. This leaves an imprint on the weak lensing tangential shear profile
around nDGP voids, an effect that is particularly strong for 2D underdensities
that are identified in the plane-of-the-sky. We make predictions for the
feasibility of distinguishing between nDGP and $\Lambda$CDM using void lensing
in upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST and Euclid. We compare with the
analysis of voids in chameleon gravity theories and find that the weak lensing
signal for 3D voids is similar to nDGP, whereas for 2D voids the differences

  star J1407 with photographic plates","  Context. The 16 Myr old star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent
a series of complex eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the transit of a giant
Hill sphere filling debris ring system around a secondary companion, J1407b. No
other eclipses have since been detected, although other measurements have
constrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding
another eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the
system, the geometry of the proposed ring system and enable planning of further
observations to characterize the material within these putative rings. Aims. We
carry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of J1407 with the aim
of constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods. We present photometry
from archival photographic plates from the Harvard DASCH survey, and Bamberg
and Sonneberg Observatories, in order to place additional constraints on the
orbital period of J1407b by searching for other dimming and eclipse events.
Using a visual inspection of all 387 plates and a period-folding algorithm we
performed a search for other eclipses in these data sets. Results. We find no
other deep eclipses in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent
time-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions. We rule out a large
fraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 years. These
limits are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere filling ring
system surrounding a brown dwarf companion in a bound elliptical orbit about
J1407. Issues with the stability of any rings combined with the lack of
detection of another eclipse, suggests that J1407b may not be bound to J1407.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10824v1,Lyman Continuum Observations of Solar Flares Using SDO/EVE,"  The Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment was designed to observe the
Sun-as-a-star in the extreme ultraviolet; a wavelength range that has remained
spectrally unresolved for many years. It has provided a wealth of data on solar
flares, perhaps most uniquely, on the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen at high
cadence and moderate spectral resolution. In this paper we concentrate on the
analysis of Lyman continuum (LyC) observations and its temporal evolution in a
sample of six major solar flares. By fitting both the pre-flare and flare
excess spectra with a blackbody function we show that the color temperature
derived from the slope of LyC reveals temperatures in excess of 10$^{4}$ K in
the six events studied; an increase of a few thousand Kelvin above quiet-Sun
values (typically $\sim$8000-9500 K). This was found to be as high as 17000 K
for the 2017 September 6 X9.3 flare. Using these temperature values, and
assuming a flaring area of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{2}$, estimates of the departure
coefficient of hydrogen, $b_1$, were calculated. It was found that $b_1$
decreased from 10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ in the quiet-Sun, to around unity during the
flares. This implies that LyC is optically thick and formed in local
thermodynamic equilibrium during flares. It also emanates from a relatively
thin ($\lesssim$100 km) shell formed at deeper, denser layers than in the
quiescent solar atmosphere. We show that in terms of temporal coverage and
resolution, EVE gives a more comprehensive picture of the response of the
chromosphere to the flare energy input with respect to those of the
Skylab/Harvard College Observatory spatially resolved observations of the
1970's.

(SLSN-I) SN2017dwh at $z\!\approx\!0.13$, which reached $M_{i}\!\approx\!-21$
mag at peak. Spectra taken a few days after peak show an unusual and strong
absorption line centered near 3200\AA\ that we identify with Co II, suggesting
a high fraction of synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the ejecta. By $\sim\!1$ month
after peak, SN2017dwh became much redder than other SLSNe-I, instead strongly
resembling broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (Ic-BL SNe) with clear suppression of
the flux redward of $\sim\!5000$ \AA, providing further evidence for a large
mass of Fe-group elements. Late-time upper limits indicate a $^{56}$Ni mass of
$\lesssim 0.6$ M$_\odot$, leaving open the possibility that SN2017dwh produced
a $^{56}$Ni mass comparable to SN1998bw ($\approx\!0.4$ M$_\odot$). Fitting the
light curve with a combined magnetar and $^{56}$Ni model using ${\tt MOSFiT}$,
we find that the light curve can easily accommodate such masses without
affecting the inferred magnetar parameters. We also find that SN2017dwh
occurred in the least-luminous detected host galaxy to date for a SLSN-I, with
$M_{B} = -13.5$ mag and an implied metallicity of $Z\!\sim\!0.08$ $Z_\odot$.
The spectral properties of SN2017dwh provide new evidence linking SLSNe-I with
Type Ic-BL SNe, and in particular the high Fe-group abundance may be due to
enhanced $^{56}$Ni production or mixing due to asphericity. Finally, we find
that SN2017dwh represents the most extreme end of a correlation between
continuum shape and Co II absorption strength in the near-peak spectra of
SLSNe-I, indicating that Fe-group abundance likely accounts for some of the
variation in their spectral shapes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00731v2,The age of secrecy and unfairness in recidivism prediction,"  In our current society, secret algorithms make important decisions about
individuals. There has been substantial discussion about whether these
algorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is
complex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of
fairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the
focus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to
meet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a
result, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading
descriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can
easily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a
recidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system
-- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age,
despite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by
subtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show
that COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's
analysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions
about a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked
without careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the
first place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in
this work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score
but long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur
frequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies
a different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and
the public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations
behind risk scores for recidivism.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01139v1,"Weak Lensing Reveals a Tight Connection Between Dark Matter Halo Mass
  and the Distribution of Stellar Mass in Massive Galaxies","  Using deep images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and taking
advantage of its unprecedented weak lensing capabilities, we reveal a
remarkably tight connection between the stellar mass distribution of massive
central galaxies and their host dark matter halo mass. Massive galaxies with
more extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark
matter haloes. We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that
assumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar
content in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in-situ and ex-situ mass at
$r<10$ kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description
of the stellar mass functions (SMF) of total stellar mass ($M_{\star}^{\rm
Max}$) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc ($M_{\star}^{10}$) and also
reproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different
stellar mass distributions. The best-fit model shows that halo mass varies
significantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear
dependence on $M_{\star}^{10}$. Our two-parameter $M_{\star}^{\rm
Max}$-$M_{\star}^{10}$ description provides a more accurate picture of the
galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass
relation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of halos
with those of central galaxies. The model also predicts that the ex-situ
component dominates the mass profiles of galaxies at $r< 10$ kpc for $\log
M_{\star} \ge 11.7$). The code used for this paper is available online:

challenging due to the wide range of physical processes affecting the dust
evolution. Here we present cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a cluster
of galaxies, $M_\text{200,crit}=6 \times 10^{14}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, including a
novel dust model for the moving mesh code {\sc Arepo}. This model includes dust
production, growth, supernova-shock-driven destruction, ion-collision-driven
thermal sputtering, and high temperature dust cooling through far infrared
re-radiation of collisionally deposited electron energies. Adopting a rather
low thermal sputtering rate, we find, consistent with observations, a
present-day overall dust-to-gas ratio of $\sim 2\times 10^{-5}$, a total dust
mass of $\sim 2\times 10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$, and a dust mass fraction of $\sim
3\times 10^{-6}$. The typical thermal sputtering timescales within $\sim
100\,{\rm kpc}$ are around $\sim 10\,{\rm Myr}$, and increase towards the outer
parts of the cluster to $\sim 10^3\,{\rm Myr}$ at a cluster-centric distance of
$1\,{\rm Mpc}$. The condensation of gas phase metals into dust grains reduces
high temperature metal-line cooling, but also leads to additional dust infrared
cooling. The additional infrared cooling changes the overall cooling rate in
the outer parts of the cluster, beyond $\sim 1\,{\rm Mpc}$, by factors of a
few. This results in noticeable changes of the entropy, temperature, and
density profiles of cluster gas once dust formation is included. The emitted
dust infrared emission due to dust cooling is consistent with observational
constraints.

  field","  Identifying the source population of ionizing radiation, responsible for the
reionization of the universe, is currently a hotly debated subject with
conflicting results. Studies of faint, high-redshift star-forming galaxies, in
most cases, fail to detect enough escaping ionizing radiation to sustain the
process. Recently, the capacity of bright quasi-stellar objects to ionize their
surrounding medium has been confirmed also for faint active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), which were found to display an escaping fraction of ~74% at z~4. Such
levels of escaping radiation could sustain the required UV background, given
the number density of faint AGNs is adequate. Thus, it is mandatory to
accurately measure the luminosity function of faint AGNs (L~L*) in the same
redshift range. For this reason we have conducted a spectroscopic survey, using
the wide field spectrograph IMACS at the 6.5m Baade Telescope, to determine the
nature of our sample of faint AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This sample
was assembled using photometric redshifts, color, and X-ray information. We
ended up with 16 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs at 3.6<z<4.2 down to a
magnitude of i$_{AB}$=23.0 for an area of 1.73 deg$^{2}$. This leads to an AGN
space density of ~1.6$\times10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}$ (corrected) at z~4 for an
absolute magnitude of M$_{1450}$=-23.5. This is higher than previous
measurements and seems to indicate that AGNs could make a substantial
contribution to the ionizing background at z~4. Assuming that AGN physical
parameters remain unchanged at higher redshifts and fainter luminosities, these
sources could be regarded as the main drivers of cosmic reionization.

robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the dynamic mechanism
and the fundamental structure to achieve these properties in the cell-cycle
process of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the budding
yeast cell-cycle process behaves like an excitable system containing three
well-coupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis
events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be separated into G1/S
phase module, early M module and late M phase module, where the positive
feedbacks in each module and the interactions among the modules play important
role. If the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the
saddle-node bifurcations, there is a critical slowing down or ghost effect.
This can provide the cell-cycle process with a sufficient duration for each
event and an attractive manifold for the state checking of the completion of
DNA replication and mitosis; moreover, the fluctuation in the early
module/event is forbidden to transmit to the latter module/event. Our results
suggest both a fundamental structure of cell-cycle regulatory network and a
hint for the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes, from the dynamic
checking mechanism to the molecule checkpoint pathway.

fast radiative cooling of low-entropy gas at the centers of galaxy clusters and
for reducing star formation rates of central ellipticals. The details of
self-regulation depend critically on the unknown contents of AGN-inflated
bubbles. Observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal of AGN bubbles
provide us with the ability to directly measure the lobe electron pressure
given a bubble morphology. Here we compute the SZ signal of jet-inflated
bubbles in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy
cluster MS0735.6+7421 with the Arepo code, and compare our synthetic SZ results
to inferences obtained with popular modelling approaches. We find that cutting
out ellipsoidal bubbles from a double-beta pressure profile only matches the
inner bubble edges in the simulations and fails to account for the emission of
the shock-enhanced pressure cocoon outside the bubbles. This additional
contribution significantly worsens the accuracy of the cut-out method for jets
with small inclinations with respect to the line of sight. Also, the kinetic SZ
effect of the bubbles, a previously neglected contribution, becomes relevant at
these smaller inclinations due to entrainment and mixing of the intracluster
medium with low-density jet material. Fortunately, the different signs of the
kinetic SZ signal in opposite lobes allow modelling this effect. We present an
approximate method to determine the jet inclination, which combines jet power
and lifetime estimates, the stand-off distance between jet head and bow shock,

using cosmological simulations and 6-dimensional Gaia data. Our approach is to
use our knowledge of the assembly history and phase-space distribution of halo
stars to constrain the form of the high velocity tail of the stellar halo.
Using simple analytical models and cosmological simulations, we find that the
shape of the high velocity tail is strongly dependent on the velocity
anisotropy and number density profile of the halo stars --- highly eccentric
orbits and/or shallow density profiles have more extended high velocity tails.
The halo stars in the solar vicinity are known to have a strongly radial
velocity anisotropy, and it has recently been shown the origin of these highly
eccentric orbits is the early accretion of a massive (M_star ~ 10^9 M_Sun)
dwarf satellite. We use this knowledge to construct a prior on the shape of the
high velocity tail. Moreover, we use the simulations to define an appropriate
outer boundary of 2r_200, beyond which stars can escape. After applying our
methodology to the Gaia data, we find a local (r_0=8.3 kpc) escape speed of
v_esc(r_0) = 528(+24,-25) km/s. We use our measurement of the escape velocity

increasing $B_{\rm g}/B_0$. As a result, for large $B_{\rm g} /B_{0}$,
electrons receive the overwhelming majority of irreversible particle heating
(${\sim}93\%$ for $B_{\rm g} /B_{0}=6$). This is significantly different than
the antiparallel case $B_{\rm g}/B_0=0$, in which electron irreversible heating
accounts for only ${\sim}18\%$ of the total particle heating. At $\beta_{\rm i}
\sim 2$, when both species start already relativistically hot (for our fiducial
$\sigma_w=0.1$), electrons and protons each receive ${\sim}50\%$ of the
irreversible particle heating, regardless of the guide field strength. Our
results provide important insights into the plasma physics of electron and
proton heating in hot accretion flows around supermassive black holes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10455v2,"The Stellar-to-Halo Mass Ratios of Passive and Star-Forming Galaxies at
  z~2-3 from the SMUVS survey","  In this work, we use measurements of galaxy stellar mass and two-point
angular correlation functions to constrain the stellar-to-halo mass ratios
(SHMRs) of passive and \np\ galaxies at $z\sim2-3$, as identified in the
\emph{Spitzer} Matching Survey of the UltraVISTA ultra-deep Stripes (SMUVS). We
adopt a sophisticated halo modeling approach to statistically divide our two
populations into central and satellite galaxies. For central galaxies, we find
that the normalization of the SHMR is greater for our passive population.
Through the modeling of $\Lambda$ cold dark matter halo mass accretion
histories, we show that this can only arise if the conversion of baryons into
stars was more efficient at higher redshifts and additionally that passive
galaxies can be plausibly explained as residing in halos with the highest
formation redshifts (i.e., those with the lowest accretion rates) at a given
halo mass. At a fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies occupy host halos with a
greater mass than central galaxies, and we find further that the fraction of
passive galaxies that are satellites is higher than for the combined
population. This, and our derived satellite quenching timescales, combined with
earlier estimates from the literature, support dynamical/environmental
mechanisms as the dominant process for satellite quenching at $z\lesssim3$.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00963v1,Improvement of Simplified Models of Variability of Stars: A review,"  Astronomical data are typically irregular in time, e.g. the space
(HIPPARCOS/TYCHO, KEPLER, GAIA, WISE etc.) and ground-based CCD (NSVS, ASAS,
CRTS, SuperWASP etc.) and photographic (Harvard, Sonneberg, Odessa etc.)
photometrical surveys. This leads to cancellation of the conditions, which lead
to the orthogonality of the basic functions, and thus the simplified methods
give biased parameters of the approximations. We have elaborated a series of
algorithms and programs for statistically correct analysis, and have applied
them to 2000+ variable stars of different types. The data were obtained from an
international collaboration in a frame of the ""Inter-Longitude Astronomy"" (ILA)
campaign. Some highlights of our studies are presented, with an extended list
of our original publications. The main improvements were done: 1) for the
periodogram analysis - the parameters are determined from a complete set of
equations containing the (algebraic polynomial) trend superimposed on the
(multi-) harmonic wave, so no ""detrending"", no ""prewhitening"" are used; 2) for
the approximations - we use additional (multi-) harmonic waves, and also
""special shapes"" (patterns) for parts of the light curve, which correspond to
relatively fast changes (minima of the eclipsing binaries, minima and maxima
for the pulsating variables); 3) ""auto correlation analysis"" (ACF) - taking
into account the bias due to a trend removal (previously - only a subtraction
of the sample mean was taken into account); ACF for the irregularly spaced
data; 4) for the signals with bad coherence, the ""scalegram"" analysis is
proposed, which allows to estimate a characteristic cycle length and the
amplitude, as well as to provide a realistic approximation; 5) the extension of
the Morlet-type wavelet for more periodic signals and 6) ""running"" (parabola,

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02584v1,"Probing the Cosmological Evolution of Super-massive Black Holes using
  Tidal Disruption Flares","  The question of how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow over cosmic time is
a major puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. One promising approach to this
problem is via the study of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). These are transient
events resulting from the disruption of stars by quiescent supermassive black
holes at centers of galaxies. A meter-class X-ray observatory with a time
resolution $\sim$ a millisecond and a spectral resolution of a few eV at KeV
energies would be revolutionary as it will facilitate high signal to noise
spectral-timing studies of several cosmological TDFs. It would open a new era
of astrophysics where SMBHs in TDFs at cosmic distances can be studied in
similar detail as current studies of much nearer, stellar-mass black hole
binaries. Using Athena X-ray observatory as an example, we highlight two
specific aspects of spectral-timing analysis of TDFs. (1) Detection of X-ray
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) over a redshift range and using these signal
frequencies to constrain the spin evolution of SMBHs, and (2) Time-resolved
spectroscopy of outflows/winds to probe super-Eddington accretion. SMBH spin
distributions at various redshifts will directly allow us to constrain their
primary mode of growth as higher spins are predicted due to spin-up for
prolonged accretion-mode growth, while lower spins are expected for growth via
mergers due to angular momentum being deposited from random directions. A
meter-class X-ray telescope will also be able to characterize relativistic
TDFs, viz., SwJ1644+57-like events, out to a redshift greater than 8, i.e., it
would facilitate detailed spectral-timing studies of TDFs by the youngest SMBHs
in the Universe.

connection have significantly advanced our understanding of galaxy evolution.
Past techniques have focused on connections between halo properties and galaxy
stellar mass and/or star formation rates. Empirical techniques in the next
decade will link halo assembly histories with galaxies' circumgalactic media,
supermassive black holes, morphologies, kinematics, sizes, colors,
metallicities, and transient rates. Uncovering these links will resolve many
critical uncertainties in galaxy formation and will enable much higher-fidelity
mock catalogs essential for interpreting observations. Achieving these results
will require broader and deeper spectroscopic coverage of galaxies and their
circumgalactic media; survey teams will also need to meet several criteria
(cross-comparisons, public access, and covariance matrices) to facilitate
combining data across different surveys. Acting on these recommendations will
continue enabling dramatic progress in both empirical modeling and galaxy

  Epoch with Lyman-alpha","  The epoch of reionization (6 < z < 10) marks the period in our universe when
the first large galaxies grew to fruition, and began to affect the universe
around them. Massive stars, and potentially accreting supermassive black holes,
filled the universe with ionizing radiation, burning off the haze of neutral
gas that had filled the intergalactic medium (IGM) since recombination
(z~1000). The evolution of this process constrains key properties of these
earliest luminous sources, thus observationally constraining reionization is a
key science goal for the next decade. The measurement of Lyman-alpha emission
from photometrically-identified galaxies is a highly constraining probe of
reionization, as a neutral IGM will resonantly scatter these photons, reducing
detectability. While significant work has been done with 8-10m telescopes,
these observations require extremely large telescopes (ELTs); the flux limits
available from today's 10m class telescopes are sufficient for only the
brightest known galaxies (m < 26). Ultra-deep surveys with the Giant Magellan
Telescope (GMT) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will be capable of detecting
Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies 2-3 magnitudes fainter than today's deepest
surveys. Wide-field fiber spectroscopy on the GMT combined with narrow-field
AO-assisted slit spectroscopy on the TMT will be able to probe the expected
size of ionized bubbles throughout the epoch of reionization, following up
degree scale deep imaging surveys with the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope.
These data will provide the first resolved Lyman-alpha-based maps of the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04742v1,Testing the Nature of Dark Matter with Extremely Large Telescopes,"  For nearly 40 years, dark matter has been widely assumed to be cold and
collisionless. Cold dark matter models make fundamental predictions for the
behavior of dark matter on small (<10 kpc) scales. These predictions include
cuspy density profiles at the centers of dark matter halos and a halo mass
function that increases as dN/dM ~ M^-1.9 down to very small masses. We suggest
two observational programs relying on extremely large telescopes to critically
test these predictions, and thus shed new light on the nature of dark matter.
(1) Combining adaptive optics-enabled imaging with deep spectroscopy to measure
the three-dimensional motions of stars within a sample of Local Group dwarf
galaxies that are the cleanest dark matter laboratories known in the nearby
universe. From these observations the inner slope of the dark matter density
profile can be determined with an accuracy of 0.20 dex, enabling a central cusp
to be distinguished from a core at 5 sigma significance. (2)
Diffraction-limited AO imaging and integral field spectroscopy of
gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars to quantify the abundance of dark
substructures in the halos of the lens galaxies and along the line of sight.
Observations of 50 lensed arcs and 50 multiply-imaged quasars will be
sufficient to measure the halo mass function over the range 10^7 < M < 10^10
Msun at cosmological scales, independent of the baryonic and stellar
composition of those structures. These two observational probes provide
complementary information about the small scale structure, with a joint
self-consistent analysis mitigating limitations of either probe. This program
will produce the strongest existing constraints on the properties of dark
matter on small scales, allowing conclusive tests of alternative warm, fuzzy,
and self-interacting dark matter models.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06711v2,"The detached, evolved post-mass-exchange binary V643 Orionis","  Context: One of the greatest uncertainties in modelling the mass-exchange
phases during the evolution of a binary system is the amount of mass and
angular momentum that has been lost from the system. To constrain this problem,
a favourable, evolved and detached real binary system is valuable as an example
of the end result of this process. Aims: We study the 52-day post-mass-exchange
eclipsing binary V643 Ori from complete uvby light curves and high-resolution
spectra. V643 Ori is a double-lined, circular orbit, synchronized binary
showing total primary eclipses. Results: We determine accurate masses of 3.3
and 1.9 M(Sun) and radii of 16 and 21 R(Sun). The masses and radii are
incompatible with undisturbed post-main-sequence evolution. Conclusions: We
have attempted to simulate the past evolutionary history of V643 Ori under both
conservative and non-conservative Case B mass transfer scenarios. In the
non-conservative case we varied the amounts of mass and angular momentum loss
needed to arrive at the present masses in a circular 52-day orbit, keeping the
two stars detached and synchronized as now observed, but without following the
evolution of other stellar properties in any detail. Multiple possible
solutions were found. Further attempts were made using both the BSE formalism
and the binary MESA code in order to track stellar evolution more closely, and
make use of the measured radii and temperatures as important additional
constraints. Those efforts did not yield satisfactory solutions, possibly due
to limitations in handling mass transfer in evolved stars such as these. We
remain hopeful that future theoreticians can more fully model the system under
realistic conditions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09645v1,Probing IGM accretion onto faint Lyα emitters at z~2.8,"  (abridged) Observing the signature of accretion from the intergalactic medium
(IGM) onto galaxies at z~3 requires the detection of faint (L<<L*) galaxies
embedded in a filamentary matrix of low-density, metal-poor gas coherent over
hundreds of kpc. We study the gaseous environment of three Lyman$\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) at z=2.7-2.8, found to be aligned in projection with a
background QSO over ~250 kpc along the slit of a long-slit spectrum. The lack
of detection of the LAEs in deep continuum images and the low inferred
Ly$\alpha$ luminosities show the LAEs to be intrinsically faint, low-mass
galaxies (L<0.1 L*, M_star< 0.1 M*). An echelle spectrum of the QSO reveals
strong Ly-alpha absorption within $\pm200$ km/s from the LAEs. Our absorption
line analysis leads to HI column densities in the range of log N(HI) =16-18.
Associated absorption from ionic metal species CIV and SiIV constrains the gas
metallicities to ~0.01 solar if the gas is optically thin, and possibly as low
as ~0.001 solar if the gas is optically thick, assuming photoionization
equilibrium. While the inferred metallicities are at least a factor of ten
lower than expected metallicities in the interstellar medium (ISM) of these
LAEs, they are consistent with the observed chemical enrichment level in the
IGM at the same epoch. Total metal abundances and kinematic arguments suggest
that these faint galaxies have not been able to affect the properties of their
surrounding gas. The projected spatial alignment of the LAEs, together with the
kinematic quiescence and correspondence between the LAEs and absorbing gas in
velocity space suggests that these observations probe a possible filamentary
structure. Taken together with the blue-dominant Ly$\alpha$ emission line
profile of one of the objects, the evidence suggests that the absorbing gas is
part of an accretion stream of low-metallicity gas in the IGM.

color-magnitude diagram (pCMD) technique for measuring star formation histories
(SFHs) and other stellar population parameters of galaxies, and demonstrate
that the technique can also constrain distances. SFHs have previously been
measured through either the modeling of resolved-star CMDs or of
integrated-light SEDs, yet neither approach can easily be applied to galaxies
in the ""semi-resolved regime"". The pCMD technique has previously been shown to
have the potential to measure stellar populations and star formation histories
in semi-resolved galaxies. Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with
Python (pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational
improvements to the original code and including more realistic physical models.
These advances include the simultaneous fitting of distance, modeling a
Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated
dust model. GPU-acceleration allows these more realistic models to be fit
roughly 7x faster than the simpler models in the original code. We present
results from a suite of mock tests, showing that with proper model assumptions,
the code can simultaneously recover SFH, [Fe/H], distance, and dust extinction.
Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution,
should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be
applied to systems out to as far as 100 Mpc. pCMDs open a new window to
studying the stellar populations of many galaxies that cannot be readily

  check, and additional evidence","  Overshooting from the convective cores of stars more massive than about 1.2
M(Sun) has a profound impact on their subsequent evolution. And yet, the
formulation of the overshooting mechanism in current stellar evolution models
has a free parameter (f[ov] in the diffusive approximation) that remains poorly
constrained by observations, affecting the determination of astrophysically
important quantities such as stellar ages. In an earlier series of papers we
assembled a sample of 37 well-measured detached eclipsing binaries to calibrate
the dependence of f[ov] on stellar mass, showing that it increases sharply up
to a mass of roughly 2 M(Sun), and remains constant thereafter out to at least
4.4 M(Sun). Recent claims have challenged the utility of eclipsing binaries for
this purpose, on the basis that the uncertainties in f[ov] from the model fits
are typically too large to be useful, casting doubt on a dependence of
overshooting on mass. Here we reexamine those claims and show them to be too
pessimistic, mainly because they did not account for all available constraints
--- both observational and theoretical --- in assessing the true uncertainties.
We also take the opportunity to add semi-empirical f[ov] determinations for 13
additional binaries to our previous sample, and to update the values for 9
others. All are consistent with, and strengthen our previous conclusions,
supporting a dependence of f[ov] on mass that is now based on estimates for a

understanding of the early Universe, and contrasting its upcoming observations
with predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model requires detailed theoretical
forecasts. Here, we exploit the large dynamic range of the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite, TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300, to derive multi-band galaxy
luminosity functions from $z=2$ to $z=10$. We put particular emphasis on the
exploration of different dust attenuation models to determine galaxy luminosity
functions for the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), and apparent wide NIRCam bands.
Our most detailed dust model is based on continuum Monte Carlo radiative
transfer calculations employing observationally calibrated dust properties.
This calibration results in constraints on the redshift evolution of the dust
attenuation normalisation and dust-to-metal ratios yielding a stronger redshift
evolution of the attenuation normalisation compared to most previous
theoretical studies. Overall we find good agreement between the rest-frame UV
luminosity functions and observational data for all redshifts, also beyond the
regimes used for the dust-model calibrations. Furthermore, we also recover the
observed high redshift ($z=4-6$) UV luminosity versus stellar mass relation,
the H$\alpha$ versus star formation rate relation, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity
function at $z=2$. The bright end ($M_{\rm UV}>-19.5$) cumulative galaxy number
densities are consistent with observational data. For the F200W NIRCam band, we

  Predictions Inside the CO Snowline","  CO is thought to be the main reservoir of volatile carbon in protoplanetary
disks, and thus the primary initial source of carbon in the atmospheres of
forming giant planets. However, recent observations of protoplanetary disks
point towards low volatile carbon abundances in many systems, including at
radii interior to the CO snowline. One potential explanation is that gas phase
carbon is chemically reprocessed into less volatile species, which are frozen
on dust grain surfaces as ice. This mechanism has the potential to change the
primordial C/H ratio in the gas. However, current observations primarily probe
the upper layers of the disk. It is not clear if the low volatile carbon
abundances extend to the midplane, where planets form. We have run a grid of
198 chemical models, exploring how the chemical reprocessing of CO depends on
disk mass, dust grain size distribution, temperature, cosmic ray and X-ray
ionization rate, and initial water abundance. Building on our previous work
focusing on the warm molecular layer, here we analyze the results for our grid
of models in the disk midplane at 12 au. We find that either an ISM level
cosmic ray ionization rate or the presence of UV photons due to a low dust
surface density are needed to chemically reduce the midplane CO gas abundance
by at least an order of magnitude within 1 Myr. In the majority of our models
CO does not undergo substantial reprocessing by in situ chemistry and there is
little change in the gas phase C/H and C/O ratios over the lifetime of the
typical disk. However, in the small sub-set of disks where the disk midplane is
subject to a source of ionization or photolysis, the gas phase C/O ratio
increases by up to nearly 9 orders of magnitude due to conversion of CO into

  Unimorph Actuators","  We introduce Bee$^+$, a 95-mg four-winged microrobot with improved
controllability and open-loop-response characteristics with respect to those
exhibited by state-of-the-art two-winged microrobots with the same size and
similar weight (i.e., the 75-mg Harvard RoboBee). The key innovation that made
possible the development of Bee$^+$ is the introduction of an extremely light
(28-mg) pair of twinned unimorph actuators, which enabled the design of a new
microrobotic mechanism that flaps four wings independently. A first main
advantage of the proposed design, compared to those of two-winged flyers, is
that by increasing the number of actuators from two to four, the number of
direct control inputs increases from three to four when simple sinusoidal
excitations are employed. A second advantage of Bee$^+$ is that its four-wing
configuration and flapping mode naturally damp the rotational disturbances that
commonly affect the yaw degree of freedom of two-winged microrobots. In
addition, the proposed design greatly reduces the complexity of the associated
fabrication process compared to those of other microrobots, as the unimorph
actuators are fairly easy to build. Lastly, we hypothesize that given the
relatively low wing-loading affecting their flapping mechanisms, the life
expectancy of Bee$^+$s must be considerably higher than those of the two-winged
counterparts. The functionality and basic capabilities of the robot are
demonstrated through a set of simple control experiments.

Spitzer cryogenic mission Legacy program to map a region of the outer Milky Way
towards the Perseus and Outer spiral arms with the IRAC and MIPS instruments.
We identify 4648 YSOs across the field. Using the DBSCAN method we identify 68
clusters or aggregations of YSOs in the region, having 8 or more members. We
identify 1197 class Is, 2632 class IIs, 819 class IIIs, of which 45 are
candidate transition disk objects, utilizing the MIPS 24 photometry. The ratio
of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 2872/4648, or 62%. The ratios of
class I to class II YSOs in the clusters are broadly consistent with those
found in the inner galactic and nearby Gould's Belt young star formation
regions. The clustering properties indicate that the protostars may be more
tightly bound to their natal sites than the class IIs, and the class IIIs are
generally widely distributed. We further perform an analysis of the WISE data
of the SMOG field to determine how the lower resolution and sensitivity of WISE
affects the identification of YSOs as compared to Spitzer: we identify 931 YSOs
using combined WISE and 2MASS photometry, 931/4648 or 20% of the total number
identified with Spitzer. Performing the same clustering analysis finds 31
clusters which reliably trace the larger associations identified with the
Spitzer data. Twelve of the clusters identified have previously measured
distances from the WISE HII survey. SEDFitter modeling of these YSOs is
reported, leading to an estimation of the IMF in the aggregate of these
clusters which approximates that found in the inner galaxy, implying that the
processes behind stellar mass distribution during star formation are not widely
affected by the lower density and metallicity of the outer galaxy.

  Abundances in Dwarf Galaxies","  There is no consensus on the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
despite their importance for cosmology and chemical evolution. We address this
question by using our previously published catalogs of Mg, Si, Ca, Cr, Fe, Co,
and Ni abundances in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way to constrain the
mass at which the white dwarf explodes during a typical SN Ia. We fit a simple
bi-linear model to the evolution of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H], where X represents each
of the elements mentioned above. We use the evolution of [Mg/Fe] coupled with
theoretical supernova yields to isolate what fraction of the elements
originated in SNe Ia. Then, we infer the [X/Fe] yield of SNe Ia for all of the
elements except Mg. We compare these observationally inferred yields to recent
theoretical predictions for two classes of Chandrasekhar-mass (M_Ch) SN Ia as
well as sub-M_Ch SNe Ia. Most of the inferred SN Ia yields are consistent with
all of the theoretical models, but [Ni/Fe] is consistent only with sub-M_Ch
models. We conclude that the dominant type of SN Ia in ancient dwarf galaxies
is the explosion of a sub-M_Ch white dwarf. The Milky Way and dwarf galaxies
with extended star formation histories have higher [Ni/Fe] abundances, which
could indicate that the dominant class of SN Ia is different for galaxies where
star formation lasted for at least several Gyr.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10181v1,Making the Case for Visualization,"  Visual representation of information is a fundamental tool for advancing our
understanding of science. It enables the research community to extract new
knowledge from complex datasets, and plays an equally vital role in
communicating new results across a spectrum of public audiences. Visualizations
which make research results accessible to the public have been popularized by
the press, and are used in formal education, informal learning settings, and
all aspects of lifelong learning. In particular, visualizations of astronomical
data (hereafter astrovisualization or astroviz) have broadly captured the human
imagination, and are in high demand.
  Astrovisualization practitioners need a wide variety of specialized skills
and expertise spanning multiple disciplines (art, science, technology). As
astrophysics research continues to evolve into a more data rich science,
astroviz is also evolving from artists conceptions to data-driven
visualizations, from two-dimensional images to three-dimensional prints,
requiring new skills for development. Currently astroviz practitioners are
spread throughout the country. Due to the specialized nature of the field there
are seldom enough practitioners at one location to form an effective research
group for the exchange of knowledge on best practices and new techniques.
Because of the increasing importance of visualization in modern astrophysics,
the fact that the astroviz community is small and spread out in disparate
locations, and the rapidly evolving nature of this field, we argue for the
creation and nurturing of an Astroviz Community of Practice.
  We first summarize our recommendations. We then describe the current make-up
of astrovisualization practitioners, give an overview of the audiences they
serve, and highlight technological considerations.

within the Cyg OB2 star-forming region, and it is highly reddened
(E(B-V)=1.80+/-0.05) by interstellar extinction. In quiescence, the spectral
energy distribution is dominated by the 20,000 K photospheric emission from the
central B1II star, and at wavelenghts >=6 micron by emission from circumstellar
warm dust (Tdust up to 400 K). The 2018-19 eruption was caused by a marked
brightening of the accretion disk around the B1II star as traced by the

emission lines. At the peak of the eruption, the disk has a bulk temperature of
~7500 K and a luminosity L>=860 Lsun, corresponding to a mass accretion rate
>=1.1x10(-5) Msun/yr. Spectroscopic signature of possible bipolar jets (at -700

  trend of the total density profile","  We study the evolutionary trend of the total density profile of early-type
galaxies (ETGs) in IllustrisTNG. To this end, we trace ETGs from $z=0$ to $z=4$
and measure the power-law slope $\gamma^{\prime}$ of the total density profile
for their main progenitors. We find that their $\gamma^{\prime}$ steepen on
average during $z\sim4-2$, then becoming shallower until $z=1$, after which
they remain almost constant, aside from a residual trend of becoming shallower
towards $z=0$. We also compare to a statistical sample of ETGs at different
redshifts, selected based on their luminosity profiles and stellar masses. Due
to different selection effects, the average slopes of the statistical samples
follow a modified evolutionary trend. They monotonically decrease since $z=3$,
and after $z\approx 1$, they remain nearly invariant with a mild increase
towards $z=0$. These evolutionary trends are mass-dependent for both samples,
with low-mass galaxies having in general steeper slopes than their more massive
counterparts. Galaxies that transitioned to ETGs more recently have steeper
mean slopes as they tend to be smaller and more compact at any given redshift.
By analyzing the impact of mergers and AGN feedback on the progenitors'
evolution, we conjecture a multi-phase path leading to isothermality in ETGs:
dissipation associated with rapid wet mergers tends to steepen
$\gamma^{\prime}$ from $z=4$ to $z=2$, whereas subsequent AGN feedback
(especially in the kinetic mode) makes $\gamma^{\prime}$ shallower again from
$z=2$ to $z=1$. Afterwards, passive evolution from $z=1$ to $z=0$, mainly
through gas-poor mergers, mildly decreases $\gamma^{\prime}$ and maintains the
overall mass distribution close to isothermal.

radiation fields, dust physics and molecular chemistry (H$_2$) in the
interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. The model combines a state-of-the-art
radiation hydrodynamics module with a non-equilibrium thermochemistry module
that accounts for H$_2$ coupled to a realistic dust formation and destruction
model, all integrated into the new stellar feedback framework SMUGGLE. We test
this model on high-resolution isolated Milky-Way (MW) simulations. We show that
photoheating from young stars makes stellar feedback more efficient, but this
effect is quite modest in low gas surface density galaxies like the MW. The
multi-phase structure of the ISM, however, is highly dependent on the strength
of the interstellar radiation field. We are also able to predict the
distribution of H$_2$, that allow us to match the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt
(KS) relation, without calibrating for it. We show that the dust distribution
is a complex function of density, temperature and ionization state of the gas
which cannot be reproduced by simple scaling relations often used in the
literature. Our model is only able to match the observed dust temperature
distribution if radiation from the old stellar population is considered,
implying that these stars have a non-negligible contribution to dust heating in
the ISM. Our state-of-the-art model is well-suited for performing next

optical functionality is not determined by the properties of the base
materials, but rather by tailored, multiscale structures, in terms of precise
pore shape, geometry, and orientation. Embedding liquid crystals in pore space
provides additional opportunities to control light-matter interactions at the
single-pore, meta-atomic scale. Here, we present temperature-dependent 3D
reciprocal space mapping using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction in
combination with high-resolution birefringence experiments on disk-like
mesogens (HAT6) imbibed in self-ordered arrays of parallel cylindrical pores 17
to 160 nm across in monolithic anodic aluminium oxide (AAO). In agreement with
Monte Carlo computer simulations we observe a remarkably rich self-assembly
behaviour, unknown from the bulk state. It encompasses transitions between the
isotropic liquid state and discotic stacking in linear columns as well as
circular concentric ring formation perpendicular and parallel to the pore axis.
These textural transitions underpin an optical birefringence functionality,
tuneable in magnitude and in sign from positive to negative via pore size, pore
surface-grafting and temperature. Our study demonstrates that the advent of
large-scale, self-organised nanoporosity in monolithic solids along with
confinement-controllable phase behaviour of liquid-crystalline matter at the
single-pore scale provides a reliable and accessible tool to design materials
with adjustable optical anisotropy, and thus offers versatile pathways to
fine-tune polarisation-dependent light propagation speeds in materials. Such a
tailorability is at the core of the emerging field of transformative optics,

Recombination (RER), a potentially important recombination mechanism that has
hitherto been unexplored in low-temperature photoionized plasmas. RER shares
similarities with dielectronic recombination, with the difference that the
electron is captured into a highly excited state below the ionization threshold
-- rather than above the threshold -- of the recombining ion. We predict
transitions of carbon and oxygen ions that are formed via the RER process, and
their relative strengths with collisional-radiative spectral models. Optical C
II RER features are detected in published high-resolution spectra of eight
planetary nebulae, and a C III transition has been found in the ultraviolet
spectrum in a symbiotic star system. The relative intensities of these lines
are consistent with their production by this recombination mechanism. Because
RER has not previously been accounted for in photoionized plasmas, its
inclusion in models can significantly impact the predicted ionization balance
and hence abundance calculations of important astrophysical species.
Calculations for C+ suggest that the enhancement in the total recombination
rate can amount to a factor of 2.2 at 8100 K, increasing to 7.5 at T = 3500 K.
These results demonstrate the importance of including RER in models of

and 300 AU is possible. This is an example of an X-ray observation revealing
evidence of a low mass companion, which is important in completing the mass
ratio statistics of binary Cepheids. Furthermore, the detection of a young
X-ray bright companion is a further indication that the Cepheid (primary) is a
Population I star, even though its pulsation behavior differs from other
classical Cepheids.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11508v1,Characterizing hydrostatic mass bias with Mock-X,"  Surveys in the next decade will deliver large samples of galaxy clusters that
transform our understanding of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and
cosmology studies will become systematics limited with samples of this
magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters
provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this
is only realized if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way.
Here we introduce the \textsc{Mock-X} analysis framework, a multiwavelength
tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological simulations and derives
halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating
optical, Compton-$y$ and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image
analysis method, we demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring
hydrostatic mass bias for the IllustrisTNG, BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations.
Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant bias
$b\approx0.13$ with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or
subgrid physics. However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic
observations is mass-dependent, increasing to $b=0.3$ for the most massive
clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum
produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure
equilibrium. The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by
cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence.
The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical
method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current
observations and future surveys will contain sufficient samples of massive
clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic bias.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06857v1,CS Depletion in Prestellar Cores,"  The CS molecule is known to be absorbed onto dust in the cold and dense
conditions, causing it to get significantly depleted in the central region of
cores. This study is aimed to investigate the depletion of the CS molecule
using the optically thin C$^{34}$S molecular line observations. We mapped five
prestellar cores, L1544, L1552, L1689B, L694-2, and L1197 using two molecular
lines, C$^{34}$S $(J=2-1)$ and N$_2$H$^+$ $(J=1-0)$ with the NRO 45-m
telescope, doubling the number of cores where the CS depletion was probed using
C$^{34}$S. In most of our targets, the distribution of C$^{34}$S emission shows
features that suggest that the CS molecule is generally depleted in the center
of the prestellar cores. The radial profile of the CS abundance with respect to
H$_2$ directly measured from the CS emission and the Herschel dust emission
indicates that the CS molecule is depleted by a factor of $\sim$3 toward the
central regions of the cores with respect to their outer regions. The degree of
the depletion is found to be even more enhanced by an order of magnitude when
the contaminating effect introduced by the presence of CS molecules in the
surrounding envelope that lie along the line-of-sight is removed. Except for
L1197 which is classified as relatively the least evolved core in our targets
based on its observed physical parameters, we found that the remaining four
prestellar cores are suffering from significant CS depletion at their central
region regardless of the relative difference in their evolutionary status.

  Supernova Progenitors and New Evidence for a Mass-Spin Correlation","  Despite indications that superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) originate from
massive progenitors, the lack of a uniformly analyzed statistical sample has so
far prevented a detailed view of the progenitor mass distribution. Here we
present and analyze the pre-explosion mass distribution of hydrogen-poor SLSN
progenitors as determined from uniformly modelled light curves of 62 events. We
construct the distribution by summing the ejecta mass posteriors of each event,
using magnetar light curve models presented in our previous works (and using a
nominal neutron star remnant mass). The resulting distribution spans $3.6-40$
M$_{\odot}$, with a sharp decline at lower masses, and is best fit by a broken
power law described by ${\rm d}N/{\rm dlog}M \propto M^{-0.41 \pm 0.06}$ at
$3.6-8.6$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\propto M^{-1.26 \pm 0.06}$ at $8.6-40$ M$_{\odot}$.
We find that observational selection effects cannot account for the shape of
the distribution. Relative to Type Ib/c SNe, the SLSN mass distribution extends
to much larger masses and has a different power-law shape, likely indicating
that the formation of a magnetar allows more massive stars to explode as some
of the rotational energy accelerates the ejecta. Comparing the SLSN
distribution with predictions from single and binary star evolution models, we
find that binary models for a metallicity of $Z\lesssim 1/3$ Z$_{\odot}$ are
best able to reproduce its broad shape, in agreement with the preference of
SLSNe for low metallicity environments. Finally, we uncover a correlation
between the pre-explosion mass and the magnetar initial spin period, where
SLSNe with low masses have slower spins, a trend broadly consistent with the
effects of angular momentum transport evident in models of rapidly-rotating
carbon-oxygen stars.

  reconstructed with the E-MOSAICS simulations","  Globular clusters (GCs) formed when the Milky Way experienced a phase of
rapid assembly. We use the wealth of information contained in the Galactic GC
population to quantify the properties of the satellite galaxies from which the
Milky Way assembled. To achieve this, we train an artificial neural network on
the E-MOSAICS cosmological simulations of the co-formation and co-evolution of
GCs and their host galaxies. The network uses the ages, metallicities, and
orbital properties of GCs that formed in the same progenitor galaxies to
predict the stellar masses and accretion redshifts of these progenitors. We
apply the network to Galactic GCs associated with five progenitors: {\it
Gaia}-Enceladus, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and the recently
discovered, `low-energy' GCs, which provide an excellent match to the predicted
properties of the enigmatic galaxy `Kraken'. The five galaxies cover a narrow
stellar mass range [$M_\star=(0.6{-}4.6)\times10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$], but have
widely different accretion redshifts ($z_{\rm acc}=0.57{-}2.65$). All accretion
events represent minor mergers, but Kraken likely represents the most major
merger ever experienced by the Milky Way, with stellar and virial mass ratios
of $r_{M_\star}=1$:$31^{+34}_{-16}$ and $r_{M_{\rm h}}=1$:$7^{+4}_{-2}$,
respectively. The progenitors match the $z=0$ relation between GC number and
halo virial mass, but have elevated specific frequencies, suggesting an
evolution with redshift. Even though these progenitors likely were the Milky
Way's most massive accretion events, they contributed a total mass of only
$\log{(M_{\rm \star,tot}/{\rm M}_\odot)}=9.0\pm0.1$, similar to the stellar
halo. This implies that the Milky Way grew its stellar mass mostly by in-situ
star formation. We conclude by organising these accretion events into the most
detailed reconstruction to date of the Milky Way's merger tree.

  galaxies from current observations","  The very first galaxies that started the cosmic dawn likely resided in
so-called ""minihaloes"", with masses of $\sim10^5$-$10^8\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
accreting their gas from the intergalactic medium through H$_2$ cooling. Such
molecularly cooled galaxies (MCGs) mostly formed in pristine environments,
hosted massive, metal-free stars, and were eventually sterilized by the
build-up of a disassociating (Lyman-Werner; LW) background. Therefore, their
properties might be very different from the galaxies we see in the later
Universe. Although MCGs are probably too faint to be observed directly, we
could nevertheless infer their properties from the imprint they leave in the
cosmic 21-cm signal. Here we quantify this imprint by extending the public
simulation code 21cmFAST to allow for a distinct population of MCGs. We allow
MCGs to have different properties from other galaxies, including unique scaling
relations for their stellar-to-halo mass ratios, ionizing escape fractions, and
spectral energy distributions. We track inhomogeneous recombinations,
disassociative LW feedback, and photoheating from reionization. After
demonstrating how MCGs can shape the 21-cm signal, we explore to what extent
current observations can already place constraints on their properties. The
cosmic microwave background optical depth from Planck sets an upper limit on
the product of the ionizing escape fraction and the stellar mass in MCGs. When
including also the timing of the putative EDGES absorption signal, we find an
additional strong degeneracy between the stellar mass and the X-ray luminosity
of MCGs. If proven to be of cosmic origin, the timing of the EDGES signal would
have been set by MCGs.

use several different methods to model the TESS light curve of AI Phe combined
with spectroscopic orbits from multiple sources to estimate precisely the

agreement between different methods for the light curve analysis is very good

far out of equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems.
Understanding and utilizing these interactions is crucial to photo-control of
quantum many-body states. One of the most surprising examples of strong mode
coupling is the interaction between apical oxygen phonons and Josephson
plasmons in bilayer YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ superconductors. Experiments by Hu
et al (2014). and Kaiser et al. (2014) showed that below Tc, photo-excitation
of phonons leads to enhancement and frequency shifts of Josephson plasmon
edges, while aboveTc, photo-excited phonons induce plasmon edges even when
there are no discernible features in the equilibrium reflectivity spectrum.
Recent experiments by Van Hoegen et al. (2019) also observed parametric
generation of Josephson plasmons from photo-excited phonons both below Tc and
in the pseudogap phase. In this paper we present a theoretical model of
phonon-plasmon three wave interaction arising from coupling between the oxygen
motion and the in-plane superfluid stiffness. Analysis of the parametric
instability of plasmons based on this model gives frequencies of the most
unstable plasmons that are in agreement with experimental observations. We also
discuss how strong parametric excitation of Josephson plasmons can explain pump
induced changes in the TeraHertz reflectivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ in the
superconducting state, including frequency shifts and sharpening of Josephson
plasmon edges, as well as appearance of a new peak around 2THz. An interesting
feature of this model is that overdamped Josephson plasmons do not give any
discernible features in reflectivity in equilibrium, but can develop plasmon
edges when parametrically excited. We suggest that this mechanism explains
photo-induced plasmon edges in the pseudogap phase of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$.

Telescope's (HST) ACS/WFC camera. Our catalog contains 2,454 objects in the
magnitude range of $14.2<m_{\rm F775W}<24.7$, thus probing the stellar masses
of the ONC from $\sim$0.4 $M_\odot$ down to $\sim$0.02 $M_\odot$ over an area
of $\sim$550 arcmin$^2$. We provide a number of internal velocity dispersion
estimates for the ONC that indicate a weak dependence on the stellar location
and mass. There is good agreement with the published velocity dispersion
estimates, although nearly all of them (including ours at $\sigma_{v,x}=0.94$
and $\sigma_{v,y}=1.25$ mas yr$^{-1}$) might be biased by the overlapping young
stellar populations of Orion A. We identified 4 new ONC candidate runaways
based on HST and the Gaia DR2 data, all with masses less than $\sim$1
$M_\odot$. The total census of known candidate runaway sources is 10 -- one of
the largest samples ever found in any Milky Way open star cluster.
Surprisingly, none of them has the tangential velocity exceeding 20 km
s$^{-1}$. If most of them indeed originated in the ONC, it may compel
re-examination of dynamical processes in very young star clusters. It appears
that the mass function of the ONC is not significantly affected by the lost
runaways.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07383v3,"Quantifying the Line-of-Sight Halo Contribution to the Dark Matter
  Convergence Power Spectrum from Strong Gravitational Lenses","  Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses have become a popular probe of dark
matter (DM) by providing a window into structure formation on the smallest
scales. In particular, the convergence power spectrum of subhalos within
lensing galaxies has been suggested as a promising observable to study DM.
However, the distances involved in strong-lensing systems are vast, and we
expect the relevant volume to contain line-of-sight (LOS) halos that are not
associated with the main lens. We develop a formalism to calculate the effect
of LOS halos as an effective convergence power spectrum. The multi-lens plane
equation couples the angular deflections of consecutive lens planes, but by
assuming that the perturbations due to the LOS halos are small, we show that
they can be projected onto the main-lens plane as effective subhalos. We test
our formalism by simulating lensing systems using the full multi-plane lens
equation and find excellent agreement. We show how the relative contribution of
LOS halos and subhalos depends on the source and lens redshift, as well as the
assumed halo and subhalo mass functions. For a fiducial system with fraction of
DM halo mass in substructure $f_{\rm sub}=0.4\%$ for subhalo masses
$[10^5-10^8]\rm{M}_{\odot}$, the interloper contribution to the power spectrum
is at least several times greater than that of subhalos for source redshifts
$z_s\gtrsim0.5$. Furthermore, it is likely that for the SLACS and BELLS lenses
the interloper contribution dominates: $f_{\rm sub}\gtrsim2\%$ ($4\%$) is
needed for subhalos to dominate in SLACS (BELLS), which is higher than current
upper bounds on $f_{\rm sub}$ for our mass range. Since the halo mass function
is better understood from first principles, the dominance of interlopers in
galaxy-galaxy lenses with high-quality imaging can be seen as a significant
advantage when translating this observable into a constraint on DM.

  R2-IRS2 seen with ALMA","  Theories of massive star formation predict that massive protostars accrete
gas through circumstellar disks. Although several cases have been found already
thanks to high-angular resolution interferometry, it remains unknown the
internal physical structure of these disks and, in particular, whether they
present warps or internal holes as observed in low-mass proto-planetary disks.
Here, we report very high angular resolution observations of the H21alpha radio
recombination line carried out in Band 9 with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (beam of 80 mas x 60 mas, or 70 au x 50 au)
toward the IRS2 massive young stellar object in the Monoceros R2 star-forming
cluster. The H21alpha line shows maser amplification, which allows us to study
the kinematics and physical structure of the ionised gas around the massive
protostar down to spatial scales of ~1-2 au. Our ALMA images and 3D radiative
transfer modelling reveal that the ionized gas around IRS2 is distributed in a
Keplerian circumstellar disk and an expanding wind. The H21alpha emission
centroids at velocities between -10 and 20 km s-1 deviate from the disk plane,
suggesting a warping for the disk. This could be explained by the presence of a
secondary object (a stellar companion or a massive planet) within the system.
The ionized wind seems to be launched from the disk surface at distances ~11 au
from the central star, consistent with magnetically-regulated disk wind models.
This suggests a similar wind launching mechanism to that recently found for
evolved massive stars such as MWC349A and MWC922.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16970v1,TXS 0128+554: A Young Gamma-Ray Emitting AGN With Episodic Jet Activity,"  We have carried out a Chandra X-ray and multi-frequency radio VLBA study of
the AGN TXS 0128+554, which is associated with the Fermi gamma-ray source 4FGL
J0131.2+5547. The AGN is unresolved in a target 19.3 ks Chandra image, and its
spectrum is well fit by a simple absorbed power law model, with no
distinguishable spectral features. Its relatively soft X-ray spectrum compared
to other CSOs may be indicative of a thermal emission component, for which we
were able to obtain an upper temperature limit of kT = 0.08 keV. The compact
radio morphology and measured advance speed of 0.32c +- 0.07c indicate a
kinematic age of only 82 y +- 17 y, placing TXS 0128+554 among the youngest
members of the compact symmetric object (CSO) class. The lack of compact,
inverted spectrum hotspots and an emission gap between the bright inner jet and
outer radio lobe structure indicate that the jets have undergone episodic
activity, and were re-launched a decade ago. The predicted gamma-ray emission
from the lobes, based on an inverse Compton-emitting cocoon model, is three
orders of magnitude below the observed Fermi LAT flux. A comparison to other
Fermi-detected and non-Fermi detected CSOs with redshift z<0.1 indicates that
the gamma-ray emission likely originates in the inner jet/core region, and that
nearby, recently launched AGN jets are primary candidates for detection by the
Fermi LAT instrument.

  Quiescent Galaxy at z $\sim$ 2","  Measuring the chemical composition of galaxies is crucial to our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution models. However, such
measurements are extremely challenging for quiescent galaxies at high
redshifts, which have faint stellar continua and compact sizes, making it
difficult to detect absorption lines and nearly impossible to spatially resolve
them. Gravitational lensing offers the opportunity to study these galaxies with
detailed spectroscopy that can be spatially resolved. In this work, we analyze
deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the
brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1. Taking advantage of
full spectral fitting, we measure $[{\rm Mg/Fe}]=0.51\pm0.05$,
$[\rm{Fe/H}]=0.26\pm0.04$, and, for the first time, the stellar abundances of 6
other elements in this galaxy. We further constrained, also for the first time
in a $z\sim2$ galaxy, radial gradients in stellar age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe]. We
detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in
[Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies.
Our measurements show that not only is MRG-M0138 very Mg-enhanced compared to
the centers of local massive early-type galaxies, it is also very iron rich.
These dissimilar abundances suggest that even the inner regions of massive
galaxies have experienced significant mixing of stars in mergers, in contrast
to a purely inside-out growth model. The abundance pattern observed in
MRG-M0138 challenges simple galactic chemical evolution models that vary only
the star formation timescale and shows the need for more elaborate models.

  Interactions in Global GRHD Simulations","  When a star passes close to a supermassive black hole (BH), the BH's tidal
forces rip it apart into a thin stream, leading to a tidal disruption event
(TDE). In this work, we study the post-disruption phase of TDEs in general
relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) using our GPU-accelerated code H-AMR. We
carry out the first grid-based simulation of a deep-penetration TDE ($\beta=7$)
with realistic system parameters: a black-hole-to-star mass ratio of $10^6$, a
parabolic stellar trajectory, and a nonzero BH spin. We also carry out the
first such simulation for a tilted TDE whose stellar orbit is inclined relative
to the BH midplane. We show that for our aligned TDE, an accretion disk forms
due to the dissipation of orbital energy, which is initially dominated by
violent self-intersections, and later by stream-disk interactions near the
pericenter, with $\sim20\%$ of the infalling material reaching the BH. The
self-intersections completely disrupt the stream, resulting in five distinct
self-intersection events separated by approximately 12 hours and a flaring in
the accretion rate. For our tilted TDE, we find only partial self-intersections
due to polar precession. Although they eject gas out of the orbital plane, an
accretion disk still forms with a similar accreted fraction of the material to
the aligned case. These results have important implications for disk formation
in realistic tidal disruptions. For instance, the periodicity in accretion rate
induced by the complete stream disruption may explain the flaring events from
Swift J1644+57.

visual dimming during 2019 December and the first quarter of 2020 reaching an
historic minimum 2020 February 7$-$13. During 2019 September-November, prior to
the optical dimming event, the photosphere was expanding. At the same time,
spatially resolved ultraviolet spectra using the Hubble Space Telescope/Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph revealed a substantial increase in the
ultraviolet spectrum and Mg II line emission from the chromosphere over the
southern hemisphere of the star. Moreover, the temperature and electron density
inferred from the spectrum and C II diagnostics also increased in this
hemisphere. These changes happened prior to the Great Dimming Event. Variations
in the Mg II k-line profiles suggest material moved outwards in response to the
passage of a pulse or acoustic shock from 2019 September through 2019 November.
It appears that this extraordinary outflow of material from the star, likely
initiated by convective photospheric elements, was enhanced by the coincidence
with the outward motions in this phase of the $\sim$400 day pulsation cycle.
These ultraviolet observations appear to provide the connecting link between
the known large convective cells in the photosphere and the mass ejection event

December, and led to the exceptional optical dimming of Betelgeuse in 2020

targeted. One is the mapping of the distribution of neutral atomic carbon, and
the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule in higher energy states, in large parts of
the Milky Way, and in selected external galaxies. Such studies would advance
our understanding of molecular hydrogen present in the interstellar medium, but
partly missed by existing observations; and characterize Galaxy-wide molecular
cloud excitation conditions, through multi-level CO observations. Stars form in
interstellar clouds of molecular gas and dust, and these observations would
allow research into the formation and destruction processes of such molecular
clouds and the life cycle of galaxies. As the second goal, the observatory
would add a new location to the global Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) network,

the quality of the images synthesized by the EHT, support observations in
higher sub-millimeter wave bands, sharpening its resolving ability, improve its

responsible for complex lighting effects including diffuse, specular,

and self-shadowing are not modeled. We present a new neural representation for
face reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance
responsible for the final appearance from a single monocular image. Instead of
modeling each component of the reflectance separately using parametric models,
our neural representation allows us to generate a basis set of faces in a
geometric deformation-invariant space, parameterized by the input light
direction, viewpoint and face geometry. We learn to reconstruct this
reflectance field of a face just from a monocular image, which can be used to
render the face from any viewpoint in any light condition. Our method is
trained on a light-stage training dataset, which captures 300 people
illuminated with 150 light conditions from 8 viewpoints. We show that our
method outperforms existing monocular reflectance reconstruction methods, in
terms of photorealism due to better capturing of physical premitives, such as
sub-surface scattering, specularities, self-shadows and other higher-order
effects.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09220v1,"DM halo morphological types of MW-like galaxies in the TNG50 simulation:
  Simple, Twisted, or Stretched","  We present a comprehensive study of the shape analysis of dark matter (DM)
halos in a sample of 25 Milky Way (MW) like galaxies in the TNG50 run of the
IllustrisTNG project. Using an Enclosed Volume Iterative Method, we infer an
oblate-triaxial shape for DM halos with a median $T\simeq 0.24$. we group DM
halos in 3 different classes. Simple halos(36%) establish three principal axes
whose ordering in magnitude does not change with radius and whose orientations
are almost fixed throughout the entirety of the halo. Twisted halos(36%) show
some levels of gradual rotations between 50 to 100 degs radially. Finally,
stretched halos(28%) demonstrate a stretching in their axes lengths where the
ordering of different eigenvalues change radially. And, the halo experiences a
`rotation' of $\sim$90 deg at that radius. Visualizing the 3D ellipsoid of DM
halos, for the first time, we report signs of a re-orienting ellipsoid in both
twisted and stretched classes. We examine the impact of baryonic physics on the
DM halo shape through a comparison to dark matter only (DMO) simulations. We
report a triaxial-prolate DM halo with a median $T\simeq 0.64$. Therefore
baryonic effects make DM halos less elongated. We analyze the impact of
substructure on the DM halo shape and confirm that it is subdominant. We study
the distribution of satellites with masses above $10^7 M_{\odot}$ and at the
distance of less than 200 kpc. Satellites in simple halos are in general closer
to the center and are more aligned with the central galaxy's angular momentum.
Satellites in twisted halo class, present a bi-modal behavior in the
distribution of their angles. Finally, satellites of stretched halos are
farther out from the center and are more misaligned. We connect the above
theoretical results to observations from the literature. Overlaying our
theoretical outcome with the observational results establishes a fair
agreement.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13623v1,"TOI 540 b: A Planet Smaller than Earth Orbiting a Nearby Rapidly
  Rotating Low-mass Star","  We present the discovery of TOI 540 b, a hot planet slightly smaller than
Earth orbiting the low-mass star 2MASS J05051443-4756154. The planet has an
orbital period of $P = 1.239149$ days ($\pm$ 170 ms) and a radius of $r = 0.903
\pm 0.052 R_{\rm Earth}$, and is likely terrestrial based on the observed
mass-radius distribution of small exoplanets at similar insolations. The star
is 14.008 pc away and we estimate its mass and radius to be $M = 0.159 \pm
0.014 M_{\rm Sun}$ and $R = 0.1895 \pm 0.0079 R_{\rm Sun}$, respectively. The
star is distinctive in its very short rotational period of $P_{\rm rot} =
17.4264 +/- 0.0094$ hours and correspondingly small Rossby number of 0.007 as
well as its high X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratio of $L_X / L_{\rm bol} =
0.0028$ based on a serendipitous XMM-Newton detection during a slew operation.
This is consistent with the X-ray emission being observed at a maximum value of
$L_X / L_{\rm bol} \simeq 10^{-3}$ as predicted for the most rapidly rotating M
dwarfs. TOI 540 b may be an alluring target to study atmospheric erosion due to
the strong stellar X-ray emission. It is also among the most accessible targets
for transmission and emission spectroscopy and eclipse photometry with JWST,
and may permit Doppler tomography with high-resolution spectroscopy during
transit. This discovery is based on precise photometric data from TESS and
ground-based follow-up observations by the MEarth team.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.09217v2,"BICEP2 / Keck Array VI: Improved Constraints On Cosmology and
  Foregrounds When Adding 95 GHz Data From Keck Array","  We present results from an analysis of all data taken by the BICEP2 & Keck
Array CMB polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing
season. This includes the first Keck Array observations at 95 GHz. The maps
reach a depth of 50 nK deg in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ in the 150 GHz band and 127 nK
deg in the 95 GHz band. We take auto- and cross-spectra between these maps and
publicly available maps from WMAP and Planck at frequencies from 23 GHz to 353
GHz. An excess over lensed-LCDM is detected at modest significance in the
95x150 $BB$ spectrum, and is consistent with the dust contribution expected
from our previous work. No significant evidence for synchrotron emission is
found in spectra such as 23x95, or for correlation between the dust and
synchrotron sky patterns in spectra such as 23x353. We take the likelihood of
all the spectra for a multi-component model including lensed-LCDM, dust,
synchrotron and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves
(as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using priors on the
frequency spectral behaviors of dust and synchrotron emission from previous
analyses of WMAP and Planck data in other regions of the sky. This analysis
yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}<0.09$ at 95% confidence, which is robust to
variations explored in analysis and priors. Combining these $B$-mode results
with the (more model-dependent) constraints from Planck analysis of CMB
temperature plus BAO and other data, yields a combined limit $r_{0.05}<0.07$ at
95% confidence. These are the strongest constraints to date on inflationary
gravitational waves.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03234v1,SDSS-V: Pioneering Panoptic Spectroscopy,"  SDSS-V will be an all-sky, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of over six
million objects. It is designed to decode the history of the Milky Way, trace
the emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner workings of stars, and
investigate the origin of planets. It will also create an integral-field
spectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local Group that is 1,000x
larger than the current state of the art and at high enough spatial resolution
to reveal the self-regulation mechanisms of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will
pioneer systematic, spectroscopic monitoring across the whole sky, revealing
changes on timescales from 20 minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track
the flickers, flares, and radical transformations of the most luminous
persistent objects in the universe: massive black holes growing at the centers
of galaxies.
  The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V will be unique among extant and future
spectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey infrastructures in
both hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical multi-object fiber
spectroscopy that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve high target densities,
targets of opportunity, and time-domain monitoring; and it provides optical,
ultra-wide-field integral field spectroscopy. SDSS-V, with its programs
anticipated to start in 2020, will be well-timed to multiply the scientific
output from major space missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based
projects. SDSS-V builds on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data
analysis, collaboration infrastructure, and product deliverables. The project
is now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies, and
developing new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We present

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05216v1,"BICEP2 / Keck Array x: Constraints on Primordial Gravitational Waves
  using Planck, WMAP, and New BICEP2/Keck Observations through the 2015 Season","  We present results from an analysis of all data taken by the BICEP2/Keck CMB
polarization experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season. This
includes the first Keck Array observations at 220 GHz and additional
observations at 95 & 150 GHz. The $Q/U$ maps reach depths of 5.2, 2.9 and 26
$\mu$K$_{cmb}$ arcmin at 95, 150 and 220 GHz respectively over an effective
area of $\approx 400$ square degrees. The 220 GHz maps achieve a
signal-to-noise on polarized dust emission approximately equal to that of
Planck at 353 GHz. We take auto- and cross-spectra between these maps and
publicly available WMAP and Planck maps at frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz. We
evaluate the joint likelihood of the spectra versus a multicomponent model of
lensed-$\Lambda$CDM+$r$+dust+synchrotron+noise. The foreground model has seven
parameters, and we impose priors on some of these using external information
from Planck and WMAP derived from larger regions of sky. The model is shown to
be an adequate description of the data at the current noise levels. The
likelihood analysis yields the constraint $r_{0.05}<0.07$ at 95% confidence,
which tightens to $r_{0.05}<0.06$ in conjunction with Planck temperature
measurements and other data. The lensing signal is detected at $8.8 \sigma$
significance. Running maximum likelihood search on simulations we obtain
unbiased results and find that $\sigma(r)=0.020$. These are the strongest
constraints to date on primordial gravitational waves.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05293v1,"Envisioning the next decade of Galactic Center science: a laboratory for
  the study of the physics and astrophysics of supermassive black holes","  As the closest example of a galactic nucleus, the Galactic center (GC)
presents an exquisite laboratory for learning about supermassive black holes
(SMBH) and their environment. We describe several exciting new research
directions that, over the next 10 years, hold the potential to answer some of
the biggest scientific questions raised in recent decades: Is General
Relativity (GR) the correct description for supermassive black holes? What is
the nature of star formation in extreme environments? How do stars and compact
objects dynamically interact with the supermassive black hole? What physical
processes drive gas accretion in low-luminosity black holes? We describe how
the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and astrometric precision offered by
the next generation of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics will
help us answer these questions. First, it will be possible to obtain precision
measurements of stellar orbits in the Galaxy's central potential, providing
both tests of GR in the unexplored regime near a SMBH and measurements of the
extended dark matter distribution that is predicted to exist at the GC. Second,
we will probe stellar populations at the GC to significantly lower masses than
are possible today, down to brown dwarfs. Their structure and dynamics will
provide an unprecedented view of the stellar cusp around the SMBH and will
distinguish between models of star formation in this extreme environment. This
increase in depth will also allow us to measure the currently unknown
population of compact remnants at the GC by observing their effects on luminous
sources. Third, uncertainties on the mass of and distance to the SMBH can be
improved by a factor of $\sim$10. Finally, we can also study the near-infrared
accretion onto the black hole at unprecedented sensitivity and time resolution,
which can reveal the underlying physics of black hole accretion.

  Temperature-to-Polarization Leakage in the BK15 Dataset","  Precision measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
require extreme control of instrumental systematics. In a companion paper we
have presented cosmological constraints from observations with the BICEP2 and
Keck Array experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season (BK15),
resulting in the deepest CMB polarization maps to date and a statistical
sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\sigma(r) = 0.020$. In this work
we characterize the beams and constrain potential systematic contamination from
main beam shape mismatch at the three BK15 frequencies (95, 150, and 220 GHz).
Far-field maps of 7,360 distinct beam patterns taken from 2010-2015 are used to
measure differential beam parameters and predict the contribution of
temperature-to-polarization leakage to the BK15 B-mode maps. In the
multifrequency, multicomponent likelihood analysis that uses BK15, Planck, and
WMAP maps to separate sky components, we find that adding this predicted
leakage to simulations induces a bias of $\Delta r = 0.0027 \pm 0.0019$. Future
results using higher-quality beam maps and improved techniques to detect such
leakage in CMB data will substantially reduce this uncertainty, enabling the
levels of systematics control needed for BICEP Array and other experiments that

http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01981v3,"The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Science case and
  survey design","  The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic, all-sky radio sky
survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution ($\approx$2.5""),
sensitivity (a 1$\sigma$ goal of 70 $\mu$Jy/beam in the coadded data), full
linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz).
The first observations began in September 2017, and observing for the survey
will finish in 2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hours of time on the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA
(Declination $>-40^{\circ}$), a total of 33,885 deg$^2$. The data will be taken
in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources.
The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength
astronomers, and citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an ""on the fly""
interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much reduced compared to a
conventional pointed survey. In this paper, we present the science case and
observational strategy for the survey, and also results from early survey
observations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610926v1,"The Astrobiology Primer: An Outline of General Knowledge - Version 1,
  2006","  Astrobiology, the study of life as a planetary phenomenon, aims to understand
the fundamental nature of life on earth and the possibility of life elsewhere.
To achieve this goal, astrobiologists have initiated unprecedented
communication between the disciplines of astronomy, biology, chemistry, and
geology. The Astrobiology Primer has been created as a reference tool for those
who are interested in the interdisciplinary field of astrobiology. The field
incorporates many diverse research endeavors, but it is our hope that this slim
volume will present the reader with all he or she needs to know to become
involved and to understand, at least at a fundamental level, the state of the
art. Because of the great diversity of material, each section was written by a
different author with a different expertise. The Primer was constructed
collaboratively. Ninety researchers from around the world contributed
information with regard to what they expected from other astrobiologists and
what they would like to know themselves but still had difficulty understanding
(see Contributors). Those submissions were read and considered by the Editors
who produced a list of seven general categories of knowledge, represented by
the seven chapters in the Primer: 1) Stellar Formation and Evolution, 2)
Planetary Formation and Evolution, 3) Astrobiogeochemistry and the Origin of
Life, 4) Evolution of Life through Time, 5) Planet Detection &
Characterization, 6) Diversity of Life, and 7) Science in Space. No one volume,
of course, can contain the vast amount of information brought to play in
astrobiology, but we believe that the Primer will provide a forum and a
language around which the community will have the opportunity to develop a
consensus about central issues.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4473v2,"Stellar SEDs from 0.3-2.5 Microns: Tracing the Stellar Locus and
  Searching for Color Outliers in SDSS and 2MASS","  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are
rich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure and
formation history of the Galaxy. As new surveys and instruments adopt similar
filter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of the
ugrizJHKs stellar locus, both to inform studies of `normal' main sequence stars
as well as for robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. Using a
sample of ~600,000 point sources detected by SDSS and 2MASS, we tabulate the
position and width of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus as a function of g-i color,
and provide accurate polynomial fits. We map the Morgan-Keenan spectral type
sequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectral
standards and by analyzing 3000 SDSS stellar spectra with a custom spectral
typing pipeline. We develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimum
separation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and use
it to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurious
SDSS/2MASS matches. Analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliers
identifies 370 white-dwarf/M dwarf (WDMD) pairs, 93 QSOs, and 90 M giant/carbon
star candidates, and demonstrates that WDMD pairs and QSOs can be distinguished
on the basis of their J-Ks and r-z colors. We also identify a group of objects
with correlated offsets in the u-g vs. g-r and g-r vs. r-i color-color spaces,
but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects.
Future applications of this algorithm to a matched SDSS-UKIDSS catalog may well
identify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areas

http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2975v1,X-ray properties of protostars in the Orion Nebula,"  The origin and evolution of the X-rays in very young stellar objects (YSOs)
are not yet well understood since it is very hard to observe YSOs in the
protostellar phase. We study the X-ray properties of Class 0-I objects in the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and compare them with those of the more evolved
Class II and III members. Using Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) data, we
study the X-ray properties of stars in different evolutionary classes:
luminosities, NH, temperatures and time variability are compared in order to
understand if the interaction between the circumstellar material and the
central object can influence the X-ray emission. We have assembled the deepest
and most complete photometric catalog of objects in the ONC region from the UV
to 8 microns using data from HST, WFI@2.2m ESO and ISPI@4m CTIO telescopes, and
Spitzer IRAC. We select high probability candidate Class 0-I protostars,
distinguishing between those having a spectral energy distribution which rises
from K up to 8 microns (Class 0-Ia) from those where the SED rises from K up to
4.5 microns and decreasing afterwards (Class 0-Ib). We select a sample of bona
fide Class II stars and a set of Class III stars with IR emission consistent
with normal photospheres. Our principal result is that Class 0-Ia objects are
significantly less luminous in X-rays, both in the total and hard bands, than
the more evolved Class II stars with mass larger than 0.5 Msun; these latter
show X-ray luminosities similar to those of Class 0-Ib stars. This result
supports the hypothesis that the onset of X-ray emission occurs at a very early
stage of star formation. Temporal variability and spectral properties of Class
0-I stars are similar to those of the more evolved Class II and III objects,
except for a larger absorption likely due to gas in the circumstellar material.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3215v3,"Observations of the Naked-Eye GRB 080319B: Implications of Nature's
  Brightest Explosion","  The first gamma-ray burst (GRB) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen with
the naked eye, GRB 080319B at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisite
follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. We present our
detailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over
5000 images starting 51 s after the GRB trigger, in concert with our own
analysis of the Swift data. The event is extreme not only in observed
properties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded at
optical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly high
isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. At early times, the
afterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,
but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. The overall spectral
energy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infrared
wavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction in
the host frame. The afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: starting
at about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red at
late times. In our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidence
for an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. Finally, we examine the
detectability of such events with current and future facilities and find that
such an event could be detected in gamma-rays by BAT out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),
while the nominal EXIST sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. At K band,
this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~
17.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4717v1,How do Galaxies Accrete Gas and Form Stars?,"  Great strides have been made in the last two decades in determining how
galaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structures
we observe at z=0. The role of mergers has been documented through both
observations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent these
initial dark matter seeds have been discovered in the Local Group, high
redshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, and
the gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments.
Despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons are
still unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. One of the major problems is our
incomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequently
forms stars. Galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accurately
represent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observations
have only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range of
redshifts and environments. How galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form stars
is a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalactic
astrophysics. In this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area in
the next decade.

Variable R71, supernova remnant N49, a large number of young stellar objects,
compact HII regions and molecular cores, and a background galaxy (z~0.175). We
use the spectra to constrain the presence and temperature of cold dust and the
excitation conditions and shocks within the neutral and ionized gas, in the
circumstellar environments and interfaces with the surrounding ISM. Evolved
stars, including LBV R71, lack cold dust except in some cases where we argue
that this is swept-up ISM. This leads to an estimate of the duration of the
prolific dust-producing phase (""superwind"") of several thousand years for both
RSGs and massive AGB stars, with a similar fractional mass loss experienced
despite the different masses. We tentatively detect line emission from neutral
oxygen in the extreme RSG WOHG064, with implications for the wind driving. In
N49, the shock between the supernova ejecta and ISM is revealed by its strong
[OI] 63-micron emission and possibly water vapour; we estimate that 0.2 Msun of
ISM dust was swept up. Some of the compact HII regions display pronounced
[OIII] 88-micron emission. The efficiency of photo-electric heating in the
interfaces of ionized gas and molecular clouds is estimated at 0.1-0.3%. We
confirm earlier indications of a low nitrogen content in the LMC. Evidence for
solid state emission features is found in both young and evolved object; some
of the YSOs are found to contain crystalline water ice.

curves for the Halpha, Hgamma, HeII 4686, and HeI 5876 emission lines and the
time lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuum

the masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. The time-lag
response as a function of velocity across the Balmer line profiles is examined

http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4318v2,LBT/LUCIFER Observations of the z~2 Lensed Galaxy J0900+2234,"  We present rest-frame optical images and spectra of the gravitationally
lensed, star-forming galaxy J0900+2234 (z=2.03). The observations were
performed with the newly commissioned LUCIFER1 near-infrared instrument mounted
on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We fit lens models to the rest-frame
optical images and find the galaxy has an intrinsic effective radius of 7.4 kpc
with a lens magnification factor of about 5 for the A and B components. We also
discovered a new arc belonging to another lensed high-z source galaxy, which
makes this lens system a potential double Einstein ring system. Using the high
S/N rest-frame optical spectra covering H+K band, we detected Hbeta, OIII,
Halpha, NII and SII emission lines. Detailed physical properties of this high-z
galaxy were derived. The extinction towards the ionized HII regions (E_g(B-V))
is computed from the flux ratio of Halpha and Hbeta and appears to be much
higher than that towards stellar continuum (E_s(B-V)), derived from the optical
and NIR broad band photometry fitting. The metallicity was estimated using N2
and O3N2 indices. It is in the range of 1/5-1/3 solar abundance, which is much
lower than the typical z~2 star-forming galaxies. From the flux ratio of SII
6717 and 6732, we found that the electron number density of the HII regions in
the high-z galaxy were >1000 cm^-3, consistent with other z~2 galaxies but much
higher than that in local HII regions. The star-formation rate was estimated
via the Halpha luminosity, after correction for the lens magnification, to be
about 365\pm69 Msun/yr. Combining the FWHM of Halpha emission lines and the
half-light radius, we found the dynamical mass of the lensed galaxy is
5.8\pm0.9x10^10 Msun. The gas mass is 5.1\pm1.1x10^10~Msun from the H\alpha

http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4613v2,"Nearby Supernova Rates from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search. III.
  The Rate-Size Relation, and the Rates as a Function of Galaxy Hubble Type and
  Colour","  This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements of
the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from
the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have considered a sample of
about 1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe
Ibc, and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as
a function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as
luminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass, and morphological class. We
discuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions,
inclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their
uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements
shows that they are consistent with each other to within uncertainties when the
rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data
demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter
using either galaxy Hubble types or B - K colours. A secondary parameter in
galaxy ""size"", expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately
describe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes
have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN
rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We
examine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation
for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the
specific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether
the same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component
(""tardy"" and ""prompt"") model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in
young stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the
core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric and Milky Way rates ... (abridged)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2674v2,Ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type Ic supernovae,"  Recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group of
extremely luminous optical transients. The initial discoveries of SN 2005ap by
the Texas Supernova Search and SCP-06F6 in a deep Hubble pencil beam survey
were followed by the Palomar Transient Factory confirmation of host redshifts
for other similar transients. The transients share the common properties of
high optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and a
lack of H or He spectral features. The physical mechanism that produces the
luminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion to
pulsational pair-instability. Here we report the most detailed photometric and
spectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (SN 2010gx) detected in the
Pan-STARRS 1 sky survey. In common with other transients in this family,
early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption lines
of O II. However, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type Ic
supernova features, showing the characteristic broad Fe II and Si II absorption
lines. Detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all SN 2005ap and
SCP-06F6 type transients are linked to supernovae Ic. This poses problems in
understanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication from
late-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56Ni, the broad
lightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolution
is quite different from typical Ic timescales. The nature of the progenitor
stars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3183v1,"The Properties of the Interstellar Medium within a Star-Forming Galaxy
  at z=2.3","  We present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas emission in the
rest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3
sub-millimetre galaxy SMM J2135-0102. We obtain very high signal-to-noise
detections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20
transitions from 9 species. We use the 12CO, [CI] and HCN line strengths to
investigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ISM)
chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,
dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitation
massive component. Employing photo-dissociation region models we show that on
average the molecular gas is exposed to a UV radiation field that is ~1000 x
more intense than the Milky Way, with star-forming regions having a
characteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. These conditions are similar to those
found in local ULIRGs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,
even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. The 12CO
spectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence that
the system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,
including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray flux
within clouds. We show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas and
star-formation surface densities appear to follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our data
suggest that this relation breaks down on scales of <100pc. By virtue of the
lens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on the
star formation and ISM at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recently
become possible at z<0.1, and show the potential physical properties that will
be studied in unlensed galaxies when ALMA is in full operation. (Abridged).

keV (rest frame) space density of X-ray selected AGNs detected in the Chandra
COSMOS survey. The sample comprises 81 X-ray detected sources with available
spectroscopic (31) and photometric (50) redshifts plus 20 sources with a formal
z_phot<3 but with a broad photometric redshift probability distribution, such
that z_phot+1sigma>3. 81 sources are selected in the 0.5-2 keV band, 14 are
selected in the 2-10 keV and 6 in the 0.5-10 keV bands. We sample the high
luminosity (log L_(2-10 keV)>44.15 erg/s) space density up to z~5 and a fainter
luminosity range (43.5<log L(2-10 keV)<44.15 erg/s) than previous studies, up
to z=3.5. We weighted the contribution to the number counts and the space
density of the sources with photometric redshift by using their probability of
being at z>3. We find that the space density of high-luminosity AGNs declines
exponentially at all the redshifts, confirming the trend observed for optically
selected quasars. At lower luminosity, the measured space density is not
conclusive, and a larger sample of faint sources is needed. Comparisons with
optical luminosity functions and BH formation models are presented together
with prospects for future surveys.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6058v3,"The stellar masses and specific star-formation rates of submillimetre
  galaxies","  Establishing the stellar masses (M*), and hence specific star-formation rates
(sSFRs) of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) is crucial for determining their role
in the cosmic galaxy/star formation. However, there is as yet no consensus over
the typical M* of SMGs. Specifically, even for the same set of SMGs, the
reported average M* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from ~5x10^10 Mo to
~5x10^11 Mo. Here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to such
widely varying results. We find that, contrary to recent claims in the
literature, potential contamination of IRAC 3-8 um photometry from hot dust
associated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the published
discrepancies in derived M*. Instead, we expose in detail how inferred M*
depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify the
individual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial mass
function, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and different
forms of assumed star-formation history. We review current observational
evidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from the
hydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choices
of these model inputs, the average M* of SMGs is ~2x10^11 Mo. We also confirm
that this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latest
measurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving M* function of the
overall galaxy population. M* of this order imply that the average sSFR of SMGs
is comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z>2, at 2-3 Gyr^-1.
This supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any M*, most
SMGs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at
these redshifts. Conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint that
SMGs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmic
history of star-formation.

QSO IRAS 13349+2438. Optical spectra reveal extreme Eigenvector-1
characteristics, but the H-beta line width argues against a NLS1
classification; we refine z=0.10853 based on [O III]. We estimate a BH
mass=10^9 Msun using 2 independent methods (H-beta line width & SED fits).
Blue-shifted absorption (-950km/s & -75km/s) is seen for the 1st time in STIS
UV spectra from Ly-alpha, NV, & CIV. The higher velocity UV lines are
coincident with the lower-ionisation (xi~1.6) X-ray warm absorber lines. A
dusty multiple ionization absorber blueshifted by 700-900km/s is required to
fit the X-ray data. Theoretical models comparing different ionising SEDs reveal
that a UV-inclusive (i.e., the accretion disc) ionising continuum strongly
impacts conclusions for the thermodynamic stability of the warm absorber.
Specific to IRAS13349, an Xray-UV ionising SED favors a continuous distribution
of ionisation states in a smooth flow (this paper), versus discrete clouds in
pressure equilibrium (work by others where UV is omitted). Direct dust
detections are seen in both the IR: PAH emission at (7.7 & 11.3)micron which
may also be blended with forsterite, and (10 & 18)micron silicate emission, and
X-rays: iron dust with a dust-to-gas ratio > 90%. We develop a geometrical
model whereby the QSO nuclear region is viewed through the upper atmosphere of
an obscuring torus. This sight line is obscured by dust that blocks a direct
view of the UV/optical emission region but is largely transparent in X-rays
since the gas is ionised. In our model, 20% of the intrinsic UV/optical
continuum is scattered into our sight line by the far wall of an obscuring
torus. An additional 2.4% of the direct light, which likely dominates the UV
emission, is Thomson-scattered into our line-of-sight by another off-plane
component of highly ionized gas.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0716v1,Radio Astronomy in LSST Era,"  A community meeting on the topic of ""Radio Astronomy in the LSST Era"" was
hosted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, VA (2013
May 6--8). The focus of the workshop was on time domain radio astronomy and sky
surveys. For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength
observations are required to understand several classes of transients was
stressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible
wavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.
From the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1
million alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification
and identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can
warrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a
deep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion
objects in it. Deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on a
comparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are part
of the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand these
objects. Radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dust
obscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formation
and from active galactic nuclei. The workshop touched on several other topics,
on which there was consensus including the placement of other LSST ""Deep
Drilling Fields,"" inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge of
filtering and exploiting the LSST data stream. There were also topics for which
there was insufficient time for full discussion or for which no consensus was
reached, which included the procedures for following up on LSST observations

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0947v1,Characterization of the Benchmark Binary NLTT 33370,"  We report the confirmation of the binary nature of the nearby, very low-mass
system NLTT 33370 with adaptive optics imaging and present resolved
near-infrared photometry and integrated light optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy to characterize the system. VLT-NaCo and LBTI-LMIRCam images show
significant orbital motion between 2013 February and 2013 April. Optical
spectra reveal weak, gravity sensitive alkali lines and strong lithium 6708
Angstrom absorption that indicate the system is younger than field age.
VLT-SINFONI near-IR spectra also show weak, gravity sensitive features and
spectral morphology that is consistent with other young, very low-mass dwarfs.
We combine the constraints from all age diagnostics to estimate a system age of
~30-200 Myr. The 1.2-4.7 micron spectral energy distribution of the components
point toward T_eff=3200 +/- 500 K and T_eff=3100 +/- 500 K for NLTT 33370 A and
B, respectively. The observed spectra, derived temperatures, and estimated age
combine to constrain the component spectral types to the range M6-M8.
Evolutionary models predict masses of 113 +/- 8 M_Jup and 106 +/- 7 M_Jup from
the estimated luminosities of the components. KPNO-Phoenix spectra allow us to
estimate the systemic radial velocity of the binary. The Galactic kinematics of
NLTT 33370AB are broadly consistent with other young stars in the Solar
neighborhood. However, definitive membership in a young, kinematic group cannot
be assigned at this time and further follow-up observations are necessary to
fully constrain the system's kinematics. The proximity, age, and late-spectral
type of this binary make it very novel and an ideal target for rapid, complete
orbit determination. The system is one of only a few model calibration
benchmarks at young ages and very low-masses.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2292v2,NuSTAR J163433-4738.7: A Fast X-ray Transient in the Galactic Plane,"  During hard X-ray observations of the Norma spiral arm region by the Nuclear
Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) in 2013 February, a new transient
source, NuSTAR J163433-4738.7, was detected at a significance level of 8-sigma
in the 3-10 keV bandpass. The source is consistent with having a constant
NuSTAR count rate over a period of 40 ks and is also detected simultaneously by
Swift at lower significance. The source is not significantly detected by
NuSTAR, Swift, or Chandra in the days before or weeks after the discovery of
the transient, indicating that the strong X-ray activity lasted for between
~0.5 and 1.5 days. Near-IR imaging observations were carried out before and
after the X-ray activity, but we are not able to identify the counterpart. The
combined NuSTAR and Swift energy spectrum is consistent with a power-law with a
photon index of Gamma = 4.1(+1.5)(-1.0) (90% confidence errors), a blackbody
with kT = 1.2+/-0.3 keV, or a bremsstrahlung model with kT = 3.0(+2.1)(-1.2)
keV. The reduced-chi2 values for the three models are not significantly
different, ranging from 1.23 to 1.44 for 8 degrees of freedom. The spectrum is
strongly absorbed with NH = 2.8(+2.3)(-1.4)e23 cm-2, 9(+15)(-7)e22 cm-2, and
1.7(+1.7)(-0.9)e23 cm-2, for the power-law, blackbody, and bremsstrahlung
models, respectively. Although the high column density could be due to material
local to the source, it is consistent with absorption from interstellar
material along the line of sight at a distance of 11 kpc, which would indicate
an X-ray luminosity >1e34 erg/s. Although we do not reach a definitive
determination of the nature of NuSTAR J163433-4738.7, we suggest that it may be
an unusually bright active binary or a magnetar.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4302v3,BICEP2 II: Experiment and Three-Year Data Set,"  We report on the design and performance of the BICEP2 instrument and on its
three-year data set. BICEP2 was designed to measure the polarization of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) on angular scales of 1 to 5 degrees
($\ell$=40-200), near the expected peak of the B-mode polarization signature of
primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inflation. Measuring B-modes
requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control
of systematics. The BICEP2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26~cm
aperture and cold, on-axis, refractive optics. BICEP2 also adopted a new
detector design in which beam-defining slot antenna arrays couple to
transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers, all fabricated on a common substrate.
The antenna-coupled TES detectors supported scalable fabrication and
multiplexed readout that allowed BICEP2 to achieve a high detector count of 500
bolometers at 150 GHz, giving unprecedented sensitivity to B-modes at degree
angular scales. After optimization of detector and readout parameters, BICEP2
achieved an instrument noise-equivalent temperature of 15.8 $\mu$K sqrt(s). The
full data set reached Stokes Q and U map depths of 87.2 nK in square-degree
pixels (5.2 $\mu$K arcmin) over an effective area of 384 square degrees within
a 1000 square degree field. These are the deepest CMB polarization maps at
degree angular scales to date. The power spectrum analysis presented in a
companion paper has resulted in a significant detection of B-mode polarization
at degree scales.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3806v1,"ZFOURGE/CANDELS: On the Evolution of M* Galaxy Progenitors from z=3 to
  0.5","  Galaxies with stellar masses near M* contain the majority of stellar mass in
the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy
evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present day stellar
masses near M*, at 5x10^10 Msol (MW-mass) and 10^11 Msol (M31-mass). We study
the typical progenitors of these galaxies using ZFOURGE, a deep medium-band
near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies
out to z~3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main
progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in
the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and
star-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR
HST imaging from CANDELS, and far-IR imaging from GOODS-H and CANDELS-H. The
typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution
stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,
to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and to
red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the
MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower
redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than the
progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution,
including the suppression of star-formation in present-day M* galaxies requires
an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold
for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and star-formation rates imply that
the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to
z~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the S\'ersic index.
Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M* galaxies corresponds to a rapid
decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formation
efficiency.

and confirm that this is not due to systematics using jackknife tests and
simulations based on detailed calibration measurements. In map difference and
spectral difference tests these new data are shown to be consistent with
BICEP2. Finally, we combine the maps from the two experiments to produce final
Q and U maps which have a depth of 57 nK deg (3.4 $\mu$K arcmin) over an

accreting X-ray pulsar 2RXP J130159.6-635806. The source was serendipitously
observed during a campaign focused on the gamma-ray binary PSR B1259-63 and was
later targeted for a dedicated observation. The spectrum has a typical shape
for accreting X-ray pulsars, consisting of a simple power law with an
exponential cutoff starting at ~7 keV with a folding energy of E_fold=~18 keV.
There is also an indication of the presence of a 6.4 keV iron line in the
spectrum at the ~3 sigma significance level. NuSTAR measurements of the
pulsation period reveal that the pulsar has undergone a strong and steady
spin-up for the last 20 years. The pulsed fraction is estimated to be ~80%, and
is constant with energy up to 40 keV. The power density spectrum shows a break
towards higher frequencies relative to the current spin period. This, together
with steady persistent luminosity, points to a long-term mass accretion rate
high enough to bring the pulsar out of spin equilibrium.

the astronomy and physics communities, revealing astrophysical phenomena from
the Solar System to the outer reaches of the observable Universe. While many
discoveries will be made using LSST data alone, taking full scientific
advantage of LSST will require ground-based optical-infrared (OIR) supporting
capabilities, e.g., observing time on telescopes, instrumentation, computing
resources, and other infrastructure. This community-based study identifies,
from a science-driven perspective, capabilities that are needed to maximize
LSST science. Expanding on the initial steps taken in the 2015 OIR System
Report, the study takes a detailed, quantitative look at the capabilities
needed to accomplish six representative LSST-enabled science programs that
connect closely with scientific priorities from the 2010 decadal surveys. The
study prioritizes the resources needed to accomplish the science programs and
highlights ways that existing, planned, and future resources could be
positioned to accomplish the science goals.

by the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields Initiative (HSTFF): Abell 2744 (z
= 0.308), MACSJ0416, (z = 0.396) and MACSJ1149 (z = 0.543). Statistically
resolving dark-matter subhaloes down to ~10^{9.5} solar masses, we compare the
derived subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) to theoretical predictions from
analytical models and with numerical simulations in a Lambda Cold Dark Matter
(LCDM) cosmology. Mimicking our observational cluster member selection criteria
in the HSTFF, we report excellent agreement in both amplitude and shape of the
SHMF over four decades in subhalo mass (10^{9-13} solar masses). Projection
effects do not appear to introduce significant errors in the determination of
SHMFs from simulations. We do not find evidence for a substructure crisis,
analogous to the missing satellite problem in the Local Group, on cluster
scales, but rather excellent agreement of the count-matched HSTFF SHMF down to
M_{sub halo}/M_{halo} ~ 10^{-5}. However, we do find discrepancies in the
radial distribution of sub haloes inferred from HSTFF cluster lenses compared
to determinations from simulated clusters. This suggests that although the
selected simulated clusters match the HSTFF sample in mass, they do not
adequately capture the dynamical properties and complex merging morphologies of
these observed cluster lenses. Therefore, HSTFF clusters are likely observed in
a transient evolutionary stage that is presently insufficiently sampled in
cosmological simulations. The abundance and mass function of dark matter
substructure in cluster lenses continues to offer an important test of the LCDM
paradigm, and at present we find no tension between model predictions and
observations.

sequence, the latter spanning $-0.7<$[Fe/H]$<+0.5$. While these two sequences
become indistinguishable in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] at the metal-rich regime,

stars ($>8$ Gyr have lower angular momenta $L_z$ than the Sun, which implies
that they are on eccentric orbits & originate from the inner disk. Contrary to
some previous smaller scale studies we find a continuous evolution in the
high-$\alpha$-sequence up to super-solar [Fe/H] rather than a gap, which has
been interpreted as a separate ""high-$\alpha$ metal-rich"" population. Stars in
our sample that are younger than 10 Gyr, are mainly found on the low
$\alpha$-sequence & show a gradient in $L_z$ from low [Fe/H]
($L_z>L_{z,\odot}$) towards higher [Fe/H] ($L_z<L_{z,\odot}$), which implies

http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3899v1,Imaging an Event Horizon: submm-VLBI of a Super Massive Black Hole,"  A long standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe the immediate
environment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the event
horizon. Realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of General
Relativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at the
edge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental black
hole physics (e.g., spin). Steady long-term progress on improving the
capability of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at short wavelengths has
now made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the next
decade. The most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by
1.3mm VLBI of Schwarzschild radius scale structure in SgrA*, the compact source
of radio, submm, NIR and xrays at the center of the Milky Way. SgrA* is thought
to mark the position of a ~4 million solar mass black hole, and because of its
proximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon size
of any black hole candidate in the Universe. Over the next decade, existing and
planned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, high
angular resolution ""Event Horizon Telescope"" that will bring us as close to the
edge of black hole as we will come for decades. This white paper describes the
science case for mm/submm VLBI observations of both SgrA* and M87 (a radio loud
AGN of a much more luminous class that SgrA*). We emphasize that while there is
development and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, and
the recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that would
normally be associated with such an ambitious project.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06780v1,The Accreting Black Hole Swift J1753.5-0127 from Radio to Hard X-Ray,"  (abridged) We report on multi-wavelength measurements of Swift J1753.5-0127
in the hard state at L=2.7e36 erg/s (assuming d=3 kpc) in 2014. The radio
emission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. We take
advantage of the low extinction and model the near-IR to UV emission with a
multi-temperature disk model. Assuming a BH mass of M_BH=5 Msun and a system
inclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk of
Rin/Rg>212 d_3 (5Msun/M_BH). The outer radius is R_out/R_g=90,000 d_3
(5Msun/M_BH), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expected
size of the disk. The 0.5-240 keV spectrum measured by Swift/XRT, Suzaku, and
NuSTAR is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index of
Gamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a second
continuum component is added. Reflection is a possibility, but no iron line is
detected, implying a low iron abundance. We are able to fit the entire SED with
a multi-temperature disk component, a Comptonization component, and a broken
power-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. The broken power-law
cannot significantly contribute to the soft X-ray emission, and this may be
related to why Swift J1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/X-ray correlation.
The broken power-law might dominate above 20 keV, which would constrain the
break frequency to be between 2.4e10 Hz and 3.6e12 Hz. Although the fits to the
full SED do not include significant thermal emission in the X-ray band,
previous observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find that
there is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with a
temperature of 150(+30)(-20) eV and an inner radius of 5-14 R_g. If this
component is real, it might imply the presence of an inner accretion disk in
addition to the strongly truncated (R_in>212 R_g) disk.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04472v2,"The SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Quasar
  Target Selection","  As part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV the extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will improve measurements of the cosmological
distance scale by applying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method to
quasar samples. eBOSS will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq.
deg. First, a ""CORE"" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugriz
using a likelihood-based routine called XDQSOz, with a mid-IR-optical
color-cut. eBOSS CORE selection (to g < 22 OR r < 22) should return ~ 70
quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 < z < 2.2 and ~7 z > 2.1 quasars per sq.
deg. Second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from the
Palomar Transient Factory should recover an additional ~3-4 z > 2.1 quasars per
sq. deg. to g < 22.5. A linear model of how imaging systematics affect target
density recovers the angular distribution of eBOSS CORE quasars over 96.7%
(76.7%) of the SDSS North (South) Galactic Cap area. The eBOSS CORE quasar
sample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 < z < 2.2 to
yield the first few-percent-level BAO constraint near z~1.5. eBOSS quasars at z
> 2.1 will be used to improve BAO measurements in the Lyman-alpha Forest.
Beyond its key cosmological goals, eBOSS should be the next-generation quasar
survey, comprising > 500,000 new quasars and > 500,000 uniformly selected
spectroscopically confirmed 0.9 < z < 2.2 quasars. At the conclusion of eBOSS,
the SDSS will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.

  II. The Nondip Spectrum in the Low/Hard State - Modulations with Orbital
  Phase","  The accretion onto the black hole in the system HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 is
powered by the strong line driven stellar wind of the O-type donor star. We
study the X-ray properties of the stellar wind in the hard state of Cyg X-1 as
determined with data from the Chandra High Energy Transmission Gratings. Large
density and temperature inhomogeneities are present in the wind, with a
fraction of the wind consisting of clumps of matter with higher density and
lower temperature embedded in a photoionized gas. Absorption dips observed in
the light curve are believed to be caused by these clumps. This work
concentrates on the non-dip spectra as a function of orbital phase. The spectra
show lines of H-like and He-like ions of S, Si, Na, Mg, Al and highly ionized
Fe (Fe xvii-Fe xxiv). We measure velocity shifts, column densities, and thermal
broadening of the line series. The excellent quality of these five observations
allows us to investigate the orbital phase dependence of these parameters. We
show that the absorber is located close to the black hole. Doppler shifted
lines point at a complex wind structure in this region, while emission lines
seen in some observations are from a denser medium than the absorber. The
observed line profiles are phase dependent. Their shapes vary from pure,
symmetric absorption at the superior conjunction to P Cygni profiles at the
inferior conjunction of the black hole.

Physikshow of Bonn University. The show is addressed at non-physicists aged 14+
and communicates basic concepts of elementary particle physics including the
discovery of the Higgs boson in an entertaining fashion. It is also
demonstrates a successful outreach activity heavily relying on the university
physics students. This paper is addressed at anybody interested in particle
physics and/or show physics. This paper is also addressed at fellow physicists
working in outreach, maybe the experiments and our choice of simple
explanations will be helpful. Furthermore, we are very interested in related
activities elsewhere, in particular also demonstration experiments relevant to
particle physics, as often little of this work is published.
  Our show involves 28 live demonstration experiments. These are presented in
an extensive appendix, including photos and technical details. The show is set
up as a quest, where 2 students from Bonn with the aid of a caretaker travel
back in time to understand the fundamental nature of matter. They visit
Rutherford and Geiger in Manchester around 1911, who recount their famous
experiment on the nucleus and show how particle detectors work. They travel
forward in time to meet Lawrence at Berkeley around 1950, teaching them about
the how and why of accelerators. Next, they visit Wu at DESY, Hamburg, around
1980, who explains the strong force. They end up in the LHC tunnel at CERN,
Geneva, Switzerland in 2012. Two experimentalists tell them about colliders and
our heroes watch live as the Higgs boson is produced and decays. The show was
presented in English at Oxford University and University College London, as
well as Padua University and ICTP Trieste. It was 1st performed in German at

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07118v2,"The Ultra-Fast Outflow of the Quasar PG 1211+143 as Viewed by
  Time-Averaged Chandra Grating Spectroscopy","  We present a detailed X-ray spectral study of the quasar PG 1211+143 based on
Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observations
collected in a multi-wavelength campaign with UV data using the Hubble Space
Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST-COS) and radio bands using the
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We constructed a multi-wavelength ionizing
spectral energy distribution using these observations and archival infrared
data to create XSTAR photoionization models specific to the PG 1211+143 flux
behavior during the epoch of our observations. Our analysis of the
Chandra-HETGS spectra yields complex absorption lines from H-like and He-like
ions of Ne, Mg and Si which confirm the presence of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO)
with a velocity ~ $-$17,300 km s$^{-1}$ (outflow redshift $z_{\rm out}$ ~
$-$0.0561) in the rest frame of PG 1211+143. This absorber is well described by
an ionization parameter $\log \xi$ ~ 2.9 erg s$^{-1}$ cm and column density
$\log N_{\rm H}$ ~ 21.5 cm$^{-2}$. This corresponds to a stable region of the
absorber's thermal stability curve, and furthermore its implied neutral
hydrogen column is broadly consistent with a broad Ly$\alpha$ absorption line
at a mean outflow velocity of ~ $-$16,980 km s$^{-1}$ detected by our HST-COS
observations. Our findings represent the first simultaneous detection of a UFO
in both X-ray and UV observations. Our VLA observations provide evidence for an
active jet in PG 1211+143, which may be connected to the X-ray and UV outflows;
this possibility can be evaluated using very-long-baseline interferometric
(VLBI) observations.

  using NH3","  We present combined observations of the NH3 (J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversion
transitions towards OMC1 in Orion A obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA) and the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). With an
angular resolution of 6"" (0.01 pc), these observations reveal with
unprecedented detail the complex filamentary structure extending north of the
active Orion BN/KL region in a field covering 6' x 7'. We find a 0.012 pc wide
filament within OMC1, with an aspect ratio of ~37:1, that was missed in
previous studies. Its orientation is directly compared to the relative
orientation of the magnetic field from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope BISTRO
survey in Orion A. We find a small deviation of ~11 deg between the mean
orientation of the filament and the magnetic field, suggesting that they are
almost parallel to one another. The filament's column density is estimated to
be 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than the filaments studied with Herschel and
is possibly self-gravitating given the low values of turbulence found. We
further produce maps of the gas kinematics by forward modeling the hyperfine
structure of the NH3 (J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) lines. The resulting distribution
of velocity dispersions peaks at ~0.5 km/s, close to the subsonic regime of the
gas. This value is about 0.2 km/s smaller than previously measured in
single-dish observations of the same region, suggesting that higher angular and
spectral resolution observations will identify even lower velocity dispersions
that might reach the subsonic turbulence regime in dense gas filaments.

All-sky Near-infrared Optical SETI (PANOSETI) observatory will be a dedicated
SETI facility that aims to increase sky area searched, wavelengths covered,
number of stellar systems observed, and duration of time monitored. This
observatory will offer an ""all-observable-sky"" optical and wide-field
near-infrared pulsed technosignature and astrophysical transient search that is
capable of surveying the entire northern hemisphere. The final implemented
experiment will search for transient pulsed signals occurring between
nanosecond to second time scales. The optical component will cover a solid
angle 2.5 million times larger than current SETI targeted searches, while also
increasing dwell time per source by a factor of 10,000. The PANOSETI instrument
will be the first near-infrared wide-field SETI program ever conducted. The
rapid technological advance of fast-response optical and near-infrared detector
arrays (i.e., Multi-Pixel Photon Counting; MPPC) make this program now
feasible. The PANOSETI instrument design uses innovative domes that house 100
Fresnel lenses, which will search concurrently over 8,000 square degrees for
transient signals (see Maire et al. and Cosens et al., this conference). In
this paper, we describe the overall instrumental specifications and science
objectives for PANOSETI.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08213v2,Carnegie Supernova Project-II: The Near-infrared Spectroscopy Program,"  Shifting the focus of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology to the
near-infrared (NIR) is a promising way to significantly reduce the systematic
errors, as the strategy minimizes our reliance on the empirical
width-luminosity relation and uncertain dust laws. Observations in the NIR are
also crucial for our understanding of the origins and evolution of these
events, further improving their cosmological utility. Any future experiments in
the rest-frame NIR will require knowledge of the SN Ia NIR spectroscopic
diversity, which is currently based on a small sample of observed spectra.
Along with the accompanying paper, Phillips et al. (2018), we introduce the
Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), to follow up nearby SNe Ia in both the
optical and the NIR. In particular, this paper focuses on the CSP-II NIR
spectroscopy program, describing the survey strategy, instrumental setups, data
reduction, sample characteristics, and future analyses on the data set. In
collaboration with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA)
Supernova Group, we obtained 661 NIR spectra of 157 SNe Ia. Within this sample,
451 NIR spectra of 90 SNe Ia have corresponding CSP-II follow-up light curves.
Such a sample will allow detailed studies of the NIR spectroscopic properties
of SNe Ia, providing a different perspective on the properties of the unburned
material, radioactive and stable nickel produced, progenitor magnetic fields,
and searches for possible signatures of companion stars.

with stellar mass $10^{10.7}\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \leqslant M_{\ast} \leqslant
10^{11.9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, the total power-law slope has a mean of
$\langle\gamma^{\prime}\rangle = 2.011 \pm 0.007$ and a scatter of
$\sigma_{\gamma^{\prime}} = 0.171$ over the radial range 0.4 to 4 times the
stellar half mass radius. Several correlations between $\gamma^{\prime}$ and
galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius, stellar surface
density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction and
in-situ-formed stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other
simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG reproduces many correlation trends,
and in particular, $\gamma^{\prime}$ is almost constant with redshift below $z
= 2$. Through analyzing IllustrisTNG model variations we show that black hole
kinetic winds are crucial to lowering $\gamma^{\prime}$ and matching observed
galaxy correlations. The effects of stellar winds on $\gamma^{\prime}$ are
subdominant compared to AGN feedback, and differ due to the presence of AGN
feedback from previous works. The density profiles of the ETG dark matter halos
are well-described by steeper-than-NFW profiles, and they are steeper in the
full physics (FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter only (DMO)
run. Their inner density slopes anti-correlates (remain constant) with the halo
mass in the FP (DMO) run, and anti-correlates with the halo concentration
parameter $c_{200}$ in both types of runs. The dark matter halos of low-mass
ETGs are contracted whereas high-mass ETGs are expanded, suggesting that
variations in the total density profile occur through the different halo
responses to baryons.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10820v1,"The Young and Nearby Normal Type Ia Supernova 2018gv: UV-Optical
  Observations and the Earliest Spectropolarimetry","  The non-detection of companion stars in Type Ia supernova (SN) progenitor
systems lends support to the notion of double-degenerate (DD) systems and
explosions triggered by the merging of two white dwarfs. This very asymmetric
process should lead to a conspicuous polarimetric signature. By contrast,
observations consistently find very low continuum polarization as the
signatures from the explosion process largely dominate over the pre-explosion
configuration within several days. Critical information about the interaction
of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is encoded in the
early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of
SN\,2018gv with the ESO Very Large Telescope at $-$13.6 days relative to the
$B-$band maximum light, or $\sim$5 days after the estimated explosion --- the
earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date of any Type Ia SN. These
early observations still show a low continuum polarization ($\lesssim$0.2\%)
and moderate line polarization (0.30$\pm$0.04\% for the prominent \ion{Si}{2}
$\lambda$6355 feature and 0.85$\pm$0.04\% for the high-velocity Ca component).
The high degree of spherical symmetry implied by the low line and continuum
polarization at this early epoch is consistent with explosion models of delayed
detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. The
dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11130v1,Imprint of Drivers of Galaxy Formation in the Circumgalactic Medium,"  The majority of baryons reside beyond the optical extent of a galaxy in the
circumgalactic and intergalactic media (CGM/IGM). Gaseous halos are
inextricably linked to the appearance of their host galaxies through a complex
story of accretion, feedback, and continual recycling. The energetic processes,
which define the state of gas in the CGM, are the same ones that 1) regulate
stellar growth so that it is not over-efficient, and 2) create the diversity of
today's galaxy colors, SFRs, and morphologies spanning Hubble's Tuning Fork
Diagram. They work in concert to set the speed of growth on the star-forming
Main Sequence, transform a galaxy across the Green Valley, and maintain a
galaxy's quenched appearance on the Red Sequence. Most baryons in halos more
massive than 10^12 Msolar along with their high-energy physics and dynamics
remain invisible because that gas is heated above the UV ionization states. We
argue that information on many of the essential drivers of galaxy evolution is
primarily contained in this ""missing"" hot gas phase. Completing the picture of
galaxy formation requires uncovering the physical mechanisms behind stellar and
SMBH feedback driving mass, metals, and energy into the CGM. By opening
galactic hot halos to new wavebands, we not only obtain fossil imprints of >13
Gyrs of evolution, but observe on-going hot-mode accretion, the deposition of
superwind outflows into the CGM, and the re-arrangement of baryons by SMBH
feedback. A description of the flows of mass, metals, and energy will only be
complete by observing the thermodynamic states, chemical compositions,
structure, and dynamics of T>=10^6 K halos. These measurements are uniquely
possible with a next-generation X-ray observatory if it provides the
sensitivity to detect faint CGM emission, spectroscopic power to measure
absorption lines and gas motions, and high spatial resolution to resolve
structures.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04320v1,X-ray Studies of Exoplanets: A 2020 Decadal Survey White Paper,"  Over the last two decades, the discovery of exoplanets has fundamentally
changed our perception of the universe and humanity's place within it. Recent
work indicates that a solar system's X-ray and high energy particle environment
is of fundamental importance to the formation and development of the
atmospheres of close-in planets such as hot Jupiters, and Earth-like planets
around M stars. X-ray imaging and spectroscopy provide powerful and unique
windows into the high energy flux that an exoplanet experiences, and X-ray
photons also serve as proxies for potentially transfigurative coronal mass
ejections. Finally, if the host star is a bright enough X-ray source, transit
measurements akin to those in the optical and infrared are possible and allow
for direct characterization of the upper atmospheres of exoplanets. In this
brief white paper, we discuss contributions to the study of exoplanets and
their environs which can be made by X-ray data of increasingly high quality
that are achievable in the next 10--15 years.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07193v1,"A DECam Search for Explosive Optical Transients Associated with IceCube
  Neutrinos","  To facilitate multimessenger studies with TeV and PeV astrophysical
neutrinos, the IceCube Collaboration has developed a realtime alert system for
the highest confidence and best localized neutrino events. In this work we
investigate the likelihood of association between realtime high-energy neutrino
alerts and explosive optical transients, with a focus on core-collapse
supernovae (CC SNe) as candidate neutrino sources. We report results from
triggered optical follow-up observations of two IceCube alerts, IC170922A and
IC171106A, with Blanco/DECam ($gri$ to 24th magnitude in $\sim6$ epochs). Based
on a suite of simulated supernova light curves, we develop and validate
selection criteria for CC SNe exploding in coincidence with neutrino alerts.
The DECam observations are sensitive to CC SNe at redshifts $z \lesssim 0.3$.
At redshifts $z \lesssim 0.1$, our selection criteria reduce background SNe
contamination to a level below the predicted signal. For the IC170922A
(IC171106A) follow-up observations, we expect that 12.1% (9.5%) of coincident
CC SNe at $z \lesssim 0.3$ are recovered, and that on average, 0.23 (0.07)
unassociated SNe in the 90% containment regions also pass our selection
criteria. We find two total candidate CC SNe that are temporally coincident
with the neutrino alerts, but none in the 90% containment regions, which is
statistically consistent with expected rates of background CC SNe for these
observations. Given the signal efficiencies and background rates derived from
this pilot study, we estimate that to determine whether CC SNe are the dominant
contribution to the total TeV-PeV energy IceCube neutrino flux at the $3\sigma$
confidence level, DECam observations similar to those of this work would be
needed for $\sim200$ neutrino alerts, though this number falls to $\sim60$
neutrino alerts if redshift information is available for all candidates.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01597v1,ALMA resolves the hourglass magnetic field in G31.41+0.31,"  Context. Submillimeter Array (SMA) 870 micron polarization observations of
the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 revealed one of the clearest examples up to
date of an hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology in a high-mass
star-forming region. Aims. To better establish the role that the magnetic field
plays in the collapse of G31.41+0.31, we carried out Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the polarized dust
continuum emission at 1.3 mm with an angular resolution four times higher than
that of the previous (sub)millimeter observations to achieve an unprecedented
image of the magnetic field morphology. Methods. We used ALMA to perform full
polarization observations at 233 GHz (Band 6). The resulting synthesized beam
is 0.28""x0""20 which, at the distance of the source, corresponds to a spatial
resolution of ~875 au. Results. The observations resolve the structure of the
magnetic field in G31.41+0.31 and allow us to study the field in detail. The
polarized emission in the Main core of G31.41+0.41is successfully fit with a
semi-analytical magnetostatic model of a toroid supported by magnetic fields.
The best fit model suggests that the magnetic field is well represented by a
poloidal field with a possible contribution of a toroidal component of ~10% of
the poloidal component, oriented southeast to northwest at ~ -44 deg and with
an inclination of ~-45 degr. The magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to
the northeast to southwest velocity gradient detected in this core on scales
from 1E3-1E4 au. This supports the hypothesis that the velocity gradient is due
to rotation and suggests that such a rotation has little effect on the magnetic
field. The strength of the magnetic field estimated in the central region of
the core with the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method is ~8-13 mG and implies that
the mass-to-flux ratio in this region is slightly supercritical ...

http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04488v1,"The CARMA-NRO Orion Survey: Core Emergence and Kinematics in the Orion A
  Cloud","  We have investigated the formation and kinematics of sub-mm continuum cores
in the Orion A molecular cloud. A comparison between sub-mm continuum and near
infrared extinction shows a continuum core detection threshold of $A_V\sim$
5-10 mag. The threshold is similar to the star formation extinction threshold
of $A_V\sim$ 7 mag proposed by recent work, suggesting a universal star
formation extinction threshold among clouds within 500 pc to the Sun. A
comparison between the Orion A cloud and a massive infrared dark cloud
G28.37+0.07 indicates that Orion A produces more dense gas within the
extinction range 15 mag $\lesssim A_V \lesssim$ 60 mag. Using data from the
CARMA-NRO Orion Survey, we find that dense cores in the integral-shaped
filament (ISF) show sub-sonic core-to-envelope velocity dispersion that is
significantly less than the local envelope line dispersion, similar to what has
been found in nearby clouds. Dynamical analysis indicates that the cores are
bound to the ISF. An oscillatory core-to-envelope motion is detected along the
ISF. Its origin is to be further explored.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07538v1,Dynamical Relics of the Ancient Galactic Halo,"  We search for dynamical substructures in the LAMOST DR3 very metal-poor (VMP)
star catalog. After cross-matching with Gaia DR2, there are 3300 VMP stars with
available high-quality astrometric information that have halo-like kinematics.
We apply a method based on self-organizing maps to find groups clustered in the
4D space of orbital energy and angular momentum. We identify 57 dynamically
tagged groups, which we label DTG-1 to DTG-57. Most of them belong to existing
substructures in the nearby halo, such as the $Gaia$ Sausage or Sequoia. The
stream identified by Helmi et al. is recovered, but the two disjoint portions
of the substructure have distinct dynamical properties. The very retrograde
substructure Rg5 found previously by Myeong et al. is also retrieved. We report
6 new DTGs with highly retrograde orbits, 2 with very prograde orbits, and 12
with polar orbits. By mapping other datasets (APOGEE halo stars, and catalogs
of r-process-enhanced and CEMP stars) onto the trained neuron map, we can
associate stars with detailed chemical abundances to the DTGs, and look for
associations with chemically peculiar stars. The highly eccentric $Gaia$
Sausage groups contain representatives both of debris from the satellite itself
(which is $\alpha$-poor) and the Splashed Disk, sent up into eccentric halo
orbits from the encounter (and is $\alpha$-rich). The new prograde
substructures also appear to be associated with the Splashed Disk. The DTGs
belonging to the $Gaia$ Sausage host two relatively metal-rich $r$-II stars and
six CEMP stars in different sub-classes, consistent with the idea that the
$Gaia$ Sausage progenitor is a massive dwarf galaxy. Rg5 is dynamically
associated with two highly $r$-process-enhanced stars with [Fe/H] $\sim -$3.
This finding indicates that its progenitor might be an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy
that has experienced $r$-process enrichment from neutron star mergers.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08028v1,"ESA Voyage 2050 white paper -- Faint objects in motion: the new frontier
  of high precision astrometry","  Sky survey telescopes and powerful targeted telescopes play complementary
roles in astronomy. In order to investigate the nature and characteristics of
the motions of very faint objects, a flexibly-pointed instrument capable of
high astrometric accuracy is an ideal complement to current astrometric surveys
and a unique tool for precision astrophysics. Such a space-based mission will
push the frontier of precision astrometry from evidence of earth-massed
habitable worlds around the nearest starts, and also into distant Milky way
objects up to the Local Group of galaxies. As we enter the era of the James
Webb Space Telescope and the new ground-based, adaptive-optics-enabled giant
telescopes, by obtaining these high precision measurements on key objects that
Gaia could not reach, a mission that focuses on high precision astrometry
science can consolidate our theoretical understanding of the local universe,
enable extrapolation of physical processes to remote redshifts, and derive a
much more consistent picture of cosmological evolution and the likely fate of
our cosmos. Already several missions have been proposed to address the science
case of faint objects in motion using high precision astrometry ESA missions:
NEAT for M3, micro-NEAT for S1 mission, and Theia for M4 and M5. Additional new
mission configurations adapted with technological innovations could be
envisioned to pursue accurate measurements of these extremely small motions.
The goal of this white paper is to address the fundamental science questions
that are at stake when we focus on the motions of faint sky objects and to
briefly review quickly instrumentation and mission profiles.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12739v1,The Case for Probe-class NASA Astrophysics Missions,"  Astrophysics spans an enormous range of questions on scales from individual
planets to the entire cosmos. To address the richness of 21st century
astrophysics requires a corresponding richness of telescopes spanning all bands
and all messengers. Much scientific benefit comes from having the
multi-wavelength capability available at the same time. Most of these bands,or
measurement sensitivities, require space-based missions. Historically, NASA has
addressed this need for breadth with a small number of flagship-class missions
and a larger number of Explorer missions. While the Explorer program continues
to flourish, there is a large gap between Explorers and strategic missions. A
fortunate combination of new astrophysics technologies with new, high capacity,
low dollar-per-kg to orbit launchers, and new satellite buses allow for cheaper
missions with capabilities approaching strategic mission levels. NASA has
recognized these developments by calling for Probe-class mission ideas for
mission studies, spanning most of the electromagnetic spectrum from GeV
gamma-rays to the far infrared, and the new messengers of neutrinos and
ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The key insight from the Probes exercise is that
order-of-magnitude advances in science performance metrics are possible across
the board for initial total cost estimates in the range 500M-1B dollars.

TESS data. The object is unresolved in Gaia and appears as a single source at

these data, spectroscopy, speckle photometry, SED analysis and evolutionary
stellar tracks, we have constrained the masses and radii of the four stars in

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11358v1,A possible polar origin for the FRB associated with a Galactic magnetar,"  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-long radio pulses of extragalactic
origin with peak luminosities far exceeding any Milky Way sources. The
prevalent invocation for the FRB origin involves magnetars: young, magnetically
powered neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. A
magnetar-defining signature is the emission of bright, hard X-ray bursts of
sub-second duration. These occur in isolation or during a burst storm, when
several hundred are observed within minutes to hours. On April 27th 2020, the
Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active period, emitting hundreds of
X-ray bursts in a few hours. Remarkably, only one of these temporally coincided
with an FRB-like radio burst. Here we report on the spectral and temporal
analyses of 24 X-ray bursts emitted 13 hours prior to the FRB and seen
simultaneously with NASA NICER and Fermi/GBM missions in their combined energy
range. We demonstrate that the FRB-associated X-ray burst is very similar
temporally, albeit strikingly different spectrally, from the 24 NICER/GBM
bursts. If the FRB-associated burst were drawn from this magnetar burst
population, its occurrence rate would be at most around 1 in 7000. This rarity
combined with the unusual X-ray burst spectrum is perhaps indicative of an
uncommon locale for the origin of the FRB-associated burst. We suggest that
this unique event originated in quasi-polar open or closed magnetic field lines
extending to high altitudes where radio emission can be generated, possibly
from a collimated plasma flow.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01950v1,"Ultra-high spatial resolution BOLD fMRI in humans using combined
  segmented-accelerated VFA-FLEET with a recursive RF pulse design","  Purpose
  To alleviate the spatial encoding limitations of single-shot EPI by
developing multi-shot segmented EPI for ultra-high-resolution fMRI with reduced
ghosting artifacts from subject motion and respiration.
  Methods
  Segmented EPI can reduce readout duration and reduce acceleration factors,
however, the time elapsed between segment acquisitions (on the order of
seconds) can result in intermittent ghosting, limiting its use for fMRI. Here,
""FLEET"" segment ordering--where segments are looped over before slices--was
combined with a variable flip angle progression (VFA-FLEET) to improve
inter-segment fidelity and maximize signal for fMRI. Scaling a sinc pulse's
flip angle for each segment (VFA-FLEET-Sinc) produced inconsistent slice
profiles and ghosting, therefore, a recursive Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) RF pulse
design was developed (VFA-FLEET-SLR) to generate unique pulses for every
segment that together produce consistent slice profiles and signals.
  Results
  The temporal stability of VFA-FLEET-SLR was compared against
conventional-segmented EPI and VFA-FLEET-Sinc at 3 T and 7 T. VFA-FLEET-SLR
showed reductions in both intermittent and stable ghosting compared to
conventional-segmented and VFA-FLEET-Sinc, resulting in improved image quality
with a minor trade-off in temporal SNR. Combining VFA-FLEET-SLR with
acceleration, we achieved a 0.6-mm isotropic acquisition at 7 T--without zoomed
imaging or partial Fourier--demonstrating reliable detection of BOLD responses
to a visual stimulus. To counteract the increased repetition time from
segmentation, simultaneous multi-slice VFA-FLEET-SLR was demonstrated using
RF-encoded controlled aliasing.
  Conclusions
  VFA-FLEET with a recursive RF pulse design supports acquisitions with low
levels of artifact and spatial blur, enabling fMRI at previously inaccessible
spatial resolutions with a ""full-brain"" field of view.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11373v1,X-ray Spectral and Timing evolution of MAXI J1727-203 with NICER,"  We present a detailed X-ray spectral and variability study of the full 2018
outburst of MAXI J1727-203 using NICER observations. The outburst lasted
approximately four months. Spectral modelling in the 0.3-10 keV band shows the
presence of both a soft thermal and a hard Comptonised component. The analysis
of these components shows that MAXI J1727-203 evolved through the soft,
intermediate and hard spectral states during the outburst. We find that the
soft (disc) component was detected throughout almost the entire outburst, with
temperatures ranging from ~0.4 keV, at the moment of maximum luminosity, to
~0.1 keV near the end of the outburst. The power spectrum in the hard and
intermediate states shows broadband noise up to 20 Hz, with no evidence of
quasi-periodic oscillations. We also study the rms spectra of the broadband
noise at 0.3-10 keV of this source. We find that the fractional rms increases
with energy in most of the outburst except during the hard state, where the
fractional rms remains approximately constant with energy. We also find that,
below 3 keV, the fractional rms follows the same trend generally observed at
energies >3 keV, a behaviour known from previous studies of black holes and
neutron stars. The spectral and timing evolution of MAXI J1727-203, as
parametrised by the hardness-intensity, hardness-rms, and rms-intensity

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13144v1,"PTF11rka: an interacting supernova at the crossroads of
  stripped-envelope and H-poor super-luminous stellar core collapses","  The hydrogen-poor supernova PTF11rka (z = 0.0744), reported by the Palomar
Transient Factory, was observed with various telescopes starting a few days
after the estimated explosion time of 2011 Dec. 5 UT and up to 432 rest-frame
days thereafter. The rising part of the light curve was monitored only in the
R_PTF filter band, and maximum in this band was reached ~30 rest-frame days
after the estimated explosion time. The light curve and spectra of PTF11rka are
consistent with the core-collapse explosion of a ~10 Msun carbon-oxygen core
evolved from a progenitor of main-sequence mass 25--40 Msun, that liberated a
kinetic energy (KE) ~ 4 x 10^{51} erg, expelled ~8 Msun of ejecta (Mej), and
synthesised ~0.5 Msun of 56Nichel. The photospheric spectra of PTF11rka are
characterised by narrow absorption lines that point to suppression of the
highest ejecta velocities ~>15,000 km/s. This would be expected if the ejecta
impacted a dense, clumpy circumstellar medium. This in turn caused them to lose
a fraction of their energy (~5 x 10^50 erg), less than 2% of which was
converted into radiation that sustained the light curve before maximum
brightness. This is reminiscent of the superluminous SN 2007bi, the light-curve
shape and spectra of which are very similar to those of PTF11rka, although the
latter is a factor of 10 less luminous and evolves faster in time. PTF11rka is
in fact more similar to gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) in luminosity,
although it has a lower energy and a lower KE/Mej ratio.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0003v1,"The Lick AGN Monitoring Project: Broad-Line Region Radii and Black Hole
  Masses from Reverberation Mapping of Hbeta","  We have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at
the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses
of the black holes in 12 nearby (z < 0.05) Seyfert 1 galaxies with expected
masses in the range ~10^6-10^7 M_sun and also the well-studied nearby active
galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including
NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the
monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the
continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad
Hbeta emission. We present here the light curves for the objects in this sample
and the subsequent Hbeta time lags for the nine objects where these
measurements were possible. The Hbeta lag time is directly related to the size
of the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured width
of the Hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine
the virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine AGNs. The
absolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalization
derived by Onken et al. We also examine the time lag response as a function of
velocity across the Hbeta line profile for six of the AGNs. The analysis of
four leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function of
velocity. However, SBS 1116+583A exhibits a symmetric time lag response around
the line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-line
region (BLR) clouds, and Arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is most
easily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. Further investigation
will be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical models
of the BLR by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2363v3,"SN 2010ay is a Luminous and Broad-lined Type Ic Supernova within a
  Low-metallicity Host Galaxy","  We report on our serendipitous pre-discovery detection and detailed follow-up
of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) 2010ay at z = 0.067 imaged by the
Pan-STARRS1 3pi survey just ~4 days after explosion. The SN had a peak
luminosity, M_R ~ -20.2 mag, significantly more luminous than known GRB-SNe and
one of the most luminous SNe Ib/c ever discovered. The absorption velocity of
SN 2010ay is v_Si ~ 19,000 km/s at ~40 days after explosion, 2-5 times higher
than other broad-lined SNe and similar to the GRB-SN 2010bh at comparable
epochs. Moreover, the velocity declines ~2 times slower than other SNe Ic-BL
and GRB-SNe. Assuming that the optical emission is powered by radioactive
decay, the peak magnitude implies the synthesis of an unusually large mass of
56 Ni, M_Ni = 0.9 M_solar. Modeling of the light-curve points to a total ejecta
mass, M_ej ~ 4.7 M_sol, and total kinetic energy, E_K ~ 11x10^51 ergs. The
ratio of M_Ni to M_ej is ~2 times as large for SN 2010ay as typical GRB-SNe and
may suggest an additional energy reservoir. The metallicity (log(O/H)_PP04 + 12
= 8.19) of the explosion site within the host galaxy places SN 2010ay in the
low-metallicity regime populated by GRB-SNe, and ~0.5(0.2) dex lower than that
typically measured for the host environments of normal (broad-lined) Ic
supernovae. We constrain any gamma-ray emission with E_gamma < 6x10^{48} erg
(25-150 keV) and our deep radio follow-up observations with the Expanded Very
Large Array rule out relativistic ejecta with energy, E > 10^48 erg. We
therefore rule out the association of a relativistic outflow like those which
accompanied SN 1998bw and traditional long-duration GRBs, but place
less-stringent constraints on a weak afterglow like that seen from XRF 060218.
These observations challenge the importance of progenitor metallicity for the
production of a GRB, and suggest that other parameters also play a key role.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3985v3,BICEP2 I: Detection Of B-mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales,"  (abridged for arXiv) We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a cosmic
microwave background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the
signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around
$\ell\sim80$. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting
optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition
edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of
$\approx300\mu\mathrm{K}_\mathrm{CMB}\sqrt{s}$. BICEP2 observed from the South
Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with
an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in
Stokes $Q$ and $U$. We find an excess of $B$-mode power over the base
lensed-LCDM expectation in the range $30< \ell< 150$, inconsistent with the
null hypothesis at a significance of $> 5\sigma$. Through jackknife tests and
simulations we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the
observed excess. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust
emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power
$\sim(5-10)\times$ smaller than the observed excess signal. However, these
models are not sufficiently constrained to exclude the possibility of dust
emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating
BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is
confirmed and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the
CMB, disfavoring dust at $1.7\sigma$. The observed $B$-mode power spectrum is
well fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0\sigma$.
Accounting for the contribution of foreground dust will shift this value

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02374v4,"First Cosmology Results using Type Ia Supernovae from the Dark Energy
  Survey: Constraints on Cosmological Parameters","  We present the first cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of
type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program
(DES-SN). The analysis uses a subsample of 207 spectroscopically confirmed SNe
Ia from the first three years of DES-SN, combined with a low-redshift sample of
122 SNe from the literature. Our ""DES-SN3YR"" result from these 329 SNe Ia is
based on a series of companion analyses and improvements covering SN Ia
discovery, spectroscopic selection, photometry, calibration, distance bias
corrections, and evaluation of systematic uncertainties. For a flat LCDM model
we find a matter density Omega_m = 0.331 +_ 0.038. For a flat wCDM model, and
combining our SN Ia constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), we find a dark energy equation of state w = -0.978 +_ 0.059, and Omega_m
= 0.321 +_ 0.018. For a flat w0waCDM model, and combining probes from SN Ia,
CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, we find w0 = -0.885 +_ 0.114 and wa =
-0.387 +_ 0.430. These results are in agreement with a cosmological constant
and with previous constraints using SNe Ia (Pantheon, JLA).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02379v4,"First Cosmology Results using Type Ia Supernova from the Dark Energy
  Survey: Simulations to Correct Supernova Distance Biases","  We describe catalog-level simulations of Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) light
curves in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN), and in
low-redshift samples from the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the Carnegie
Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model biases from
selection effects and light curve analysis, and to determine bias corrections
for SN~Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To
generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN~Ia model,
incorporates information from observations (PSF, sky noise, zero point), and
uses summary information (e.g., detection efficiency vs. signal to noise ratio)
based on 10,000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and
processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is
illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within
redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up to 0.05~mag over the redshift
ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly
those with extreme red or blue color, distance biases can reach 0.4~mag.
Therefore, accurately determining bias corrections is critical for precision

http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04184v1,"HARPS-N Solar Radial-Velocity Variations Are Dominated By Large, Bright
  Magnetic Regions","  State of the art radial-velocity (RV) exoplanet searches are currently
limited by RV signals arising from stellar magnetic activity. We analyze solar
observations acquired over a 3-year period during the decline of Carrington
Cycle 24 to test models of RV variation of Sun-like stars. A purpose-built
solar telescope at the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the
Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) provides disk-integrated solar spectra, from
which we extract RVs and $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$. The Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) provides disk-resolved images of magnetic activity. The Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) provides near-continuous solar photometry,
analogous to a Kepler light curve. We verify that the SORCE photometry and
HARPS-N $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$ correlate strongly with the SDO-derived magnetic
filling factor, while the HARPS-N RV variations do not. To explain this
discrepancy, we test existing models of RV variations. We estimate the
contributions of the suppression of convective blueshift and the rotational
imbalance due to brightness inhomogeneities to the observed HARPS-N RVs. We
investigate the time variation of these contributions over several rotation
periods, and how these contributions depend on the area of active regions. We
find that magnetic active regions smaller than $60 \ \rm Mm^2$ do not
significantly suppress convective blueshift. Our area-dependent model reduces
the amplitude of activity-induced RV variations by a factor of two. The present
study highlights the need to identify a proxy that correlates specifically with
large, bright magnetic regions on the surfaces of exoplanet-hosting stars.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08361v1,"Development and operations of INFN optical modules for the SCT Telescope
  camera proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory","  The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a proposal for the Medium Size
Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its concept is based on a
two-mirror optical system designed to improve the telescope field of view and
image resolution with respect to the single mirror Davies-Cotton solution. The
SCT camera is planned to be instrumented with 177 photodetection modules, each
composed of 64 Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. The third generation of
$6 x 6~mm^2$ high density NUV SiPMs (NUV-HD3) produced by Fondazione Bruno
Kessler (FBK) in collaboration with INFN has been used to equip optical units
to be integrated on the upgrade of the camera of the SCT prototype (pSCT). Each
optical unit is composed of an array of 16 NUV-HD3 SiPMs coupled with the
front-end electronics, which is designed for full-waveform nanosecond readout
and digitization using the TARGET-7 ASIC. Several optical units have been
assembled and tested in the laboratories of INFN and have been integrated on
the camera of the pSCT telescope, that is currently operating at the Fred
Lawrence Whipple Observatory. In this contribution we report on the

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05618v1,Noise from Undetected Sources in Dark Energy Survey Images,"  For ground-based optical imaging with current CCD technology, the Poisson
fluctuations in source and sky background photon arrivals dominate the noise
budget and are readily estimated. Another component of noise, however, is the
signal from the undetected population of stars and galaxies. Using injection of
artificial galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of
galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark
Energy Survey (DES) images is significantly in excess of the Poisson
predictions, by up to 30\%, and that the background sky levels are
overestimated by current software. By cross-correlating distinct images of
""empty"" sky regions, we establish that there is a significant image noise
contribution from undetected static sources (US), which on average are mildly
resolved at DES resolution. Treating these US as a stationary noise source, we
compute a correction to the moment covariance matrix expected from Poisson
noise. The corrected covariance matrix matches the moment variances measured on
the injected DES images to within 5\%. Thus we have an empirical method to
statistically account for US in weak lensing measurements, rather than
requiring extremely deep sky simulations. We also find that local sky
determinations can remove the bias in flux measurements, at a small penalty in
additional, but quantifiable, noise.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07385v1,"Constraints on the Physical Properties of S190814bv through Simulations
  based on DECam Follow-up Observations by the Dark Energy Survey","  On 14 August 2019, the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations alerted the astronomical
community of a high significance detection of gravitational waves and
classified the source as a neutron star - black hole (NSBH) merger, the first
event of its kind. In search of an optical counterpart, the Dark Energy Survey
(DES) Gravitational Wave Search and Discovery Team performed the most thorough
and accurate analysis to date, targeting the entire 90 percent confidence level
localization area with Blanco/DECam 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 16 nights after the
merger was detected. Objects with varying brightness were detected by the DES
Search and Discovery Pipeline and we systematically reduced the list of
candidate counterparts through catalog matching, light curve properties,
host-galaxy photometric redshifts, SOAR spectroscopic follow-up observations,
and machine-learning-based photometric classification. All candidates were
rejected as counterparts to the merger. To quantify the sensitivity of our
search, we applied our selection criteria to simulations of supernovae and
kilonovae as they would appear in the DECam observations. Since there are no
explicit light curve models for NSBH mergers, we characterize our sensitivity
with binary NS models that are expected to have similar optical signatures as
NSBH mergers. We find that if a kilonova occurred during this merger,
configurations where the ejected matter is greater than 0.07 solar masses, has
lanthanide abundance less than $10^{-8.56}$, and has a velocity between $0.18c$
and $0.21c$ are disfavored at the $2\sigma$ level. Furthermore, we estimate
that our background reduction methods are capable of associating gravitational
wave signals with a detected electromagnetic counterpart at the $4\sigma$ level
in $95\%$ of future follow-up observations.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08678v1,"Unravelling the complex behavior of Mrk 421 with simultaneous X-ray and
  VHE observations during an extreme flaring activity in April 2013","  We report on a multi-band variability and correlation study of the TeV blazar
Mrk 421 during an exceptional flaring activity observed from 2013 April 11 to
2013 April 19. The study uses, among others, data from GASP-WEBT, Swift,
NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and MAGIC. The large blazar activity, and the 43
hours of simultaneous NuSTAR and MAGIC/VERITAS observations, permitted
variability studies on 15 minute time bins, and over three X-ray bands (3-7
keV, 7-30 keV and 30-80 keV) and three very-high-energy (>0.1 TeV, hereafter
VHE) gamma-ray bands (0.2-0.4 TeV, 0.4-0.8 TeV and >0.8 TeV). We detected
substantial flux variations on multi-hour and sub-hour timescales in all the
X-ray and VHE gamma-ray bands. The characteristics of the sub-hour flux
variations are essentially energy-independent, while the multi-hour flux
variations can have a strong dependence on the energy of the X-ray and the VHE
gamma rays. The three VHE bands and the three X-ray bands are positively
correlated with no time-lag, but the strength and the characteristics of the
correlation changes substantially over time and across energy bands. Our
findings favour multi-zone scenarios for explaining the achromatic/chromatic
variability of the fast/slow components of the light curves, as well as the
changes in the flux-flux correlation on day-long timescales. We interpret these
results within a magnetic reconnection scenario, where the multi-hour flux
variations are dominated by the combined emission from various plasmoids of
different sizes and velocities, while the sub-hour flux variations are
dominated by the emission from a single small plasmoid moving across the
magnetic reconnection layer.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07984v3,"TOI-503: The first known brown dwarf-Am star binary from the TESS
  mission","  We report the discovery of an intermediate-mass transiting brown dwarf,
TOI-503b, from the TESS mission. TOI-503b is the first brown dwarf discovered
by TESS and orbits a metallic-line A-type star with a period of $P=3.6772 \pm
0.0001$ days. The light curve from TESS indicates that TOI-503b transits its
host star in a grazing manner, which limits the precision with which we measure
the brown dwarf's radius ($R_b = 1.34^{+0.26}_{-0.15} R_J$). We obtained
high-resolution spectroscopic observations with the FIES, Ond\v{r}ejov, PARAS,
Tautenburg, and TRES spectrographs and measured the mass of TOI-503b to be $M_b
= 53.7 \pm 1.2 M_J$. The host star has a mass of $M_\star = 1.80 \pm 0.06
M_\odot$, a radius of $R_\star = 1.70 \pm 0.05 R_\odot$, an effective
temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 7650 \pm 160$K, and a relatively high metallicity
of $0.61\pm 0.07$ dex. We used stellar isochrones to derive the age of the
system to be $\sim$180 Myr, which places its age between that of RIK 72b (a
$\sim$10 Myr old brown dwarf in the Upper Scorpius stellar association) and AD
3116b (a $\sim$600 Myr old brown dwarf in the Praesepe cluster). We argue that
this brown dwarf formed in-situ, based on the young age of the system and the
long circularization timescale for this brown dwarf around its host star.
TOI-503b joins a growing number of known short-period, intermediate-mass brown
dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars, and is the second such brown dwarf known
to transit an A star, after HATS-70b. With the growth in the population in this
regime, the driest region in the brown dwarf desert ($35-55 M_J \sin{i}$) is
reforesting and its mass range shrinking.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07240v2,"Search for multi-messenger signals in NOvA coincident with LIGO/Virgo
  detections","  Using the NOvA neutrino detectors, a broad search has been performed for any
signal coincident with 28 gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO/Virgo
Collaboration between September 2015 and July 2019. For all of these events,
NOvA is sensitive to possible arrival of neutrinos and cosmic rays of GeV and
higher energies. For five (seven) events in the NOvA Far (Near) Detector,
timely public alerts from the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration allowed recording of
MeV-scale events. No signal candidates were found.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00050v1,"A DESGW Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart to the LIGO/Virgo
  Gravitational Wave Binary Neutron Star Merger Candidate S190510g","  We present the results from a search for the electromagnetic counterpart of
the LIGO/Virgo event S190510g using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). S190510g is
a binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate of moderate significance detected
at a distance of 227$\pm$92 Mpc and localized within an area of 31 (1166)
square degrees at 50\% (90\%) confidence. While this event was later classified
as likely non-astrophysical in nature within 30 hours of the event, our short
latency search and discovery pipeline identified 11 counterpart candidates, all
of which appear consistent with supernovae following offline analysis and
spectroscopy by other instruments. Later reprocessing of the images enabled the
recovery of 6 more candidates. Additionally, we implement our candidate
selection procedure on simulated kilonovae and supernovae under DECam observing
conditions (e.g., seeing, exposure time) with the intent of quantifying our
search efficiency and making informed decisions on observing strategy for
future similar events. This is the first BNS counterpart search to employ a
comprehensive simulation-based efficiency study. We find that using the current
follow-up strategy, there would need to be 19 events similar to S190510g for us
to have a 99\% chance of detecting an optical counterpart, assuming a
GW170817-like kilonova. We further conclude that optimization of observing
plans, which should include preference for deeper images over multiple color
information, could result in up to a factor of 1.5 reduction in the total
number of followups needed for discovery.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08727v2,"Adjusting Neutrino Interaction Models and Evaluating Uncertainties using
  NOvA Near Detector Data","  The two-detector design of the NOvA neutrino oscillation experiment, in which
two functionally identical detectors are exposed to an intense neutrino beam,
aids in canceling leading order effects of cross-section uncertainties.
However, limited knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections still gives
rise to some of the largest systematic uncertainties in current oscillation
measurements. We show contemporary models of neutrino interactions to be
discrepant with data from NOvA, consistent with discrepancies seen in other
experiments. Adjustments to neutrino interaction models in GENIE that improve
agreement with our data are presented. We also describe systematic
uncertainties on these models, including uncertainties on multi-nucleon
interactions from a newly developed procedure using NOvA near detector data.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04497v1,"Searching for long-lived particles beyond the Standard Model at the
  Large Hadron Collider","  Particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) can generically have lifetimes that
are long compared to SM particles at the weak scale. When produced at
experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, these long-lived
particles (LLPs) can decay far from the interaction vertex of the primary
proton-proton collision. Such LLP signatures are distinct from those of
promptly decaying particles that are targeted by the majority of searches for
new physics at the LHC, often requiring customized techniques to identify, for
example, significantly displaced decay vertices, tracks with atypical
properties, and short track segments. Given their non-standard nature, a
comprehensive overview of LLP signatures at the LHC is beneficial to ensure
that possible avenues of the discovery of new physics are not overlooked. Here
we report on the joint work of a community of theorists and experimentalists
with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments --- as well as those working on
dedicated experiments such as MoEDAL, milliQan, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and FASER
--- to survey the current state of LLP searches at the LHC, and to chart a path
for the development of LLP searches into the future, both in the upcoming Run 3
and at the High-Luminosity LHC. The work is organized around the current and
future potential capabilities of LHC experiments to generally discover new
LLPs, and takes a signature-based approach to surveying classes of models that
give rise to LLPs rather than emphasizing any particular theory motivation. We
develop a set of simplified models; assess the coverage of current searches;
document known, often unexpected backgrounds; explore the capabilities of
proposed detector upgrades; provide recommendations for the presentation of
search results; and look towards the newest frontiers, namely high-multiplicity
""dark showers"", highlighting opportunities for expanding the LHC reach for
these signals.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09421v1,Complete measurement of $Λ$ electromagnetic form factors,"  The exclusive process $e^+e^-\rightarrow\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda
\to p\pi^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda} \to \bar{p}\pi^+$, has been studied at $\sqrt{s}
=$ 2.396 GeV for measurement of the $\Lambda$ electric and magnetic form
factors, $G_E$ and $G_M$. A data sample, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 66.9 pb$^{-1}$, was collected with the BESIII detector for this
purpose. A multi-dimensional analysis with a complete decomposition of the spin
structure of the reaction enables a determination of the modulus of the ratio
$R=|G_E/G_M|$ and, for the first time for any baryon, the relative phase
$\Delta\Phi=\Phi_E-\Phi_M$. The resulting values are obtained using the recent
and most precise measured value of the asymmetry parameter $\alpha_{\Lambda}$ =
$0.750~\pm~0.010$ to be $R~=~0.96\pm0.14~(\rm stat.)\pm~0.02~(\rm sys.)$ and
$\Delta\Phi=37^{\mathrm{o}}\pm~12^{\mathrm{o}}~(\rm
stat.)\pm~6^{\mathrm{o}}~(\rm sys.)$, respectively. In addition, the cross
section is measured with unprecedented precision to be $\sigma =
118.7~\pm~5.3~(\rm stat.)\pm~5.1~(\rm sys.)$ pb, which corresponds to an
effective form factor of $|G|=0.123~\pm~0.003~(\rm stat.)\pm~0.003~(\rm sys.)$.
The contribution from two-photon exchange is found to be negligible. Our result
enables the first complete determination of baryon time-like electromagnetic
form factors.
